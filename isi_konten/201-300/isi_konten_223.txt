1235-1242 AD: The Rise of Alexandar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Here, the historian Huwbert tells the story of the Divine Order after the death of Lucian - from the beginning of its internal divisions through the rise of the Voidwoken to Alexandar’s appointment of Dallis as his advisor and their rapid rise together to the head of the Order, with Alexandar as the Godwoken, the one chosen to succeed his father. Huwbert suspects, without naming names, that some within the Order are less than confident in Alexandar’s chances.*
Well, I may have misjudged you. But I can help you. I can fulfill your cheesy desires.
Kemm has been working to stop the God King&apos;s enemies entering Lucian&apos;s tomb.
Well met, traveller.

Forgive me, I shouldn&apos;t count my losses; count my blessings instead.
Blessed Source Infused
I couldn&apos;t agree more.
I saw what you did, you &lt;i&gt;fiend!&lt;/i&gt; You&apos;re a disgrace to Godwoken!
Best we head off, then. We&apos;ve got business to attend to.

*Tell her you insist. You&apos;re ready to be gone from this place.*

*Tangled amongst the mounds of corpses are glimpses of fractured spectral forms - pleading eyes, grasping hands, wailing mouths...*
Hold it right there! There&apos;s only one proper place for a vandal, and that&apos;s a prison cell. Come with me!
*The dreamer remains deep in his reverie. The voice flows through him to you once again.*
*Say you do what you can, when you must.*
Now go. My stomach rumbles and craves to nibble on your deliciousness. You should leave before I give in to the temptation...
I am... &lt;i&gt;nnggh&lt;/i&gt;... I am Arhu...
What?! BACAW! No! Peeper&apos;s still just a baby! And Papa can help!

You know about my... erm... situation, right?

*Roll your eyes. No, you want the entire speech again from the start.*
*Say that killing you only yields one meal. If she lets you go, you can fetch many meals for her.*
*Enthusiastically confirm Lohar was there singing dirty songs about Magisters.*
[SOLDIER] *You&apos;re no civilian. You&apos;ll help him win this war. If he helps you.*
*Move along.*
Oh, but you&apos;re a clever one, Godwoken, aren&apos;t you? Fine - you&apos;ve outed me. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
I would not have taken you for a wizard, if such a thing still exists. Tell me...

We killed the infernal lizards in the burning consulate.

Medium Thunder Rune Of Power
In truth, the torments of Braccus and of these Magisters were not so different. Both purged Source from this land.
*Say that you heard of her plight, but never fear - Braccus Rex has been long-vanquished.*
You must truly savour my company, Godwoken. Something you wanted?
Undead Elf
An undead, eh? Wonders never cease aboard this vessel...
This isn&apos;t what I need. There is another Soul Jar, inscribed with my name. Please, I beg you, bring it to me. It is of the utmost importance.
What could possibly be more urgent than getting this boat moving again?
Isbeil leached the Source from these people. How very... &lt;i&gt;clever&lt;/i&gt;.
The Eternal spoke of a strange Source-consuming device called &apos;The Aeteran&apos; - this is what Dallis was looking for.
Ah, yes, just what I needed! I tell you: dying just doesn&apos;t become a god.
*Pull him in closer, saying nothing.*
I... I feel it at work upon me already. Thank you, my friend.
*She would have you take the power of all the Gods? Even hers?*
No, you&apos;re right. You lack the dashing good looks with which I for one was blessed. Now good day to you. Feel free to let the door hit you on the way out, it may improve matters.
Elven elders claim that those who can understand the secrets whispered by this herb will be protected by the blessing of Tir-Cendelius himself.

Defeat the apparitions.
GAROOOOO!
*Ahem* Thief? What thief? We never spoke about any thief.
*Fulfil your destiny as the Godwoken. Become the new Divine.*
*Consider the boy. How amazing, that such a beast could don an innocent mask.*
Take on the Djinn.
I figure you look like a criminal. I&apos;m taking you to prison!
Perhaps that&apos;s because I don&apos;t quite enjoy broaching the subject.
&lt;b&gt;Fane understands. He understands that knowledge  has no limit. That curiosity cannot be chained.&lt;/b&gt;
*The Red Prince pinches the bridge of his nose in apparent irritation before turning his back on the jabbering Dreamer.*
BOCK!
Best of luck, my champion.

A man wearing a crown. But no king of mine.
Well hello! May you walk with Amadia.
I can&apos;t wait for this to be over. I don&apos;t want to see the next world yet.
There is but one promise I have ever regretted making, one deal I have ever sought to break. That tablet, the template to the Swornbreaker - it was the key to my freedom.
Mass Sabotage
Rooted
C&apos;mon! Have a drink!
*Tell her she&apos;s scaring you.*
Just as I&apos;ve been anxious to meet the famed Silver Claw. The stories are legendary, my good man. I recognise you on sight - as any Lone Wolf should.
*Roll your eyes and tell him to spit out whatever it is that he has in mind.*
The blow knocked him out. But he&apos;s not dead...
I am the secret of your soul! I should be your one true love, and you call me a &lt;i&gt;villain!&lt;/i&gt;
*The Magister is extremely flustered. She blushes bright red - red as a Magister&apos;s robe.*

The time for thinking is over, Lohse. It&apos;s a miracle the demon hasn&apos;t found us here already. We need to act. &lt;i&gt;Now.&lt;/i&gt;
Awwww buddy! This is the good stuff too, like what Kemm has in his garden with the Yarrow. Like right... therrre.
There&apos;s nothing here for you, brother. You should go back out front, where it&apos;s safe.
*Before you go, ask what it is he did to your eyes exactly.*
If you&apos;ll excuse me.
Fane travelled Rivellon, notebook in hand, recording the wonders he discovered. He kept a socket peeled for signs of the Eternals, hoping to find the wife he&apos;d lost. He&apos;s still looking.

Books and letters everywhere. It&apos;ll take ages to comb through!
You have no assigned characters. The host should access character assignment from the game menu and assign a character to you.
...&lt;i&gt;that&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; where you&apos;re to go. Someone name of Zaleskar&apos;ll meet you riiiiight there to tell you how to get up close with Alexandar. Scrawled it down? Then off you go.

Giant Poison Vial
*Kneel before the altar and pray to Zorl-Stissa.*
*The bloom&apos;s scent ribbons towards you until it fills your nostrils. Your whole body flushes. You&apos;re sure you must be glowing, so deep does the warmth dwell.*
*Sallow points a long-nailed finger at Alexandar&apos;s dead eye. Sickly waves of emotion wash from him (you feel like you&apos;ve eaten a rock) but you think you recognise the feeling; it&apos;s love... or at least a form of love.*
As much, I imagine, as you think of gadflies that buzz about you.
Explode, dealing [1] in a large area around you, creating a Cursed Electrified cloud.
*Don&apos;t move a muscle. Let your lips linger.* &lt;br&gt;
*That looked like an intense conversation with that Eternal. Ask Fane if he&apos;s okay.*
What kind of person are you, to prey on the recently bereaved? My husband &lt;i&gt;loves me!&lt;/i&gt; He would never dream of something like that.
Find somewhere that peddles alertness herb mixes, then add the ridgeback that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; gave you - the effects of the new mixture could be quite interesting...
*Grimace. Really? That&apos;s his big lead? A lost Sourcerer that might be dead?*
*The Magister goes slightly slack for a brief moment, as though nothing but her spine were keeping her upright.*
So just... come find me.
*You&apos;re always charmed to meet some free power. Consume Pavlonia&apos;s Source.*

The spirit of Brother Robert was jailer to a victim of demonic possession.
Onward, Quercus! Onward, Shield! Until the Great Acorn drops, there&apos;s still hope.
After that came the indignity of the collar and incarceration, but ever since we decided to be so bold as to bid our farewell to Fort Joy by any means, it&apos;s all been rather... fun.
Nothing in there for me, poppet. You &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt;. The only meat in this room is draped over your bones. And I will have it.
Adorable little thing. I bet its neck snaps as easily as a baby&apos;s.

Satisfied, are you? Now that you&apos;ve gotten what you wanted, I suggest you get lost. JUST DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
You again? Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m rather busy?
*He gives you a long, cool look... then relents. He flicks the sword over and offers it to you, hilt-first. It&apos;s a simple weapon, well-made and well-maintained. It&apos;s clean, but it feels... tainted.*
*The Magister looks you up and down with utter dispassion.*
*Ask why a Lone Wolf mercenary would be moving contraband.*
You will feel whole once again, child - you have my word. I will guide you, but first you must return to the world and escape that island.
So, what do you think you&apos;ll do now that we live in a world of minute Divines?
Kemm? &lt;i&gt;Linder&lt;/i&gt; Kemm? This rot has infected the very soil we tread and the air we breathe. I must not let it reach the kingdom...

This works for me. Let&apos;s just forget the whole thing, then. I go my way, you go yours.
