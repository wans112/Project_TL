&lt;i&gt;As Divine, I was created - empowered - to stop the Void. I was the avatar of the Seven: their strength - and their weakness. My bond to them allowed me to drain them of their Source.&lt;/i&gt;
*The chest responds with more hissing. It&apos;s a language, but you don&apos;t understand it. Given the pictograms, you assume it&apos;s an ancient lizard tongue.*
*You approach an Undead standing proud at the lip of a broken bridge. Understandably fearless of the fatal drop, she gazes into the lava sputtering below. Turning to you, she motions to the Black Ring corpses at her feet.*
B-but he hasn&apos;t returned. If Sir Gareth doesn&apos;t come back with those weapons in tow, well... t-this island will be our grave.
Tovah - my mother - and the others. They wait for me. The Ancestors know what we will do next...
Still, I know you&apos;ll brave any danger that stands in your way, for I&apos;ve heard speak of the prophecy. You are the father of dragons, O majesty, and the mother of dragons calls upon you in her hour of need!
Saying a special phrase will make the spores grow and spew poison.
I won&apos;t say it again. Let. Me. OUT!
This book is smudged and slick from being handled with oily fingers.
UGH. People are &lt;i&gt;awful.&lt;/i&gt;
[IFAN] *Tell him you can&apos;t rest: duty calls.*
&lt;i&gt;People? &lt;/i&gt;Oh, goodness no. I&apos;ve been victimising the Black Ring. Do you really think of them as &lt;i&gt;people?&lt;/i&gt;
The look of surprise on his corpse! I mean, what did he expect?
Please... tend to the Seekers. I need some time...
A robbery!
Having escaped the Nameless Isle, soon we may cross paths with Adramahlihk.
I guessed as much. Blood even colder than a snowbound lizard&apos;s.
Hrrmm... fine - you can help. Take this key and go to the cellar. I&apos;ll join you there.
*Grip him by the arm. It&apos;s been a pleasure.*
Frame Cap
This is madness!
I won&apos;t see them tossed overboard. Not here. We&apos;ll hold a proper service.
*He places a hand over your heart and you suddenly feel it, an unmistakeable pull in a new and distant direction.*
Invaders
Innkeeper&apos;s Safe
I&apos;m no Godwoken, I have no place on the Nameless Isle. All I can do is urge you to contemplate with the greatest of care every move you make.
With or without us, the God King rises, Godwoken. And he &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; hold you to your promise.
*Before you can remove it, it vanishes. You stand unmasked before the figure.*
Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me...
I mean - well, yes, it was rather pleasant, wasn&apos;t it?
We should check the bodies, watch the trail... this doesn&apos;t bode well.
This invasive fungus is sturdier than a rock, so much so that it was used as armour by elves of ancient times.
*Suggest that Rory might be still for a moment if he had something to nibble on.*
Pick up a scent, did ya?
Combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is played in &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;rounds&lt;/font&gt;. Everything you do in combat costs &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Action Points (AP)&lt;/font&gt;, which you receive each round. Your turn ends when you have no AP left.
You will never be deemed worthy without sacrifice.
In the end, he was brave enough to fight Braccus. That counts for something.
After death, the souls of Scions join an ever-growing network of Ancestor Trees. Thus is elven power preserved.
*Note that Kemm seems to be rather sanguine about the situation. Ask why.*
Should she come close to ascension, you may not hesitate. Stand ready to end her, even if it breaks your heart.
*Leave them to it.*
To die at the hands of a human is insulting and unjust. I will have blood for her blood!
Seekers: Dead. Alexandar: Missing. Godwoken passengers: Deceased.
The Womb
I am truly sorry, Lohse, that I couldn&apos;t exorcise the demon, but do not despair. I will not give up on you. We must simply take a darker path still: confront Adramahlihk in his lair and deal with the demon face to face.
*Say you weren&apos;t told about any extra-contractual &lt;i&gt;errands.*&lt;/i&gt;
Resolve the situation.
No matter what happens next, Shield, there&apos;s something Quercus and I want you to know:
Uniformed corpses litter the approaches to Arx. It seems the Magisters teeter on the brink of defeat.
Very good. Now for some answers...
A Mistake once made; from Lucian, turncoat strayed.
Please, lizard. Go.
*Question her: Too late for what?*
Buddy the dog asked us to find his mate, Emmie.
This is the worst dream I&apos;ve ever had.
The Gods can&apos;t remove that collar of yours, however. Go to the Sanctuary. See Leya. She&apos;ll free you from it.
Poisonous Wand
Marcus!
&lt;i&gt;Bring it.&lt;/i&gt;
After our last little escapade with your &apos;Voidwoken&apos; I examined the corpses you left behind. They were imbued with dark power, but I believe I-
ENOUGH! You can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you...
[SOLDIER] *Salute and ask his permission to enter the premises.*
But I am not fully... myself.
*The silent soldier looks you from head to foot without moving her head.*
Don&apos;t tell me the Sourcerer chased you away, &lt;i&gt;merc?&lt;/i&gt;
Pin a &lt;font color=#e3a312&gt;Location&lt;/font&gt; to the map
Finn
You&apos;re under arrest for obstruction of justice, or something. Better ready yourself for a prison stay.
She&apos;s holding court in the sewers, if you can believe it. Go to my wine cellar, pull out the vintage called &apos;Lulabelle&apos;. It will open the way for you.
Malady won&apos;t set sail without Gareth. We should look for him in Paradise Downs.
Heinous Ring
Malady said something about the ship&apos;s figurehead, didn&apos;t she?
Wooden Cross
I serve only one.
Can you believe this school was teeming with students just a year ago? Everything changed so fast. And it&apos;s the kids that suffer.
Very well. Keep an eye out. Danger lurks everywhere, it seems.
Puppet Bead
Talking Shell, Cooked
*Shake your head and turn away.*
*The Paladin shrieks, folding in on himself as the armour seems to sag. When it straightens, it has become something else.*
Stop right there! Someone, help!
Now listen closely. Rumour has it that Lord Kemm&apos;s mansion is built upon a massive vault in which he hides his true valuables. His entire house is but a smoke screen for the real treasure hidden underneath.
Blood-Stained Journal
We&apos;re both busy people. Why don&apos;t you get busy somewhere else, while I stay busy here?
&lt;b&gt;By all means, go out and eat your fill, but you will leave this one alone. She&apos;s &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
Your grace, I&apos;m sure you do not mean to insult me.
*A dark night in a filthy alleyway, under shadows cast by the light of a full moon.*
Her powers of sight proved useful in the ongoing war against the Void.
I don&apos;t have &lt;i&gt;buddies&lt;/i&gt;. I have associates.
*Assure him you&apos;ll do as you promised and take your leave.*
*Greet Ryker, and say you&apos;ve been anxious to find him.*
Count on a &lt;i&gt;human &lt;/i&gt;order to pervert their devotion to the Divine into...this.
*Prays...* I pledge my heart, O Lucian. Please return. I pledge my soul, O Lucian. Please return. I pledge my life, O Lucian. Please return. *Mumbles...* Because we&apos;re in the cack right now and we need your help...
Heh! That&apos;ll happen here. Hope you&apos;re holdin&apos; up alright in any case.
*Kindly inform her that she is, in fact, deceased.*
You already know you&apos;re not welcome here. I won&apos;t warn you again.
*Inform her of your visit with Lohar. You need to get through the hatch.*
Forgotten Cleaver
Squeeeeeeee!
*Huh. You suppose he&apos;s right.*
Beast&apos;s quarry Lohar is in the village of Driftwood.
Pa told me elves AND lizards AND dwarves bring bad guys. Void guys. That&apos;s right, isn&apos;t it?
*Grab the idiot by the collar and pull him into a kiss.*
Cooking notes...? Wait - there&apos;s something wrong with this...
Well before you go blood-crazed, you should know the queen&apos;s no friend of mine. Not no more.
*Tell her she&apos;d do better to have you as a friend than an enemy.*
Or, indeed, you could stand there, gawping as if your master had just ordered you to fly. Whatever fits your purpose, my dear.
*Narrow your eyes and ask what &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; plan is.*
Crying won&apos;t erase the past. Pick up, and move on.
*Query whether there&apos;s anything more that can be done for the injured.*
*A moment passes.*
Pepper
It won&apos;t stop. Since we locked up Mordus, his voice - it just won&apos;t stop...

Wh... what? Who are you? Who are you really?!
What&apos;s this? An intruder?
I was right. You only have yourself to blame for this!
Despicable little ants. Crawling into our business...
Humans make stupid choices and then they die. It is their condition. Must we weep over every carcass we find?
[VILLAIN] *Smile. Between the Black Ring&apos;s war and the Voidwoken, uncountable numbers have died.*
To reign over a Divine Order soaked in corruption and bloodshed? No better candidate than Alexandar...
Because you look so very thirsty. Oh, not for wine or water. But for Source?
Cavern Lava
Higba escaped the region. Maybe we&apos;ll see him again.
*Beast brushes detritus from his beard - sand, skin, and whatever else might have accumulated there. He takes a deep breath when he sees you.*
Venomous Aura Skillbook
*Thank him. On balance you had a really good time.*
Maybe something that scares demons is something &lt;i&gt;friendly&lt;/i&gt;...
Just pray they&apos;re not at attacking the Elf temple. Might be they&apos;ve gone to meet the God King already.
...kill him!
I have battled the foe of foes, and conquered it - for a while. I have sat in perfumed gardens with the Source herself; drank life from her very lips.
As the lever&apos;s fixed, you could... perhaps you could extract him. But you&apos;d have to be able to contain him, defeat him, once he&apos;d been loosed. Who am I to say if you&apos;re prepared for that.
Ah, yes. The dream visions...
It&apos;s my mentor. My dear mentor. He was... *sniff* killed. By those Void beasts. I told him we ought not to travel in the hills, but would he listen?
I&apos;ve never been so embarrassed.
*Tell him you&apos;ve little faith in visions.*
*Suddenly she goes limp against you. Foul air rushes from her mouth in a whisper...*
&lt;i&gt;&apos;That Magister&apos;&lt;/i&gt; - that was &lt;i&gt;Bishop Alexandar.&lt;/i&gt; Leader of the Divine Order. And his right hand, Dallis. How do you not know this?
*Nibble.*
Good girl.
Wood
*Chant an elvish children&apos;s song about a foolish human who tried to fight the sea.*
*Tell him that he can trust you - your intentions are good.*
Select your controller type. This determines what controller graphics you see in tutorial messages and user interfaces.
I will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; forget this slight.
*The guard shifts uncomfortably. He swallows, his mouth apparently dry. When he speaks, it&apos;s with the weariness of one who&apos;ll be carrying a heavy heart for years to come. If he lives that long - which seems unlikely.*
Oh, you&apos;re a thief, alright. Now, meet the judge, jury, and executioner.
Praise be! You have silenced the Shriekers and cleared our way! Yet it seems I&apos;m in need of you again, my friend.
All Skilled Up
I&apos;m no fan of Magisters, not anymore. But I can&apos;t help but think that Alexandar&apos;s death was... unfortunate. Dallis is only making &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; worse.
I will keep my eye on you. The good one.
Lizard Sabre
*Tell her she dropped something.*
We found a catatonic little girl lying at the heart of the vault, bound by otherworldly chains attached to four pillars. Her undead cat, Buttons, remained at her side.
Physical resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
You do things your way, I&apos;ll do them mine.
Would you believe, Brother Kalvin locked me up in here because he said I was POSSESSED! By a DEMON! Just because I... don&apos;t feel PAIN. Have you ever heard anything so, so, so &lt;i&gt;superstitious?&lt;/i&gt;
Wonderful!
