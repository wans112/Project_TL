So. Here we are again.
Indeed they are. No wife to waste her inheritance - no aunt to shame me for following my calling.
*The cub nervously ambles away.*
[SEBILLE] *Look her straight in the eyes and tell her she has no idea what true desire is.*
*Pat the dwarf on his shoulder and take your leave.*
[FANE] *Ask why you should take orders from an incomplete human.*
*Ask to see his wares.*
[1] makes you less prone to be detected while performing suspicious acts.
They&apos;re preparing for war with the Divine Order, with all three Houses riled up in a frenzy. The House of Dreams are communing with dead warriors, the House of Law are drawing up new maps for after the war.
*She comes back to herself for the first time. She fixes you with an impish look.*
Thralls to Almira! I borrow yore grunts, mistress, the Divine Order pigs be here at the temple and I would have yore pets kill them.
*She glances at you quickly, then looks away again.*
To arms! His savage minions have found us!
*Reimond primes the grenade. It starts to hiss.*
*The queen opens her mouth as if to speak, but Beast cuts her off with an ominous growl.*
Thank you, mister. Now if you don&apos;t mind we&apos;re busy waiting for our friend.
They ran like rats from a burning shed, so they must have left some clue - some trail. Find it - follow it - and bring me the location of their den.
I&apos;m glad you decided to put that moment of doubt behind you. The last thing we need here is more... &lt;i&gt;unpleasantness&lt;/i&gt;.
Diseased
*She wipes a grubby hand on her tunic and holds it out for you to shake.*
I know this type of mechanism. Justinia&apos;s preferred sort of keyhole. Well... brickhole.
*He points to the carriage parked just outside the garden and shivers.*
Axe in the Woods
I&apos;ve been asking myself the same question! They said I did some really bad things, but I&apos;d &lt;i&gt;never &lt;/i&gt;do anything&lt;i&gt; wrong. &lt;/i&gt;Never ever! Oh please, let me out!
Please, go ahead.
Investigate the lamp.
Crafting Requirements
Not so fast, trespasser.
&lt;br&gt;Character is unable to move.
As the Prime Scion, Sebille took root and became the Mother Tree, carrying all hope for the future of the elves on her shoulders.
In that case, I&apos;m delighted as well!
*Ask why he&apos;d enquire after such a horrible thing.*
Change hotbar item
*She feigns modesty for a blink, then delight shines in her eyes.*
Boss can take care of himself. I&apos;d like to see your friend try that with&lt;i&gt; him...&lt;/i&gt;
Is it really made of livewood?
&apos;ullo, lady!
Yeah! Yeah. Yes. True!
Forgive me, Gareth...
&apos;til over-boiling a bit of cabbage becomes a crime, I shall hold my head steady.
Rarity
*The fire slug quivers with anger.*
*Lohse is still and quiet; her eyes flashing grey, then black, then draining back to normal.*
Two-Handed Bonecutter
My, how long it&apos;s been... how very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;long it&apos;s been...
Medium Potion of Shadow
*Tell her you&apos;re right behind her.*
*Something within the device grates and groans - yet the cell&apos;s shield holds.*
Arrrgh... the fire... it burns... it won&apos;t stop...!
We found Sech Zapor&apos;s captain&apos;s log.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;REST.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*The dwarf beams. His excitement at meeting a fabled freedom fighter is tempered only by the fretting human keeping him company.*
Sarias&apos; Body
*A glazed look passes over Mihaly&apos;s eyes. He smiles benignly.*
*Mock the big bad Lone Wolf who can&apos;t say his dead girlfriend&apos;s name.*
Poisoned Mug of Ambrosia
Nothing we didn&apos;t see coming.
Arena Artefact
No. Your soul must grow larger still; your inner self become a vaster expanse so that it may house your divine power.
Falcon&apos;s Eye
Dorian Gall is only marrying for money. He intends to inherit his father-in-law&apos;s wealth - perhaps sooner, rather than later.
Liam&apos;s ghost wants revenge on his killer.
My champion! You&apos;ve come not a moment too soon. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt; Even &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt;
Sharp Tooth
The secrets to the universe could have lain behind that curtain, but I was not given the chance to find out.
Let&apos;s keep it that way, kid. I&apos;d hate to think what&apos;d happen to you if you went runnin&apos; to the Reds with a thing like that.
*...you stole the capacitor from the Chancellor&apos;s own table. But then you heard a noise. You heard the sound of Raedalus&apos; murder. You fled.*
Ghada Ganem
Please, I hold this boon. It is Amadia&apos;s. It should be yours.
Apotheosis
[UNDEAD] *Smile and tell him that Death as an anthropomorphic entity is... inaccurate.*
We would never blame Gareth. The righteous always pay a price. May the Seven will it, he will always be the hero we know him to be.
*Stingtail. House of Dreams. Turned to crab food on the shores of Fort Joy.*
Possessed Dwarf
And I will not force your hand. Speak to my mentor Gratiana should you change your mind. She is the true priestess of Amadia, blessed be her name on the wind and in the streams.
*Tell her you should have.*
Armoire
Hallowed are its halls. Please, comrade, I have all you need to steel yourself against the brutes that haunt this place. I will accept no more than a pittance for all you may require.
Keep talking, dwarf, and you&apos;ll end up eating sawdust from a cell floor.
*Ask who the kin insulted.*
*Whisper a few words of healing magic as you place a hand over the wound.*
But that can&apos;t be helped now, I suppose. Not everyone received the same &lt;i&gt;education &lt;/i&gt;as my Kniles - he&apos;s a Magister, mind -  did. So, what&apos;re you after.
*You understand. Say that you accept.*
Digging into other people&apos;s graves? Beware the creak-click-bang! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Consider me at your service, if you need anything else.
*You don&apos;t trust the voice. Fight the vision!*
Hi, famous lady!
Wow. Alright. Here. The last of my gold, then.
*The priestess is oblivious to you - instead, she&apos;s locked in frantic, &lt;i&gt;desperate &lt;/i&gt;prayer...*
[BARBARIAN] *Grab his throat and say that you&apos;ll have the ring &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his money.*
You can&apos;t hide forever...
Is there not enough reason to speed away?
Ah, that hit the spot!
Why am I still here? Why can&apos;t I leave to the Halls?
*Point out that she&apos;s alone, unarmed, and there&apos;s a shipful of Seekers who&apos;d happily throw her overboard. She&apos;s in no position to be making demands.*
Cendrillia&apos;s Trousers
*A young man in oversized armour paces around a table covered with a spread of maps, his face a tight scowl of frustration.*
*Ask the child what game she&apos;s playing.*
Eh - I wish I could be so... what&apos;s the word... non-CHA-lant? But I&apos;m not a free man anymore. I belong to Rivellon now.
Aw - t&apos;ain&apos;t nothin&apos;. The sailors sing what&apos;s in their hearts. Keeps spirits high when the sails droop.
Oh... did I... did I say something wrong?
Pilgrim Shell
*She licks her lips until they shine brightly, and winks her approval.*
I don&apos;t wish to minimise your struggles, prince, but do remember I beknight women and men who have overcome obstacles far greater. Isbeil - is there more to tell?
*You are hungry for work. Hungry for skin under your nails. A shrouded figure comes to you in the night. He says nothing but slips you a neatly folded contract. Its seal is from the Ancient Empire - a house you don&apos;t recognise.*
*Stare at the woman before you. You can barely even remember her face...*
The encrusted blood still sticking to this dagger reminds you of something Mama always told you. Those who deny their appetites make up for them in other ways. One way or another, the blood will flow...
*Jimmy remains dead, uninterested in answering petty questions about the world of the living.*
Creates a poisonous cloud. When targeting a character, deals [1].
There was a time when you wielded tremendous power. You must search &lt;i&gt;within &lt;/i&gt;yourself and unlock that power once more. And then...
Just... &lt;i&gt;be careful&lt;/i&gt;. It&apos;s clear she&apos;s a powerful Sourcerer, but also whatever she was subjected to has warped her, in body and mind. I have her locked up for good reason...
What?! Lucian&apos;s truth - I misjudged you, Godwoken. Perhaps there is yet hope for this little undertaking of ours.
*Her look is equal parts nonplussed and embarrassed.*
*Ask him what he sees just beyond the portal.*
*Relent, and consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Xiuh will mourn Consul Zara, but will also be glad to know her effects are in the hands of a kin.
*Allow the gentle rhythm of the song to caress your mind. With each note, tension leaves your muscles. A smile plays about your lips.*
*Say you&apos;re glad to have her on your team.*
*Point out her paltry selection. If she tells you how to find her helpers, you can get them access to more cheeses.*
*Say that their methods are harsh, but you believe they have good intentions.*
Rot take you! I will hear no more.
So the Order&apos;s right about one thing: we attract Voidwoken.
We declined the Doctor&apos;s pact.
Rupture Tendons
[ELF] *Express your concern. A Scion has been lost?*
*Repeat your question, a little louder.*
Incandescent Arracheur
*Growl...*
*Before you lies a primitive altar to the Seven, apparently constructed during a bygone era. Something about it appeals to you - a faint heat emanating from the stones, perhaps.*
Well... what people &lt;i&gt;believe &lt;/i&gt;about my role as the keeper of Lucian&apos;s tomb is all part of the Divine&apos;s plan.
*Allow yourself and all the world to be purged of its Source.*
*Tell her you were happy to help and take your leave.*
No. None does. Yet.
A rune of magic, bone engraved&lt;br&gt;The cold of death must meet the bane&lt;br&gt;Of venom pure, a poison vial&lt;br&gt;Create the venom rune most vile
Oh hi.
&apos;Ere, leave them barrels alone! I told you to take a hike. So scram!
Sure you don&apos;t want to take a look at my stock before you go? I was serious about what I said. Everything in my pack&apos;s been got by &lt;i&gt;special &lt;/i&gt;means.
Void Howl
*She lowers her head and turns towards the young boy&apos;s corpse.*
Safe travels, dear.
Imposing Statue
Wait- no! Where are you going? You can&apos;t just walk away!
One day a doctor came to &apos;im. Zin was his name. And Zin said he could cure the emperor&apos;s disease. The emperor agreed to his poultice of herbs &apos;n&apos; black rose petals - and it worked! The emperor was, it seems, cured - as long as he continued treatment.
The Prophecy
Stunning Water Grenade
One senses that the &apos;Tyrant&apos;s Stride&apos; may hinder, not help.
Again? We are fortunate indeed to have you.
*The eyes of the dwarves look strange, but you can&apos;t quite make them out from this distance. *
That time is past... That fight is done... You must fight your own fight... You must win... your own war.
A great pity.
It goes to show; being born to a higher purpose can be a blessing... or a curse.
Lohar&apos;s gonna want t&apos;know about our little... encounter... with Mordus. Let&apos;s get that amulet to him.
You sneak around my house like a rat. You would have been welcome to use the front door. You&apos;re always welcome at my home in this realm, Lohse. But you should have left the other well enough alone.
&apos;Here lies Old Man Mallic.&lt;br&gt;(No Dancing on This Grave.)&apos;
Flabber&apos;s Ghastly Hat
The Advocate offered us the Source of a tormented soul in a distant dungeon. We accepted.
I&apos;ve never seen the likes of this before - and there&apos;s no bloody chance I&apos;m going in there!
Though I do hope she&apos;s alright. I know the Seekers didn&apos;t fare so well, but my sister&apos;s always had a way of getting out of scrapes.
*Angrily retort there is nothing to explain. You are a Sourcerer. You are no gods-damned Magister. She&apos;ll either lower that crossbow, or shoot you. It&apos;s her choice.*
