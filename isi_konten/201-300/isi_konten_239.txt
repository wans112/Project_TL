*The spirit utters one last scream, then vanishes in mid-air.*
*Opt not to proceed with their request right now.*
There are more Masters of the Source, more aspects of the Source to learn. The hunt continues, Sebille.
It was a stupid bloody accident... I dosed myself with some poison, to make it look like I was half-dead. I figured they&apos;d take me to see a healer, and I&apos;d have a chance to escape...
*Say that if he wants to find out, there&apos;s something you need to know.*
*Admit that if someone had likewise scarred you, your reaction might have been the same.*
[SOLDIER] *Order him to give you his sword, &lt;i&gt;on the double!*&lt;/i&gt;
Tschhhhhh... this is such a waste of time.
Apple
*She looks you up and down. Slowly. It is clear that you are found wanting.*
DAMNED YOU BE! YOU SWORE YOUR ALLEGIANCE. &lt;i&gt;THIS WILL NOT STAND!&lt;/i&gt;
Ha! Quercus! Quercus, it thinks it can use magic at our level. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s adorable or just sad.
Cocoa
Ryker
Now &lt;i&gt;get the hell away from me&lt;/i&gt;.
Nuh-uh.
She is sick with fog that undid so many. She is dying... We&apos;ve need of a new mother. Of &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
There&apos;s still blood on the cobbles, and yet those blasted traders are right back at it, flogging their wares! What happened to respect for the dead?
earth damage
No, you are here to witness the magnificence granted to the faithful.
*She scowls and braces for your assault.*
Lulabelle
*The corner of Gareth&apos;s lip begins to twitch. He places a marker on your map.*
*The tendrils of his mind idly dance across the surface of your brain, sending you flashes of your own torture and excruciating death. Inside your head, the Sallow Man smiles.*
Ugly thing, innit.
You&apos;re back. And you&apos;re still alive. Well done, sir. Well done!
*The child whimpers, poking at a maternal instinct you&apos;ve rarely acknowledged.*
I don&apos;t rightly know... the Paladins came, intent on ransacking the barracks... the fighting started so quickly... before I knew it, I was wounded, and Wainslow was hauling me away...
Careful now, my wrath may be terrible...
*Say you will.*
Slay the Shadow Prince. Take his heart.
Maeve
*Invisible force staggers you, shoving you like a mob on all sides. It wants you beaten down, brought to heel.*
And? Got no reason to scramble out, me. S&apos;hot and busy out there. S&apos;cool and quiet in here. Or at least, it &lt;i&gt;used &lt;/i&gt;to be.
*He drops your hand and opens the book once more.*
Config Missing
I sincerely believe you. Well stranger, you may always make a home here.  You are most welcome in this place.
I eagerly await what comes.
I must admit, I was worried that I may not be worthy of Divinity, but travelling with you has shown me just how low that bar is set.
Ya think I&apos;m takin&apos; pleasure in this? I feel for the lass, she ain&apos;t no stranger.
*About the queen...*
To the Dungeon and Kniles
*Deny it. Claim not to be Godwoken.*
I hope you&apos;ve been practicing that little trick I taught you...
Rabid Lupine Horror
You&apos;re a silver-tongued devil, alright. I take the contraband. But I&apos;m not letting this go.
Still haunting the garden, my friend?
Ha. &lt;i&gt;The same boat&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask the rat if he&apos;s being sarcastic.*
Lucky, you are.
*Say you&apos;re not so sure you met with Rhalic actually.*
Raanaar chest
SPECIAL
*The angelic figure stands upon a mosaic that depicts a dragon - or a leviathan.*
[IFAN] *Composed as can be, tell her that&apos;s impossible. You hit him. And you &lt;i&gt;never &lt;/i&gt;miss.*
You&apos;ve received a new Talent: Rooted
You&apos;ll get a fight if&apos;n ya want it so badly. Did Mordus send ya, cud-eatin&apos; coward that he is?
A father knows when he may trust in his children and when he must intervene. I know that you will succeed, if you choose it.
Wheelbarrow
Preparing for an Adventure
Auntie Flann
*Take your leave.*
Mmm, both wise &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;well-mannered. You&apos;ll go far, I&apos;m sure. And I do hope I get to watch.
Thus endeth the lesson.
Full Hotbar Deck
An extraordinary being has left us... a shame. There&apos;s nobody of intellectual prowess left for me to speak with on this ship - spectral as it may be.
I was on duty in your room when the murder happened - you were asleep the whole time. Didn&apos;t even stir.
For you, &lt;i&gt;rava&lt;/i&gt;, no bother. As your discount&apos;s still a go, it&apos;ll be cheap... if you have the coin, of course. (cheap [GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
*...as &lt;i&gt;the Sallow Man.*&lt;/i&gt;
Witch
You! The deserter, the reason my daughter is dead. Saheila... dead.
*The dangerous dark? Is she hypnotising you? Trapping you? Grab her; stop her!*
I&apos;ll not stand for such unwonted aggression! En garde!
A frost-capped arrow that bites deep and stops targets in their tracks.
*Draw yourself up. You know all about the contract on your head!*
*Ask where you are. What is this place?*
And what might you mean by &lt;i&gt;that?&lt;/i&gt;
That&apos;s making my skin crawl, but I find myself strangely... fascinated.
Cutter
*Something is different. Your mask is intact, yet you know your disguise has dropped away. You are &lt;i&gt;seen...*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her not to worry. &apos;To lose&apos; is a complete abstract to you.*
How could you be so &lt;i&gt;stupid, &lt;/i&gt;Justinia? How could &lt;i&gt;I? &lt;/i&gt;Gods damn it all!
That poor Magister.
*Remark that the cake rather blew up the party. Explain that it was filled with explosive toys.*
*Quickly agree. You&apos;ll do whatever it takes.*
To your own nightmares I pray you tend. Amid smoke and shadow, I must foster my own.
I have needs too. I&apos;ll meet yours - if you meet mine.
[OUTLAW] *Crack your knuckles and say that you know some tongue-loosening techniques.
Every moment we stand around here the trail of the Whites grows colder... but Kemm still clings to his false hopes.
Two-Handed Human Axe
[1] gives you +[2] to Bartering.
*Swann gingerly picks up some forceps with his good hand and tries to remove the maggot...*
...after all. I am soon to be a free woman - I can choose to follow whomever I wish now.
Hard to fathom such magic, even when it&apos;s right before your eyes.
*Exclaim that you knew it!*
Ah, gold! Humanity&apos;s favourite metal. Very well, let&apos;s redistribute some wealth.
That, I fear, is where you&apos;re wrong.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him you hate it when slavelings attempt flattery.*
*She ignores you and continues calling out for her Erma.*
Not enough Source Points&lt;br&gt;
But the war changed everything. He sent me to save the elves I grew up amongst. I arrived too late.
The Divine worked in mysterious ways and it was not our place to question him. I hope his spirit will forgive me for for breaking my oath.
*Smile and tell him you&apos;re alright. In fact, you feel wonderful.*
*Shake your head and walk away. You don&apos;t want any part of this.*
*Make the sign of the Lone Wolf.*
*He steps forward, taking you in his arms. Your hands run down his chest, across silken robes.*
Gotta get to the Queen, then. This shite sure in the hell goes higher than Lohar. I&apos;ll let &apos;er know about yer deeds, though. Good lass, ya are.
Acid Infusion
I didn&apos;t come all this way to show &lt;i&gt;deference&lt;/i&gt;. Some friendly advice... all who rise are capable of falling - gods, the Divine... anyone. Remember where you came from; the last thing this world needs is more tyrants.
*Ask what it meant to her.*
This place was home once. Now I&apos;m not sure what &apos;home&apos; even means.
*Frown and say that he was a Godwoken - one of the chosen few. He shouldn&apos;t doubt his self-worth in this way.*
From Garvan&apos;s flesh we learned that he killed Liam, his master, somewhere near a bridge.
Why the long face? Come on, everyone knows that one. Don&apos;t waste my time.
I&apos;m doin&apos; me duty here, I am. I&apos;m the lookout and I&apos;m ringin&apos; the bell. Rocks ahead, Cap&apos;n! There&apos;s no lighthouse here! ROCKS AHEAD! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
*Step back. Beast seems to know what he&apos;s doing.*
Well. School&apos;s out, I dare say...
*Alexandar eyes the totem apathetically, then waves you off without a word. He doesn&apos;t see your fists tighten; he doesn&apos;t see your jaw clench.*
They&apos;ll need to do even better than that.
I&apos;m glad too.
Invalid Combination
Long story. Maybe I&apos;ll tell you about it in the Joy. Away from interested parties.
*Tell him you don&apos;t need a why.*
Dark Pearl
*Say you&apos;re sorry, but you haven&apos;t seen it.*
We disembark soon. I&apos;ll set out first and see what information I might find to ease your journey.
I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; the Red Prince! The All-Conqueror. The World-Tamer. The Spouse of the Sun.
Ah. Yes. Well... good to hear.
You&apos;ll die there like the others, and in dyin&apos; you&apos;ll ssserve the King. Perhapsss we&apos;ll follow on your coat-tails, and &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;shall have the reward for Alexandar&apos;s head.
An elf collects the wisdom of the ages...
*A vision of her anger floats before you - the tigers of the forest lying lifeless in the fog, and she the last remaining spirit. But she has made a deal - she has sold herself to the God King...*
Grruuurrggh.
The very root required for the ritual of the Vision Serpent...
*The Meistr&apos;s cry cuts through the haze. You look up just in time to see what steps out of the shadows.*
*Inform him you tried to help the fugitive, but that the Magisters killed him.*
Cold-crawler Voidwoken
*Hold up a hand. Surely you can use &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;power for yourself.*
*Snort.* Career prospects? Look around you - that ship has sailed, and it threw me overboard.
*Take your enthusiastic leave.*
...&lt;i&gt;No. &lt;/i&gt;This thing was birthed from a wicked era. What would Lucian say, seeing me confront one evil with another...?
*The spirit of the witch remains unmoved on the floor. The spectral flames continue their danse macabre upon her form.*
Alexandar didn&apos;t survive long.
Regardless, you cannot spontaneously learn the skills you need. They must be taught by powerful Sourcerers, but it seems the Seekers are fresh out.
&lt;i&gt;Another &lt;/i&gt;bowl? Normally, I&apos;d decline, but I do so hope to learn something interesting from the cuisine in this place. The cook&apos;s reputation really does precede her.
*She looks up and down the length of your body.*
[This document contains the details of one Karon.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... Seriously, do NOT leave him unattended. The danger is immense. They didn&apos;t call him &apos;The Mistake&apos; for nothing, you know. He can control MASSIVE amounts of Source if given the opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I shudder to even THINK of what happened last time he was in full control of his powers...
We get out of this thing alive, there&apos;ll be plenty more where that came from.
The decision is yours, Godwoken - but I&apos;ll not wait here for you to make it.
...even &lt;i&gt;if &lt;/i&gt;the dragonkin has taken on such a curious and hideous shape. Still, the tongue lies not!
The Bishop&apos;s much taller than I had imagined from the paintings. And the Hammer is so much &lt;i&gt;younger...&lt;/i&gt;
Ho there, hopeful. I belong to Tir-Cendelius. To whom are you sworn?
Countryside Indoors 01
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;BRIGHT FEATHER&lt;/b&gt;.*
Succumbing to this temptation is a dangerous path. Please, think of the rest of us.
A Godwoken. I should have known.
So... Alexandar must be after the Council. Someone should see that he never steps foot in there - he&apos;s done enough damage as it is.
Paladin Loremaster
Golden Rope
*Change tack: move your thumb over one of his eyes and start to apply pressure.*
Take a seat, &lt;i&gt;rava&lt;/i&gt;, make yourself at home. Give me a moment to clear my throat, and... LISTEN.
*Narrow your eyes and say you couldn&apos;t allow this travesty of justice to continue.*
Onwards!
Good grief. Talk about bad news.
I took the God King&apos;s Covenant. It is time to take back what was stolen from us.
