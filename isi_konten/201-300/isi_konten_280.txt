I grow cold now, even thinking about it. It was not a dream, Godwoken. It was a threat; a promise from our enemy - the enemy you and you alone can stop.
You buggies are lucky you didn&apos;t hurt my boy.
If you must speak with me, you may come to my office.
*Keep the sword.*
And? Have you anything to report?
Pilgrim Hopeful
Aye. The kingdom has a chance, at least.
This is not a game, prisoner. Back to your cell!

The Doctor is in. He will see you now.

I&apos;m sick with worry. Completely sick. And no-one in this damn camp will lift a finger to help me find her.
Poisoned Roasted Pork
I warned you already - keep away from here.
Rhalic promises more than this world. But I&apos;m not sure the next is an improvement...
Trusting a pup to do a hound&apos;s work? It seems foolish, but very well; mark the location thus. And do not disappoint us.
Farmer&apos;s Daughter
The ability to see into another world. What an amazing gift!
*Mordus? Inform him that Mordus has been... dealt with.*
Good. We don&apos;t need anyone but each other.
I know you. Or... I&apos;ve heard of you. I&apos;m one of Lohar&apos;s. And you did us quite a good turn back in Driftwood. I thank you.
The Thieves&apos; Guild? The &lt;i&gt;secret &lt;/i&gt;Thieves&apos; Guild? If I told ya, it wouldn&apos;t be a secret no more! Gotta preserve the mystery, don&apos;t I? Also if I&apos;m honest I don&apos;t know where it is. I don&apos;t know &lt;i&gt;everything,&lt;/i&gt; do I?
A throwback to a more civilised time. Not that I remember such a time...
*Mordus. Where&apos;s he gone? What&apos;s he up to?*
Your gift buys my silence. Continue on your way.
Unusual Platemail Helmet
...
Anyone who takes me for such a fool deserves to die!
Good boots are a hunter&apos;s boon, as vital for fleeing an ogre as they are to kicking in a crocodile&apos;s teeth.
*Ask if she&apos;s certain that rounding up Sourcerers in Fort Joy will protect anyone.*
*Agree, you&apos;re enjoying your time on the road.*
Yet another gem of insight! My thanks! Now, just a couple more:&lt;br&gt;
Oh...
Blocks vision.
The Nameless Isle
Never say never though.
It is nothing! Many fragments swirl on my shore. See what I gather...
Please, good elf. Set me free...

A breakout!
Spirit of the Finesse Master
*The Scions of our people? Say you don&apos;t understand what she&apos;s talking about.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll do Amadia&apos;s bidding.*
Quite the crowd...
*The poster flutters lightly in the breeze.*
Hehehe... it&apos;s all just a DAMN JOKE!
I have books, though I hate to part with them. And you... hopefully you have something &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; want.
*Stare at the ground, embarrassed. You had quite forgotten about that.*
Open your eyes, stick bug. Time to die.
Without you, we&apos;d be dead on that beach. My thanks, Sebille.

*Take the glass and toast. &apos;To us.&apos;*
*Suffocating in his sleep, he bucks against you.*
The Eternals returned to the world. In the eyes of the God King, Fane was redeemed. He returned to his studies.
I left the egg in the dream.

*Tell her she&apos;s beautiful... but you can&apos;t do it.*
Then you&apos;ll know - no-one enters the tomb. And for that, Arhu must die.

*The hen gives you a panicked nod.*
*Petrified, from head to toe - a most unpleasant curse.*
Spawn bone totems near every enemy in the area. Bone totems have ranged attacks that deal physical damage.
We came to a large chamber filled with levers... and hostile Source puppets.
&lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;.
DEAD! Rot take him. Buzzards use him for a latrine.
*Slap him in the face. He needs to get up, &lt;i&gt;now!*&lt;/i&gt;
I am your god, and I &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;have your worship.
I must sound the alarm!
Hmm. I keep this conversation to myself. But my eye is upon you.
Closed
*Noting that being a head on a stick hasn&apos;t done much for his personality, take your leave.*
We found gloves that may have belonged to Gareth&apos;s parents&apos; killer.
Doom-hand!
The Source amulet is fully charged. We should return to Sanders.
Left Gui
His run-in with his daughter set Fane on a new path.
Huh? Sourcerer? Maybe not...
Campfire
Sure I did. I lay may trust where I shouldn&apos;t&apos;a. Won&apos;t happen again.
I... I need help. Someone helps me out. But... they are gone.
You still hanging around? And here&apos;s me thinking you were looking for adventure.
*Say you can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;promise&lt;/i&gt; him exactly, but you&apos;ll keep his request in mind.*
*Say you&apos;d like to discuss his missing supplies.*

You&apos;ll regret crossing Murina the Brave!
Knockout Arrow
This way&apos;s off limits.
Free... free me. Let me live again...
Stained Shirt
There is no such thing as a wrongly killed Sourcerer. Regardless of the disappearances, he was a danger to this town.
The dead have come. Attack!
The Shadow Prince sent me after the Black Ring leader the Sallow Man. I can use Sallow&apos;s magic mirrors to locate Sadha.
There are more Magisters where these came from. Let&apos;s finish them off. Then we&apos;ll talk.

Well, don&apos;t you look like hell! Swallowed something that doesn&apos;t agree with you? Tell me - was it a demon&apos;s nice, big -
Decaying Touch Scroll
Hah. No reason. Settle in, eh? A Magister&apos;ll come find you when they&apos;re ready for you. Could be awhile, though. High Priest is up to his hood in sinners these days.
*One cult leader  - the Outlaw Empress - was assassinated by the House of Shadow for heresy. Afterwards, the symbols faded into obscurity.*

Intelligence Brief
My poor love. He needs moment to himself - and who wouldn&apos;t. Today should&apos;ve been so different...
*Tell him you have, but shackling you won&apos;t keep them at bay.*
I&apos;d rather it didn&apos;t have to be this way... but that&apos;s just how the dice rolled. In another life, we could have succeeded together. Not this one.
Baggy Trousers
Most don&apos;t see what&apos;s coming. Can&apos;t see what&apos;s ahead. Can&apos;t... can&apos;t keep my mind straight...

I give you something, too. A thanks.

*The warg whimpers as the blade slides free... then slowly, carefully, releases your arm...*
*You hear a noise - a chant? A hymn? - as somber as thunder and as profound as a funeral dirge. It is first a chorus, and then a single voice, one you know all too well.*
*Decline to answer.*
*She&apos;s probably right. You quickly slice through her restraints.*
Next thing I know my best mate&apos;s buried his dagger in my gut, and there&apos;s Voidwoken everywhere you look.
You should be up there *wheeze* dying for our Lord!
*Your mind hungers, but your body is already glutted with Source. You are too full to feast.*
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her it&apos;s the corpses - blood roses only grow in soil rich with corpses.*
Go tell Magister Reimond or Magister Julian immediately! They&apos;ll raise the alert. Go! &lt;i&gt;Now!&lt;/i&gt;

You think yourself more &lt;b&gt;powerful &lt;/b&gt;than I? &lt;i&gt;Prove it.&lt;/i&gt;
There must be a nugget of wisdom somewhere in these dusty books.
You get immunity to water, but lowered resistance to fire. You bleed ice.
Yeah. Yeah, guess you&apos;re right.
[SEBILLE] *Say she sure did. But then again: so do you.*
We are the beginning and the end... We will return...
*Meet her lips.*
*She releases you and grins, running tongue over teeth.*
*The elderly woman pats the pilgrim on the shoulder and hands him a steaming bowl. A smile creases her face when she sees you waiting.*
*What&apos;s going on? Is she truly &lt;i&gt;afraid?*&lt;/i&gt;
Smart of you to stay out of business that ain&apos;t yours. Keep that up and you may survive long enough to get out of here.
*Apologise. He was right; you have a responsibility.*
You have my thanks for giving them hope, but I fear for their future. They cannot escape these swamps - they do not have the strength.
I don&apos;t know what yow be but yow ain&apos;t Black Ring. &lt;i&gt;So rejoice, I bring yow death..&lt;/i&gt;
Does it matter? They won&apos;t stop. Not &apos;til they&apos;re all dead. You can be &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;of that.

Nnnn?
I should neutralise this thing before it does damage.
The dwarven Godwoken returned to the kingdom, and assumed the dead queen&apos;s throne.
I hear that a certain Magister Bellworth has expired. Quite fortunate for those who wouldn&apos;t appreciate her &lt;i&gt;meddling &lt;/i&gt;in their affairs, don&apos;t you think?
[OUTLAW] *Tell him you&apos;re going to loot the chest, and you&apos;d appreciate if he looked the other way.*
Voidwoken Spike
The Godwoken surrendered Divinity. Lucian used the Source of the world to seal the Veil and banish the Void. Lucian will reign over a Source-free world.
*Ask about the first variety.*
I should certainly &lt;i&gt;hope &lt;/i&gt;so, or my life&apos;s workAWK has been for naught!
*Remark that death must have confused the spirit - this Paladin didn&apos;t kill him. It was another - one who was slain by a Magister in return.*
&lt;i&gt;...I&apos;LL KILL YOUR SHINING LIGHTS!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you&apos;ll go where you please, and she&apos;d do well to stay out of your way.*
*Say her sister with the Seekers was doing as well as could be expected when last you saw her.*
*An uncertain smile spreads across her lips and she starts to laugh. But the laugh becomes a rictus grin of terror, and she screams - *

Of course you do. What greater power could there be than knowledge?
Just destroy the pillars.
Despite their condition, there is some demand for Void-tainted fish in the city of Arx.
The dwarven people deserve answers. They deserve apologies. They deserve to walk the streets and sing their songs without fearing to offend their sovereign.
