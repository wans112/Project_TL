*Terror grips the spirit as oblivion dawns upon it. A lifetime of love and laughter, of hopes and dreams, of secrets and lies, of courage and fear... vanishes in an instant.*
We don&apos;t want to hurt ya, Marla.
You must be kidding. What kind of cheapskate are you?
We didn&apos;t find Lagan&apos;s wedding ring.
*The boy shakes his head in denial, then beams like the summer sun. Your heart stirs at the sight of an innocent child confined to a cage.*
*Growl that that&apos;s a lot of bluster to say &apos;I need your help&apos;.*
Greetings once more.
You could be important, b-but there&apos;s no way to be certain until we&apos;ve left this blasted island behind us.
Muddy Malachite
*The spirit&apos;s grin lingers as the spectral flames around him fade. Skin reforms around his skull. He is a handsome man with gentle eyes. He waves and vanishes.*
*You&apos;re shrinking, shrinking back, back to the safe and the dark, back behind where Lohse lives... for now.*
Yes, yes, do feel free to call.
Muzzle that thing, would you? And perhaps muzzle yourself while you&apos;re at it...
Indeed, the Magisters have even taken Braccus&apos;s worst tools. First the purging wands, and now those Shriekers...
*Remark that their definition of &apos;in charge&apos; may be different to yours. Ask what else is going on in the world.*
*Take your leave.*
Saheila says that you shall be the new Mother, Scion. We have hope now.
*You widen your eyes, striving to see further but a stinging slap drags you back to reality. Rhalic stands before you, gimlet eyes hard now. He slaps you again. Harder.*
&apos;ullo, lizard lady!
You honour our ritual, but not our lives. For shame. But you must still fight for all elves. Go to the Nameless Isle. The Mother Tree needs you.
Static Cloud Pit
Summon a Bone Crusher.
There&apos;s a way to move this ship on board; I&apos;m sure of it.
Movement: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
Y&apos;hear that, Fara? You got to cut that out! What&apos;s happened to ya?
Elementals... a-alright, but there&apos;s not many to choose from...
*The Silent Monk leans from one foot to the other. He seems eager to move.*
*Sob*
Indeed, great prince! But... but...
*Blink. Does she have any eggs to spare?*
I&apos;d be inclined to agree - if I wasn&apos;t so certain I&apos;m right to regard her higher than any ambition.
*The carving is covered in strange glyphs that feel oddly familiar. They surround a gently-glowing stone that makes you think of the night sky rolled into a ball.*
Brother, no!
*Look for the materials you need to complete the ritual.*
*Say you have no clue what&apos;s going on much of the time and the game&apos;s elements are unclear.*
Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Something isn&apos;t right. I need to &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt;. Move!
*Back away slowly towards the door.*
A Stockpile of Trouble
*Say you are the Spouse of the Sun. Say it proudly.*
Take the deal or leave it.
*Tell her that you don&apos;t have any Soul Jars.*
You may.
*Begin trade.*
City Guard Archmage
Can be used to create a random Earth Spell scroll...
*Her whole body tenses; her hands  clench into fists and her voice sharpens into a hoarse snarl.*
Curious how you have the nerve to seek my help, after you showed so little interest in assisting me with my own little matter previously...
Queen Justinia&apos;s advisor Isbeil is a Black Ring agent. The God King pulls the strings.
Your past is history. All that matters is the present. A Sourcerer in a land ravaged by Source, you&apos;re the problem and the Divine Order has the solution.
Tell &apos;em I sent you and they&apos;ll let you know what they&apos;ve found. Truth is, they might be glad to see you. Reckon a Sourcerer will have better luck finding one of their own.
Rooster
[1] makes you farsighted, causing your ranged attacks to be precise at long distances, but miss frequently if your target is close.
Alright beautiful, you&apos;ll have your chance. But I&apos;m escaping this hell one way or another, and Maxos himself couldn&apos;t save you if you do wrong by us.
Arx City Guide - Volume Three
Indeed. And your presence is... most unwelcome.
Despair, kin, despair. The Scion Sebille betrays us.
[ELF] *Note that he still speaks as elves do.*
Waypoint Travel
Decrepit Hatch
That seems to be the plan.
*Say you&apos;ll trade it for his enchanted clothes.*
A long sword that exudes command from its gilt-edged hilt to the tip of the tapered blade.
Instantly kill target below [1]% Vitality.[2][3]
Call me a fool, or a tyrant. Call me whatever you want. But I was still &lt;i&gt;there. I was there. &lt;/i&gt;I lived reality, while you were playing &lt;i&gt;games.&lt;/i&gt;
Not right now.
*For just a moment her eyes soften as she looks at you.*
The Tongue of Flame
*As you suck the smoke deep into your lungs, your vision starts to swim and cloud. There is an intense pounding in your head and you can feel the world fading.*
Headwear moulded from dappled, bark-tanned hide. Three words are engraved inside: &apos;Unity is Strength.&apos;
You are not &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; King! &lt;i&gt;I will not comply!&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;Squirrels alone shall reap the Great Acorn&apos;s blessings,&apos; they said. &apos;It&apos;s unnatural to associate with other species,&apos; they said.
Most intriguing. Your knowledge of the Source already exceeds my expectations...
*Over and back. Back and over, your palms slick on the smooth metal. As a bead of sweat drips from your forehead, the sixth tumbler falls.*
Saheila never trusted the new Divine. She began to search for an alternative plane - a new world where the elves could start again.
We destroyed the Deathfog machine. Arx was spared.
The new leadership ought to learn to respect its veterans - we&apos;re the ones who uphold the rule of law, not white ponces like Reimond and Jonathan...
Gheist
Assassin Looter
Pillar
I&apos;ve seen the damage Voidwoken have done... however they might have been wronged, it doesn&apos;t justify that. They must be stopped.
Once I&apos;ve talked to Stingtail.
We kept the egg. Some day, perhaps, a phoenix may hatch from it.
*Your eyes close. Death&apos;s shadows lift; rain becomes sun. Whatever fear this graveyard provoked is now bathed in brilliant light.*
Collar
Locker
Gold
Deal with Gratiana&apos;s Soul Jar.
*She gives you a searching look.*
*Her diplomatic training is good - trust no-one, and do not believe even the evidence of your own eyes. She increases the bombardment - random snatches of life pass before you, faster and faster.*
in service of the King,
Of course &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; could give it the distinction of class!&lt;br&gt;
Look. Do not touch. Not until you fatten my purse.
Oh yes, an exceptionally common, but exceptionally valuable commodity. A face.
Do return, should you find it necessary.
*Pause for a moment. Wonder what he meant by that.*
Ask away, Shield.
*Smile lazily and run your fingers along his cheekbone. That was amazing.*
He needs my soul. He needs you to do this wicked work for him.
The Bouncer
Not a step closer!
Best you leave the building, stranger. We have Sourcerer trouble. We&apos;re trying to talk her down without a fight. It&apos;s not going well.
All this strife can&apos;t last. Either way, Arx is worth fighting for - I just have to get Farro to see that.
*Weapons, he says? Ask him if these weapons are still here.*
Karon cannot... no... NO!
*Suddenly, your spirit shrinks away in terror. The thing looms; your hands are suddenly desperate to rip the young elf apart. You want her skin under your nails, her blood in your mouth.*
Cake
Do not worry about before. You are not yourself. I see that.
Good of you to help her out. She needs all the friends she can get. All Sourcerers do, these days.
*Tell her to ask away.*
Identifying Glass
We should probably clear a path for Almira and Mihaly.
Cave b-b-bird. It&apos;s dangerous! Hunts without moving. B-b-beware.
*Ask him to tell you more about his need to find a Dreamer.*
How strange, to walk a dream within a nightmare. Yet every spirit bound to the Devourer is now free.&lt;br&gt;
This heap of flesh and bone was just another lizard. The world won&apos;t mourn her long.
Wise, perhaps. Its effects seem to be stronger to the north; I&apos;d start looking there.
*Sink to one knee to retrieve the robe.*
*Beast&apos;s voice falters, unnerved by what he sees next.*
*He laughs, shaking his head and pointing at his ears.*
Of course there&apos;s... No, but never mind that now.
Applies Fortified, Cleanses Stun and Petrified.
Yeesh. That&apos;s one &apos;a those lizard scars, right? You alright though? Those bastards still getting you down?
Thinning the Herd
*Ponder his response. He has friends, yes? Family? It would be a shame if something happened to them...*
*Ask if the temple held.*
*Note that giving up one&apos;s Source renders one a Silent Monk. A husk of oneself. A non-being.*
*Say that in the spirit of a fresh start, you should admit to her you&apos;re actually an undead.*
*The ensuing silence lasts for several seconds until she picks up the melody once again and turns away.*
Oh, it&apos;s been quite a day. One moment, my flesh was flaming with cursed fire. The next, a stranger came along and eased my pain!
*The ghostly dwarf ignores you, but the word &apos;Mordus&apos; forms soundlessly upon his lips.*
*You are the Shadow Prince, master of the House of Shadows. A born rascal, you have spent many a long year honing your abilities - you have rare skill with a knife in your hand, and you have taken that skill to heart.*
Ain&apos;t none of your business why I&apos;m still here.
*Cough...* Grbbt.
Can we just skip to the part where I reassure you and you shut up?
Sebille, sh&apos;ialyinou. Sebille, na charlen de&apos;vot.
We&apos;ll see how bloodied you&apos;re willing to get to pluck the one rose lost in a forest of daggers.
*Smile, and say you&apos;re as innocent as a spring flower.*
*Kill her.*
Lookie here!
*A single name throbs across your brain. Verdas. Verdas. Verdas. He must escape. He cannot die here. He &lt;i&gt;cannot.*&lt;/i&gt;
Vulture Armour Set
You&apos;re either very lucky, or else you&apos;re a sharper mind than you look. Let&apos;s put you to the test.
*Move to kiss him.*
*He considers you for a moment.*
*Her body is smooth and soft, flesh dipping generously beneath your hands. You could take handful after handful of her and never have enough.*
I played my part &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; as written. I was taught to have no regrets. &lt;i&gt;And none do I have.&lt;/i&gt;
Reinforced Crate
We fought Windego.
I hold your blood, debtor. I&apos;LL TAKE YOUR HEART!
*Say that you&apos;re ready to begin.*
Nasty stuff...
*Tell the cat that its loyalty is admirable, but loyalty alone won&apos;t help its mistress.*
Ungh... I feel him in my head. In my soul. He&apos;s... he&apos;s getting stronger!
There&apos;s a cellar under the Black Bull tavern. We can mention Blaithin to the guard at the stairs.
*An elf in tattered red robes shifts through pages of handwritten notes spread across the table.*
*Beast chuckles as your forehead crinkles in confusion.*
Nothing special, just the worn shoes of a regular citizen.
Is there a difference between right and wrong? The truth is that there is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; - only action and consequence. Oh &lt;i&gt;ho! &lt;/i&gt;I got you there!
*Tell her it was the best option for the realm.*
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present to you the Lone Wolf, the Silver Claw: Ifan.
Bad smell! Deadness and anger. BAD!
Purple Noxious Bulb
*Tell him to relax. You didn&apos;t mean any harm.*
You look mighty familiar. You know something about a recent murder, I presume.
I just, it&apos;s just that I wanted, it&apos;s that all my things were, it&apos;s just that they took everything, it&apos;s just that it was mine...
*Insist she drop her weapon and set this Sourcerer free.*
*The old king Braccus watches the horizon.*
