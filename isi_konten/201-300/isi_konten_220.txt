I have told you before the Void is stronger than ever. But so are you.
*Call to him: Is he alright?*
We escaped Fort Joy, leaving Amyro to his fate.
*Say you&apos;ll take your chances.*
Mmhmm! I should think so. If not I&apos;ll... I dunno, smite you, or whatever.
A shrine, by the looks of it...
*You wipe your face with your forearm. The smell will stay on you for days. The things you do for queen and country... maybe more than they deserve.*
I learned that Dallis and Vredeman indeed sought to access the Tomb of Lucian, and set off in pursuit. Whatever they intended to do, I had to stop them. So much still remained a mystery to me, but I felt that if I could confront Dallis, then I would finally have answers, and could put an end to all of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am about to cross the final threshold, and meet my destiny.
Well, bugger me with a bull&apos;s horn!
*Say the creature you met matches her description.*
Feed Rory while Betty talks to him.
[HERO] *Say you have wandered the land high and low, asking after her. You come bearing word of her vital weakness.*
My loved ones may be gone, the Seven may be corrupt, but I remain. The last true Eternal must survive.
*Paladin Willym nods his thanks to you. And with a last sorrow-filled glance at the house, Paladin Jhad turns to follow his companion away.*
We made our way into the consulate.
*Note the bulge at his ankle. Take out a penny. Accidentally drop it at his feet. Bend to pick it up, and clumsily stand on his toes. While he&apos;s distracted, steal the purse from his sock.*
It was only a matter of time before the Order would come for us, she said. The scouts talked of living weapons, nailed to crosses. Of blank-faced wizards - an entire force of them.
The password for the master cabin is &apos;Fortitude&apos;.
*Say you&apos;ve heard that Sourcerers are permitted to leave once they&apos;re cured.*
I... I told Conway. I felt it, you know. The cold of it. When he... passed. My bones knew.
C&apos;mon, c&apos;mon, let&apos;s keep moving!
Dungeon - Empty Room (Long)
*Tell her you&apos;re looking for Dallis. Has she seen the Hammer here at the Cathedral?*
Poison Arrows
*Ifan&apos;s spirit stares at you, seemingly &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; you. There is neither affection nor blame in his expression.*
Food baby.
[SCHOLAR] *There&apos;s something off about this toy. Reach forward and grab hold of it.*
Human Mite Attack
*The Djinn hisses slowly through its teeth.*
Is that so? Well why don&apos;t you give it over? Might be you&apos;ll walk out of this swamp after all.
Sleeping
No surprise there.
Rose Alabaster
Labs Gear
*Compliment him on his impersonation.*
Please, help me. I don&apos;t want to die. I don&apos;t want them to take me!
Let me show you what happens when you attack the wrong people...
The elves were decimated, their forests felled, their memories lost.
*Even if it was so very dangerous.*
*A human spirit slips from the ruins of the jar. Decked in necromancer robes she turns to you, bows, and starts to fade away to nothing.*
*Tell her she looks worried.*
*Tell him there&apos;ll be time to mourn later; more death is on the way.*
Are my eyes fooling me?
No tellin&apos; what that cargo is. But it means trouble.
*Promise you won&apos;t breathe a word of it to anyone.*
*Suspicious, she searches your face for a hint that you&apos;re lying. Doesn&apos;t find one. Behind the cool exterior, you can tell she&apos;s shocked.*
*Shoot her a curious glance. An elf is after her body?*
Eeuurgh... I... know it&apos;s you. You&apos;re like me. See?
*Amadia, huh? Who is that?*
Fortified Boots
You want an engraved invitation every time? You know the way in...
*Tell her no. You&apos;ll push on without her.*
&lt;i&gt;Of course.&lt;/i&gt;
There&apos;s been an assault reported in the area. Do you know anything about it?
I can&apos;t quite fathom why you denied my knowledge of the Source, but I sense there is a certain wisdom in your decision.
*Tell him you have a similar goal. Perhaps you can help each other.*
*Tell her you mean her no harm.*
*Tell them their charity is all well and good, but they&apos;ve done terribly wrong. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;seek to reverse the damage - if they can help you further, they should.*
Yes, we certainly had better, but the ship won&apos;t move.
*You are thrust out of the spirit&apos;s memories and back into your own sovereign mind. You see the spirit of the dwarven battlemage before you, eyes downcast now.*
*Ask if it was Dallis who invented these godsawful collars.*
*Try to get his attention.*
*Jaw clenched, maintain a stony silence.*
A flippant tongue and a fleeting life, is that all you&apos;ve left?
You pay for your crimes!
I don&apos;t believe you. I see guilt in your eyes.
Dwarven Mask of the Shapeshifter
*She turns back to her drink.*
Dazed
*Reach over and try to wave your hand through her face.*
Our defences are breached. Must I kill you now? It would pain me.
*Take your leave.*
*Ignore the door and take your leave.*
Bloom of Mettle
The Eternals reclaimed the world.
Not I! They are older than Braccus: ancient relics from a bygone age. He uncovered them - I merely... encouraged him to explore their promise.
...
I found out who abducted me; who delivered me to the Master...
Challenge the Great Guardian.
Really? Didn&apos;t even sound like you&apos;d ever heard of the guild a minute ago. I might be a kid, but I&apos;m no dummy.
Alright... just don&apos;t take long.
What a damned nuisance these assassins are. It&apos;s their frightful manners I mind the most, really.
I wonder if my memories are out there, swimming around in some elf&apos;s mind. I shiver at the thought.
Level [1]: +[2]% to all damage when attacking from high ground. Note that this bonus is applied after all other bonuses have been applied.
Our bargain is almost complete. I will teach you what I know. You will be bonded to the Source. You will channel it in great volume.
[VILLAIN] *Note that this Pearst fellow had a large wound in his back - he must have died while fleeing like a coward...*
What a whopper! This would fetch a pretty penny from the more upmarket traders in the Elven garment district.
And if you&apos;re loyal to the Order, you know I&apos;m right!
Venture deeper into the consulate.
It is immortality you desire. As do we all. It&apos;s not something I can give - but I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; give you the breath of life.
Most artefacts like this mask are long lost, but you craft them anew.
Greater good, schmeater good. I didn&apos;t survive the Magisters, crazy gods, God King, and whackjob Eternals not to enjoy myself thereafter!
*Ifan&apos;s eyes blaze with rage, and his fists are clenched so tightly the knuckles are white.*
No, we understand not!
*Purr.*
Load Campaign
You will not be there long, I assure you. There is only so much you can glean from a twisted mind.
*&apos;I wait for her. When she is ready. When she lives a full life. When the forests return to us.&apos;*
So... there&apos;s some things ya oughta know about me. I&apos;m sorta kinda royalty. I mean, never wore a crown. Not with diamonds in it, anyway. Once stuck a wreath on my head and... oh, sorry. Need to stop with that whole tangent thing.
Oops. I guess they don&apos;t like the cold.
*Lie. Tell him the queen still lives.*
It... it has been unlike anything I ever imagined.
*You behold a face you&apos;ve seen before. Soul-sickness incarnate, the rotten flesh of the world&apos;s most shameful desires, an all-knowing affliction. This is the God King&apos;s pallid envoy, walking the world...*
I thought&apos;s much. No-one cares. *Sigh.* No-one cares but elves and bears.
Look away from the past and into the future. There is so much work left to do.
Are you... an elf? WOW! I want to be an elf when I grow up. But without the scar.
The Ancient Empire had weathered the upheaval, and the heads of the its houses gathered to choose a leader for this brave new world. The House of Shadows did not attend, but curiously their chosen candidate still came out on top.
So, seen all the magnificent sights of Fort Joy already? I&apos;ve just got a small &lt;i&gt;errand&lt;/i&gt; to run here, but then I&apos;ll be looking to get the hell out of this place while I&apos;ve still got a neck to collar. Want to team up?

*The blazing blue flame seems to singe your finger the moment you touch the statue. Somehow, though, the bone remains unblemished.*
I would not trade a Godwoken soul for a thousand others. No, bones. You are mine. And now, I &lt;i&gt;feast&lt;/i&gt;.
Call me Zaleskar. Nowt else concerning me is yours to ask. My business is my own, and none of it yours.
*Shrug and say you wanted to see what would happen.*
*Say you are strong of heart and mind. Betrayal is for the weak.*
But what about everyone else, Trice? We can&apos;t just leave &apos;em to die! Please, can&apos;t you do something?
Poor wretches, they didn&apos;t stand a chance...
But now that he&apos;s as rotten as we, I can finally enjoy the moonlight again! Oh to walk with the wolves by my side once more...
You deluded little runt. I was crafting a weapon to kill your &apos;Gods&apos; while you were sitting out the war in your crypt. And I kept it close. I hid it in these very caves.
No! Necromancy is an... unsavoury practice. Not something to be trifled with lightly. This is but a cunning illusion of my own creation, nothing more.
Onward, pray! We haven&apos;t the time for idle chitchat!
Perhaps &lt;i&gt;they &lt;/i&gt;intend to flay the godliness from you? No matter - given your pathetic state, it is mine to collect at my leisure.
Had they decided to live in peace with the mortals of Rivellon, maybe we could have saved them.
*Tell His Honour hope can hang. You &lt;i&gt;shall &lt;/i&gt;answer the riddle.*
*Ifan&apos;s lip curls and his eyes hold you in contempt. Then he turns away. The coiled spring snaps, and he pounces upon Lucian like savagery incarnate.*
*Tell her that you intend to craft the Swornbreaker yourself - you&apos;ll need the tablet back in order to do so.*
*Flutter your eyelashes and ask what time he gets off work later.*
*The stars swirl and move... and form a face - the face of an imp.*
Vial
*You turn and flee towards the library, to warn your tutors - but Lucian is too fast. He cuts you down. You&apos;re Candor the Godwoken, dead by the hand of the Divine.*
Not now. Escape this place. I know you can do it.
Fire Shield
Place makes a good base. And we got money now.
*With a nod to you, the beasts amble away.*
Peace Offering
*Tell her you did it before, when she turned against the elf Saheila - remember?*
If that&apos;s true, you&apos;re an even bigger sap than I thought. Feel free to fork over any &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;gold you might wanna put into my pipe.
[UNDEAD] *This truly is undeath worse than death. Ask who tormented them so.*
*She tosses her pack to you, harder than she needs to, and walks away from you backward, holding up both hands in a rude gesture.*
*The flaming hatchling bounces and cheeps out of sheer excitement.*
Because of that betrayal, you exist. Because of what was stolen from us, you exist. Because of the powers we lost, you exist. We will have them back.
*The creature wobbles with alarm, uttering a series of agitated gurgles.*
Lohse is dead. The music has fallen silent, never to be heard again.
Outcast Berserker
