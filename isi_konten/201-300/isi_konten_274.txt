You do not disappoint, my prince. You&apos;re every bit the royal they said you&apos;d be.
*Relent; tell her to go ahead.*
Subdue her, men! Quickly! If she casts Source, the Voidwoken will come! They&apos;ll end us all!
Go on then.
*Enter the portal.*
*Ignore your own nagging guilt and consume his Source.*
There are more Masters of the Source, more aspects of the Source to learn. The hunt continues...
Very well. I have your gold, regardless. Not to mention a strict no-refunds policy.
Shoot spores of corrosive acid, dealing [1].
I don&apos;t know that I have ever seen Lady Kemm with her husband. Unusual, I should say.
Hurry...
Handmade Shield
*As you approach, the Silent Monk puffs a bit of air from between her stitched lips. She seems agitated.*
Shield of a Devotee
Hmm...
*Change your mind and be on your way.*
And? Have you found them? Did you bring the Soul Jars?
*Sigh and hand him the will.*
*Remain calm. Tell him you&apos;ve come to ask him a question.*
*Say that you know what happened to the missing prisoners - they were taken so that their Source could be harvested.*
Go on. You may kneel before me!
Oh hullo there. A fine day it is. And the finest day for a wee saunter through the trees it is too. Not even any Voidwoken left to spoil it!
Okay...
We are connected now. You and I. You and all our kind.
Instruments
Take this, and buy passage on a boat that will take you far, far away, Godwoken.
Right here right now, I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be yours alone; &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to be yours alone.
Old Rabbit
An empty vial waiting to hold whatever wild concoction you can brew.
You&apos;re very kind. How about another one? Penny for a sick dog?
Yeah. Nah. Punch you later then.
That&apos;s all I know, I swear. That&apos;s how they got me. I didn&apos;t realise I was in danger until it was too late.
Justinia. Is... is she inside, then?
Yeah? Well I think you look just like my mum and she&apos;s DEAD! So what does that make you? DEAD LADY! I never wanted to play with you anyway.
*You&apos;d wink if you could, but you&apos;ll have to settle for an arrogant chuckle. That wasn&apos;t so hard, was it?*
The Empress saw I was truly faithful, but preaching a false prophet. She lead me to the Devourer, to the endless voice of the dragon!
Someone in Fort Joy must know of a way out.
*For a moment, Isbeil appears almost... relaxed. Her eyes flash blue; her face quivers.*
Some battles we can win, it seems, but some we cannot. These are dark days for Arx. For everyone.
Fine by me. I hope you weren&apos;t so closed-lipped to the Burnished One, though.
*Let him kiss you.*
Not for long! The Magisters have a boat close to here, see? &lt;i&gt;The Lady Vengeance&lt;/i&gt;. Good name, since my friends are gonna capture her and sail us far away from here.
I know better, but it don&apos;t matter. Ya ain&apos;t got no chance of provin&apos; much more than your own name, by the looks of ya.
New Human Male Player
I spent far too little time there. It was a strange place, but there was... peace. A peace I never knew before.
Now where&apos;d you get a thing like that, mate.
*Tell the Magister to call off the search - you found the real killer!*
*Concur - for now.*
[1] Damage
*Say you can tell she&apos;s upset. You&apos;d like a chance to comfort her, if you can.*
But our master does not care for the Magister lambs. It&apos;s you Godwoken that are the wolves, and it&apos;s time to put you down.
Right. Well, it makes no difference to the slaughtered.
*Tell Marg that you want to avail of the price you paid before: can&apos;t you have the same deal?*
*He seems on the verge of responding aggressively... but changes his mind and lowers his head in respect.*
Like this?
They couldn&apos;t handle m&apos;beauty, obviously.
Not too worse for wear, are you? So? How&apos;d it go?
Ah. Yes. Of course.
The great Sourcerer Ryker, a lone wolf known for his manipulation of the innocent dead, died by our visitor&apos;s hand, Your Majesty.
*Accept his thanks.*
Remember who&apos;s in charge here, boy!
*Ifan keeps your hand held tight in his own as you stride - one damned intimidating pair - to what awaits...*
*Take a closer look at the automaton.*
Braccus&apos;s whore. And more besides. She helped his rise to power, feeding him the Source of the innocent as she went.
Cold to the touch, this is the precious ring of the Shadow Prince.
*Return the object to your pack.*
*Say you understand his passion, but that right here right now you want him to be yours and yours alone.*
...Damian.
Tears of the Gods
*You try to hold your focus as the whispering echo fades, but the letters waver, contorting and merging until they&apos;re nothing but meaningless glyphs once more.*
*Look at the gruesome creature with suspicion, lowering yourself into a combat stance...*
*You feel hands reaching for you, grabbing you, and then there&apos;s only cold darkness. You step back, returning to your body in the cave.*

*Attack the creature. Lives are at stake.*
Yes! Atusa. She is a lizard, she is a Magister, but she is kind! She says there are many Magisters who do not agree with the Bishop. She says they bring us to safety.
&apos;Here lies Trie Keller.&lt;br&gt;Fell from a great height.&lt;br&gt;A loss keenly felt.&apos;
Urrggh... I&apos;d give up my &lt;i&gt;wings &lt;/i&gt;for a respite from this pestilence...
Companionway
The Magisters are dead? What, &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of them?!
You understand, then. Ashes and bone litter the island, but where death comes, life rises.
*Ifan beams at you, his blood-streaked face more jubilant than you&apos;ve ever seen it. He reaches out and pulls you into a bear hug, clapping you on the back.*
SAVE
Forget that! People are fast to abandon clan and kin in this place - they&apos;re a bunch of cowards. Not me though - I have a plan, but there&apos;s not much time...
It&apos;s taken its toll. They arrived wounded, but since their leader has disappeared into the swamps they are truly broken.
*Your fingers slip and the armour collapses together again with a wet crunch. Herman sways, eyes mad with pain.*
What were you thinking? You can&apos;t afford me.
A strange sort of pit. There must be a way to disarm it.
It&apos;s the right thing to do. You know it is. The sacrifice is worth the prize.
A black cat! Here kitty! Here kitty kitty!
*Tell her you ate the last remaining egg.*
Almost got me that time!

You must face the consequences!
We escaped from Reaper&apos;s Eye, and so too did Slane, free from Radeka&apos;s clutches.

Lohse&apos;s demon remains in place. How much longer can she remain in control?
*Hold up the six-sided gem and tell the door to open.*
*The spirit of the Defiler continues to fight on in vain.*
Zaleskar gave Ifan a powerful crossbow.
Turns out the tales are true. The Magisters dug deep, and returned these horrors to the surface.
*Take a deep breath and ask about the shard you found.*
[IFAN] *Say her complicity in the death of thousands earns her the Void. Consume her Source.*
We&apos;ll need a purging wand to defeat them.
Run! GO! I will find you! I&apos;ll be in...aaaaaaaahhhhh!
We&apos;ve collected the full armour set of the Devourer.
LEAVE!
Beehive
*Two candles glow with eerie, heatless light, unmelting black wax glistening in their glow.*
A gift for your loyalty. Let it be a reminder that greater rewards will come when you prove yourself worthy.
*Offer to help - if you can?*
Beer Barrel
You are the Champion of the Arena in Driftwood. Although a high honour in its own right, it is also a necessary stepping stone to becoming the One.
Hmmm. I wonder when this was imported. Must have been before the last war.
It&apos;s lovely to see you again. I&apos;d be devastated were you to, for example, &lt;i&gt;get lost.&lt;/i&gt;
*The squirrel reaches out and touches your ankle, sending a hot flush rippling through your body.*
*BOCK!*
*Consider her words. Perhaps she had the best interests of the people at heart.*
*He takes a deep breath, then lets it out again slowly.*
When we returned to his cage, Karon had vanished.
Mmm. Found the undead freak here already chained up by the Magisters. They say she&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;witch&lt;/i&gt;. I say...
*Exclaim that she learned the name of the demon! This is great news!*
Howling Amulet
*Wish him good luck with his investigation.*
The tigers fly, the leopards lie, and you... and you... Oh! But I know you, don&apos;t I? I have seen you in the night. A lone man in a wicked fog... Just a dream, of course. Just a dream.
It can not happen. It &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;not happen! Please, you must find them!
Lord Kemm did what he had to. The Black Ring cannot be allowed to get a hold in Arx.
The Magisters keep their list of rogue Sourcerers locked in the barracks&apos; cellar.
Please! PLEASE! Hnnngh. Come here!
*The innards fall to the floor, landing in a pool of dark bile. You&apos;d expect fish to smell, but these reek.*
Sanguinia Tell
A note written by the Undead librarian Eithne before she passed over to the other side.
*BOCK!*
GNRF!
Deathfog? Good thing I&apos;m immune. Still - this means trouble.
...the Ring... disband them...
Indeed I am. This cell feels like a tomb, but it&apos;s still better than a grave.
*Despite the overwhelming urge, say it is too dangerous. He is weak, yet he invites you to take from him!*
Keep him away from me! Help, somebody! *Gasp* &lt;i&gt;KEEP HIM AWAY!&lt;/i&gt;
*She freezes under your stare for a moment, then whirls and grabs you in a stranglehold. You feel the tip of a long needle being pushed a little ways into your neck.*
I see it. I see the Divine&apos;s essence shining from within you. You have walked the Path! You have overcome the challenge of Rivellon&apos;s greatest feat of engineering!
A trustworthy saviour and samaritan to those in need, you are beloved by many.
*Tell the truth; you got it from a fella who nicked it from Griff.*
*Say you came from a place not so far from here.*
*Raise the subject of the disappearances...*
Oh, well that&apos;s a deal I can get behind. Let&apos;s just pretend this conversation never happened, shall we?
... 2... 1... guess you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to disappear?
*Mari flashes a massive, horsey smile at you then winces, her left arm hanging limply at her side.*
*Crack your knuckles and say that you&apos;re prepared to defend your honour.*
Without Almira I might as well lay down and die.
New Dawn
*Ahem!* Hng, if you get me in trouble, you owe me BIG!
Ah...A-Almira? &apos;pologies mistress. I&apos;d never have dreamed of questioning any thrall of &lt;i&gt;yours&lt;/i&gt;.
*Suggest that maybe hiding might be the wiser course of action.*
*As the boat rocks downward, a prayer to Lucian you once heard passes through your mind:&lt;i&gt; &apos;The law of life from Divine within, save me from death and the shackles of sin.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
There was something in the water. A voice made of air that soothed my flooding lungs... There was sudden light, warmth - life.
Covered in fire. Even the stones are ablaze. Must be a lizard thing...
You prefer a fair but forgiving adventure that rewards clever thinking in and out of battle.

DeSelby&apos;s a traitor? No wonder I missed her in the fighting.
