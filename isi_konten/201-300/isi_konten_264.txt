It&apos;s alright... this is what we&apos;ve been looking for. The place where we can be together.
Spirit of Davrick Grigsby
That said, he did want to talk to me about the Red Princess: a chance I was deprived off when you so gracefully skewered his neck with your needle.
Maggot, I am no slave -
*She tilts her head ever so slightly, and looks at you almost... mockingly. You can&apos;t help but contemplate with both dread and delight the absolute darkness at the heart of her cat&apos;s eyes.*
Small Thunder Rune
Meaty Stew
By the Divine, haven&apos;t I. Back home again, or to somewhere totally new. Sun, wine, &lt;i&gt;freedom&lt;/i&gt;.
*She stares at you as if you&apos;re mad, but then it starts to work. Captivated by your cool regard, her breathing slows and her panic subsides. Job done.*
*The ghost seems despondent. Understandable, perhaps, given the circumstances...*
It seems the Seekers are without their leader. We should try to find Gareth in order to learn more about the group.
*Before you stands a shrine of a particularly strange design.*

Whaddya call a pile of kittens?

How your words darken the day! The mother of dragons... dead. Truly this world is coming to an end.
It was only a matter of time, she said, and I never doubted it. The scouts talked of living weapons, nailed to crosses. Of blank-faced wizards - an entire force of them. If we didn&apos;t come for the Order, the Magisters and Paladins... they would come for us.
[SCHOLAR] *Give a passionate and informed speech on how history proves time and again the regular necessity of harming others for the greater good. Cite Lucian in the Great War as proof.*

Well I&apos;m afraid that what you&apos;d &lt;i&gt;like &lt;/i&gt;isn&apos;t the deciding factor.
*Take the girl&apos;s hand in your own.*
Alexandar himself is Godwoken, but he hasn&apos;t risen yet - hasn&apos;t succeeded his father as the Divine. I wouldn&apos;t put it past him killing other Godwoken, to eliminate any competition...
Didn&apos;t you hear me? Stop it!
You &lt;i&gt;remember! &lt;/i&gt;My blind eyes will make you see!
*Keep up the charade. You have no intention of lying to Dallis. You&apos;ll tell her what you saw here!*
You couldn&apos;t know. &lt;i&gt;You weren&apos;t there &lt;/i&gt;when the portal opened and the Deathfog poured in. &lt;i&gt;You weren&apos;t there &lt;/i&gt;to see their skin burst, to see the blood-bubbles foam from their mouths.
*When the vial is full she takes out the knife. And the wound is already healed.*
*Punch him in the mouth. Things will go easier if he&apos;s unconscious.*

*Back away; you don&apos;t want to provoke the beast.*
Excellent! How fortuitous that we could come to an accord. Doubtless it will be beneficial to all parties concerned.

A job. A job for the queen. Now get your scraggy elven mug away from mine.
*The bloom opens before your eyes, resplendent and regal. It emits a sweet, subtle scent, like that of a rose, though more intoxicating.*
*Jahan stands back from her, his body tense. He stares into her eyes a long while, saying nothing.*
A small sheet of paper with exceedingly neat handwriting.
In this place? Good luck to you.
But... what makes me any better than them? Maybe there&apos;s another way...
Afrit&apos;s been howling at my side a long time, now. Good old boy appears anytime I use Source. You should have seen him rampage on the day the Magisters collared me!
Not bad, eh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Ask what&apos;s going on.*
You read my mind...
You runaway? Everyone here runaway, all run. All run from &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;...
*She gives you a look of the deepest, darkest contempt.*
Flame-dreamer
Broke?! BROKE?!
*A puppet stands motionless before you - just like the ones you saw animated by Toyseller Sanders...*
Riveted Helmet
*Say that you&apos;ve already tried - is there another way?*
But she could never be sure that the new Divine trusted her.

You are not worthy to know my saviour!
Battle the Voidwoken at the bridge.
Get away from me, Black Ring lackey.

Resurrect

Time you got what&apos;s coming to you!
[RED PRINCE] *Smile and say that when the Spouse of the Sun blushes, all that look upon him are incinerated.*

Dead Dwarven Warrior
I am no fool, thief.
I bet there&apos;s a pleased smile lurking in the shadows crossing your face. Yet you&apos;re too quick to act, too green still. Mastery was there for the taking, yet you refused it.
A demon&apos;s true name is its weakness, which is why it basks in being known by a thousand different aspects of its inmost self.
&lt;i&gt;Betray?&lt;/i&gt; I didn&apos;t betray the Order - I &lt;i&gt;liberated&lt;/i&gt; it!
The Sourcerer - he&apos;s back. And he&apos;s not alone!
By the Seven, these sacks weigh like lead! It&apos;s a disgrace I have to toil like this! I&apos;m a Magister, not a damn Silent Monk!
Small Frost Rune
Huh, should&apos;ve known it was a parlour gimmick.
*A few sharp tugs and you&apos;ve pulled a severed human hand loose, partially-pecked. You don&apos;t need to be a genius to surmise that Jimmy choked on his dinner...*
*You close your eyes and for a moment you&apos;re seeing through someone else&apos;s. You see a dungeon, a deck of cards in your hand, and a pair of skeletons before the vision passes.*
Okay, right, great. I&apos;ll go so. Cheers.
*About releasing the Deathfog...*
The thing is...
...but what about your companions? It seems to me that perhaps there&apos;s still more to be done. I hate to labour the point, but this is your last chance to tie off any loose ends.
*The brute&apos;s nostrils flare as you approach. He catches himself and turns his back.*
*Shake your head in bafflement. Why didn&apos;t the Seekers level with you about this?*
Search for the demon Adramahlihk.
I see I must repeat myself. Hands. Off.
You confuse frivolity with an unbridled lust for life. That&apos;s fine, I don&apos;t hold it against you.
*Lohse&apos;s shoulders slump. The weight she carries overwhelms her, yet she still finds the strength to reply to the demon that has for too long been a burden.*

More glorious than you could ever imagine. More glorious than I wish to recall here.
Crow
*He looks at you, eyebrows raised. Then he laughs.*
Only they know if they atone for their sins.
You have defeated your enemies, but there can be only One champion. Many may succeed, but only One may ascend.
It&apos;s disgusting, that&apos;s what it is.
*She turns toward Saheila.*
Magical Elven Lance
Someone sewed in a name label embroidered &apos;Precious&apos; - how, well, precious.
Medicinal Uses of Drudanae
[1] requested to go back to the lobby!
*Squeal.*
*Say you are. Let&apos;s do this.*
*She stares uncomprehendingly at your movements, slowly raising a bewildered gaze to meet your eyes. She &lt;i&gt;stares&lt;/i&gt;, and you feel yourself drawn into the mesmerising Source pools of her eyes.*
*The ink is absorbed into the parchment until it vanishes. Somewhere within the desk, a mechanism unlocks with a click.*

There&apos;s nothing inna chest! So don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest. DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
Grbbt
Arx thanks you, stranger! Your prowess on the field is already legendary. Be careful, or we&apos;ll claim you as our own!
*Open one eye and tell her this is silly.*
There. That wasn&apos;t so bad was it?
You two-legs light fires in the woods. You make noise and mess. Go and be with your own kind. Leave me alone.
*Tell him the Duke of Tarold said something similar, right before you fed him to his pet piglet.*
Voidwoken. Sabotage. Bad cake. You&apos;d think someone had it in for our little lady...
What have we here? You trying to buy me off? Well, good. Now, go on with you, before I think better of it.
She&apos;s holding court in the sewers, if you can believe it. Go to my wine cellar, pull out the vintage called &apos;Lulabelle&apos;. It will open the way for you.
&lt;i&gt;Saw? Nothing! Saw nothing. But smelled everything. Smelled life. Smelled death. Smelled it seeping out of the barrels. Death. Death sailing into the rocks!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you have more important matters to attend to.*
I&apos;ll wipe that grin off your ugly mug, mate. Learn you to mind your own beeswax...
Show Gareth Jonathan&apos;s ring.
Join the master at the temple of the false goddess, Zorl-Stissa. We cannot leave him waiting.
Your man with no name is on the isle with no name. Popular spot these days. Lots of my wolves prowling its beaches...
Roasted Pork Dish
You smell nice. Like Master Arhu. Master Arhu was gone but then came back. An&apos; I got m&apos;ball back! Smelly man threw&apos;t away! But then Master Arhu died. That&apos;s not good.
I... I do hope we&apos;ll see him soon. Sometimes I get such a dark feeling in my bones, like a sudden freeze, when I think about him...
I am your god! I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; have your worship!
