Brahmos fled his shadowy lizard pursuers, in the direction of a cemetery.
Still warm from the udder.
No. One moment. Please.
Oh, I really don&apos;t feel like chatting now. Why don&apos;t you go home to your wife and kids, maybe follow your grease trail back here another day.
*Ask him to tell you about his home plane&lt;i&gt;.*&lt;/i&gt;
I like that it stays where it is. Other remains don&apos;t always stay where I put them.
The fracturing of the Divine Order, the Voidwoken crisis, multiple attempts on his life... he&apos;s let none of it deter him. Now ascension is within sight, at last.
Maybe later.
As Source flooded Rivellon,
*Trace a finger along the intricate design of your slave scar.*
*It raises a handful of viscera to its mouth, then pauses, sensing your gaze.*
[DWARF] *You know the song, but can&apos;t remember the following line.*
[UNDEAD] *Exclaim that your numbed senses make it difficult to feel much of... anything.*
I take it from your corpse, thief.
Always &lt;i&gt;so nice &lt;/i&gt;to have friends in high places, and your new position is about as lofty as they come...
It is not devotion to Saheila. It is devotion to... all. To the world. She is very... special. She sees how we will survive. The Voidwoken. The dead Divine. She leads us back home.

The Undead Among Us&lt;br&gt;Author: Midym Hex&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter Seven - The Lich&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These manipulative creatures are unique among the undead, not because they may command Source - many rekindled souls draw from their own inner well, after all - but because it flows from an apparently everlasting wellspring into their bones and hollows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several manners of harvesting a Lich&apos;s supply of Source are known, though you must of course identify the creature as such before siphoning away its essence. You may recognise a Lich by its bizarrely venous glow and haughty presence; you may learn its name by reciting this simple chant:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&apos;In void you fell, and from void you come. Reveal your truth to me!&apos;
S... Sourcerer? You!
[BEAST] *Tell him you are sorry - but she had done too much harm. She had to perish.*
*Reply that Justinia is alive and well.*
[FANE] *Recall the feeling of waking up and draining a body of Source. Recall the rushing power that filled you. Unleash it!*
*Close your eyes and try to let the ambient sounds on the ship fade away.*
Any
*Shake your head and say that in the end, no-one is beyond redemption.*

Are you the one making a mess around here?
A troll must stand by his principles!
*Smile. Notice the way the clasps and buckles on her outfit press into her caramel skin. Tell her she has your attention.*
Gallows
Justice must be seen. It cannot take place in the shadows. Make your peace, Paladin.
But if I am to write a first-rate work, you must face some... difficult questions. Are you prepared to answer?
*The Magister squints at you. At length.*
Lucian the Divine himself paid us a visit. We feasted with him. He raised a toast to his old teachers...
We set sail from Reaper&apos;s Coast, leaving Captain Ablewether behind.
Starfish
*Zimski mutters to himself as he traces sigils in the dirt. He spies you and a shrewd look brightens his eyes. He stretches out a hand, showing you a solitary coin on his palm.*
*Sallow gives you a long look. The tendrils of his mind snap about yours, but they do not probe. With difficulty, he summons the power of his speech.*
*The spirit catches himself.*
[OUTLAW] *You cautiously sidle forward, but keep a hand on your blade. You won&apos;t be caught unawares.*
This trusty kitchen knife still has bits of potato skin clinging to its blade, yet it seems sharp enough to be put to other - non-kitchen - purposes.
Small ones, this time. Thank the gods.
*Her eyes dance all over you as she idly traces her collarbone with one taloned finger.*
Not always, my friend. And not this time. Come, release me. Untold power will be yours.
A fine day for it.
*Demand to know where Dallis is now.*
[VILLAIN] *Chuckle. Beckon with your hand: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Come on then.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
This image ([1]) is being synced by other player(s).
It wasn&apos;t difficult to figure out, I assure you. I came seeking Dallis; Kemm wants her, too, as anyone could tell you. I crashed one of Lady Kemm&apos;s little tea parties, did a little snooping. The Void&apos;s vapour there was plain as night to me.
We&apos;ll get her. She won&apos;t get away with it, the witch!
*Turn your back and start to undress.*
In a moment of weakness, we were led astray. We have suffered greatly for our mistakes, and our people along with us. But now... now there may be a way to mend what has been broken.
Contaminated Magister
*The girl looks at you with black, malevolent eyes. But as they take in the sight of you, they widen, and fill with something else...*
In that sense, I suppose I should look upon it all as an opportunity. People crave authority. They&apos;ll beg for a Sourcerer King like me.
Weapons
I&apos;m not &lt;i&gt;trying &lt;/i&gt;to stop them. Just distract them. When they finish whatever they&apos;re eating over there, I don&apos;t want them to start looking for Ma. She&apos;s in our house, but I bet that won&apos;t keep them out.
Salamander
*Tell her you&apos;re alright, but say you won&apos;t need her to fix the lute after all.*
Speaking of roaches...
Spirit of a Dwarf
Bit of a tricksy one, given how I was captured on duty and all. Sallow does not take kindly to failure. But he looooooooves me, so he does. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;pet.
Sorry, do carry on. Just act as you do in your natural environment. Simply pretend I&apos;m not here.
No god, hm? Then who.
Oh sweet Divine. Oh poor Duggan. I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s gone...
How awkward. See, the thing is... just stop. No-one cares what you have to say.
Sounds to me like the dark horse is the best bet in this situation. I don&apos;t like what I&apos;ve heard about the so-called gods.
*Say you hope they&apos;ll be reunited soon.*
And - ...well done, Godwoken. That was impressive. Truly impressive.
*Tell her a new order is coming. She should get used to it.*
*Tell him Harrick&apos;s fine.*
*Tell her it was great.*
Healing spells and potions will damage you for [1]%
The witch&apos;s chicken-scratch handwriting is filled with antiquated language and arcane symbols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With your specialist knowledge, you understand that this is a potion with one purpose: reversing the polymorphing spell on her servants.
*Smiles...* Woof!
*Take the spirit&apos;s Source.*
I shudder to think what kind of sewing circles you frequent, but I&apos;m doing my best with what I have. Here, see for yourself.
*Stay silent.*
Things, I s&apos;ppose. I&apos;m too young to know about things! If my mum was here she&apos;d be able to tell you. My mum knows about things.
*His eyebrows shoot up, and a wry smile crosses his lips.*
*Slowly reach for your weapon.*
*Say you note a trace of agitation in his voice at the mention of it. Ask him why.*
[OUTLAW] *Tell her that&apos;s valuable information. You&apos;re not giving it away for free.*
This veritable tome of knowledge teaches you a plethora of handy adventuring recipes!
*It looked like the squirrel was trying to say something when you first arrived at the Nameless Isle. Ask what he wanted.*

[HERO] *Tell him you&apos;ve found purpose in helping others. Maybe he could do the same?*
Haldur
Fate is like this. She joins the needs of one and the wants of another. We all gain what we must have.
*Justinia pounds a fist against her palm. One smack, then a second, then a third.*
You took care of business too late for my crew, though. All my best Paladins are dead, whether by the hands of the Magisters or the claws of the Voidwoken.
Oh you were missing out! The architecture really was really quite-... oh.
*He looks underneath him, to the rune etched into the floor, and the candles placed at its points.*
*Ask if he&apos;s heard anything new.*
Oh. Well... thank you for your participation?
Grasping Vines
*Tell the Lady Vengeance it is time to depart.*
If the Scion wishes for you to know, she tells you.
[SCHOLAR] *Frown and say that it&apos;s mighty hard to pry a ring from a bloated corpse&apos;s finger.*
*Say that from the sound of it he merely wanted to protect him.*
And now that I&apos;ve answered every question a sane person could conceive to ask of me in this moment, let&apos;s carry on. What did you see?
Custom Marker
[LOHSE] *Beseech her to save you. Release you here and now. Death is better than your slow descent into madness.*
Another sacrificial soul. Is this... is this truly worth it?
*Frown and say that you could have sworn you heard the name... is he a prisoner here?*
*Realise that you&apos;re talking with machinery, and turn away.*
*Inform him that you aren&apos;t interested in helping anyone but yourself.*
You are her salvation, my friend. You are &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt;salvation.
[NOBLE]*You like the sound of this &apos;champion&apos; title.*
*Say you&apos;re not sure. You knew of him, but you never talked to him yourself.*
Stalk Stingtail.
*The kin hums a melody - one you recognise from long ago and far away. It reminds you very much of home.*
I&apos;ve been trying to stop them for years. With your help, as it happens.
I don&apos;t want your money. I want to see you dead!
[IFAN] *Say you&apos;ve brought enough death to the elves for one lifetime.*
Without encounter
Lohar. You been livin&apos; under a boulder?
Barely anything do I remember of these days, hearing all from deep within an egg, seeing only through the filmy veil of my silken sac. But there is one thing I remember well, and that is the very first hunger pang, my tasty petal.
Can&apos;t argue with you on that one. But you want to hear how I ended up leaving, or not?
*Alexandar shakes his head slowly.*
Amplifies brute strength with powerful magic
Turn the target character into a chicken. Squawk!
The souls of the cold-hearted lie ever frozen in ice, alive but not alive, in death as in life. You know yourself well, &lt;i&gt;Lohse.&lt;/i&gt;
The God King no longer grants me his favour. Mask ripped from me and flesh flayed to bone, because the Godwoken&lt;i&gt; still &lt;/i&gt;walks Rivellon.
*Ask the elf why he didn&apos;t help Alexandar when you killed him.*
Get back! Braccus Rex has decreed none of you may approach him.
[VILLAIN] *Tell him that Tir-Cendelius is very disappointed in him.*
[UNDEAD] *Wonder how he knew that you&apos;re undead.*
*Tell her you&apos;re quite convinced, and ask her where you can find the Well of Ascension.*
*Ask who... &apos;He&apos;... is.*
[NOBLE] *Say not everyone is born in a bed as comfortable as yours. This is the right thing to do.*
I like beeeets.

After entering the right code into Lord Kemm&apos;s vault, a heavy helmet of dragonbone appeared inside his cabinet.

*Wince in pain but know you have a better chance of surviving this encounter if you hold still.*
Th... that&apos;s what the log said, sir! No-one&apos;s authorised to be here!

Pitfall
Stay your weapons. Don&apos;t give in to baseless fear.
*Remark to Swann that he might be able to help with this part.*
Now now, fusspot; better to know what awaits you than to bash blindly into the future, wouldn&apos;t you say?
Hmm, yes. They thought themselves well in control. But there is only one master scheme that must come to fruition: &lt;b&gt;MY DIVINITY!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Ain&apos;t that just the truth.
Duna
Speak with Queen Justinia.
*Ifan grips your upper arms. Tight as a vice. Merciless as you well know him to be...*
