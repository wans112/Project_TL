I probably need whatever they carry more than they do, at this point...
Can Backstab. Backstabbing deals critical damage when you attack from behind your target.
Hubris gains the attention of wicked eyes. Luckily, I have the tools you need to stay concealed.
Now it&apos;s your turn to repent, my friend. I&apos;m so glad you joined us here today. Even if you can&apos;t admit it to yourself, perhaps now you realise how crucial you are to our salvation.
Teleporter Pyramid is on the ground
Have it your way, mate.
*This is old elven magic. Scions use vines like these to bring entire forests into being.*
*Show her your summoning powers with Featherfall: you are a master of her kind.*
*Say he should stay right where he is. That troll is nothing but a conniving thief!*
Move along there.
Delay your turn.
Treasure Chest
*Be on your way.*
*Try flattery, and ask why a formidable Magister such as he has been relegated to such menial duties.*
*Take a closer look.*
Cheers. Can I trouble you for just one more? Penny for a lost dog and so on?
*He presses a slender forefinger against his tight lips and hums.*

Once I&apos;ve come to a conclusion, I promise you&apos;ll be the first to know.
Lava Fields
Well look here. This is just what I am looking for!
Not that I don&apos;t love these little chats, but can this wait?!
Show Gareth the way. Help him be the hero he&apos;s meant to be.
Large City 01
Slight&apos;s given where slight&apos;s needed! Sing the praises of the Reds they do! Bloody disgrace, I say.
Attack_Skill_Prep_3
*RIBBET!*
Vindictive
Very well, I can see them straining against your lips. Unleash them, Godwoken. Ask your questions.
[NOBLE] *Bow deeply.*
*The skeleton stands quietly for a moment.*
What do you want from me, Marcus? What can I possibly say at this moment, and in this place, to appease you?
That sounds like Griff, alright. I&apos;m telling you, if he were here, he&apos;d have this place cleaned up in no time.
*Ask what happened.*
Hmm. If you insist.
People are missing out there - sworn Magisters! Keep your jests to yourself!
&apos;So Lucian dropped the Deathfog on them again!&apos;
Large Thunder Rune Of Power
There are others. His chosen. Yet I am no longer among them.
I hatched the egg but left the dragon within - my child - behind.
Uhh...
We burned Creeva&apos;s remains in the Eternal Fire.
But we will only walk its outer edge, I assure you. There really is no need to worry.
[VILLAIN] *Ignoring her invitation, you crush their wedge of cheese under your heel.*
Bloody hell. Poor Hammond.
Psst. Kid. You been down by the room up the hall?
Decomposing
It all depends.
I am blessed, red-sunburst, by drudanae and divinity. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
You know my Gareth? Oh, that does me good to hear. Isn&apos;t he a sweet lad?
My... *ahem*... my turn.
Angry, the lizard courtesan will take no more customers.
It is. I know that better than I know anything at all.
Rather apt, considering my recent nuptials, actually. Nevermind the... unfortunate circumstances of the ceremony. At the end of the day, I am a married man.
Magisters think they&apos;re running a tight ship, but their boat&apos;s as leaky as an old goat&apos;s nipples.
...I killed no-one.
Paladin Warrior
*Stroke his face and tell him you&apos;re his mother. Then ask him for the magic word to his chest.*
Hmm. The fur of a white cat. Could this have something to do with Arhu?
*Push her to concentrate - if she can see you, you&apos;re sure she can talk to you.*
*You catch a glimpse of Ifan out of the corner of your eye. He&apos;s standing tall, gazing around the environment with a feral expression on his face.*
*Tell him that&apos;s right, and unless he wants to see what you&apos;re capable of, he should release the girl.*
Secret Unlocked
I must become the one god of this world.
Sellicha&apos;s Boots
Steel-Banded Chest
Oh, don&apos;t give it a second thought. Do you think I could betray a fellow Wolf, let alone the &lt;i&gt;esteemed&lt;/i&gt; Silver Claw?
If everyone thought like you, this vile place would be little more than a sunny island. Perhaps, before we&apos;re done, we can return it to such a state.
Trailing Edge
You&apos;re gonna get in big trouble if you don&apos;t get out of here.
*Ask what she makes of the lute she got from the luthier in Driftwood.*
...teach all to be both just and kind.
*Note her hesitation. What happened at the wedding, exactly?*
Don&apos;t you know you were &lt;i&gt;tricked?&lt;/i&gt; Tricked by the lizards into killing the elves as you destroyed the Black Ring?
*Hack!* I got my eye on you, moss-muncher. Don&apos;t try any of that Source business on my watch, or I&apos;ll do to ya what the Hammer did to that traitor!
B-but we&apos;re too few as it is! You&apos;ll just have to make do.
*Take your leave.*
Change the options below to enable co-op play.
*But doesn&apos;t he know what happened to his people?*
Stand up.
Retrieve the untainted egg.
*A strange symbol is carved into the stone, details lost to the wear of time.*
Stingtail&apos;s Juicy Leg
*The spirit slowly tries to push himself off his knees... another unseen blow &lt;i&gt;slams &lt;/i&gt;him to the floor once again - for good.*
Come, come Quercus. Time is short.
One word, and it makes you drunk already.
Watch it - last warning!
His soul has been ensnared so long. He deserves freedom.
Come on. We may be here, but at least we&apos;re alive! And ain&apos;t it a gorgeous day, to boot?
*You eagerly follow the Doctor. Your husband&apos;s operation was a success, and now you can see him. The Doctor ushers you into a dark room. There&apos;s a strange smell in here...*
Stonecrusher Armour
An ancient artefact, seemingly able to hold a charge indefinitely.
Don&apos;t get caught.
I mean... come on. I&apos;m not doing this for cacks and giggles. I swear.
*Back away.*
Or at least: on the shoulders of one of them...
[IFAN] *Say that it looks like the Order really did a number on him; you&apos;ll keep your eyes peeled for this yarrow.*
*Mari flashes a massive, horsey smile at you then winces, clutching her side.*
*Ask how it is she&apos;s still alive.*
*Sit by her spinnerets and listen attentively.*
[ELF] *Point at your accuser. They wouldn&apos;t say that if you weren&apos;t an elf!*
Olive
*The door groans open - but an ashen shadow clouds your mind.*
I knew him, and knew his secrets. I saw his rise and fall as woven into the Tapestry of Time.
I hope the next place is better. This was a bad place.
I dabble in all forms of learning... necromancy included. Can you really blame me for being talented? Can you really blame me when I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;forced &lt;/i&gt;to use my skills against my will?
It pains me, but I&apos;m persuaded. I say we surrender our souls. The decision is yours.
Betty the turtle&apos;s love for Rory the rat remains unrequited.
*The spirit backs away from you in alarm - but it&apos;s already too late.*
Aye, she were at that. Sweet, kind, and sharp as demon teeth. She was something special...
*Shrug. You have more important things to wonder about. Like this swamp: why is it so dangerous?*
Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more. There is selfishness. Fraud. Malice. Corruption. Hypocrisy. Treason. The sentence is more. You are frozen in ice. What is your sin?
I knew I could count on you to murder me in a pinch.
Seven let the Voidwoken not find me. Seven let Sallie come that we may leave this bloody place. Seven save us. Seven save us. Seven save us.
Step back, step back... you dwarves don&apos;t know your own power!
The grandeur that is my fate has... hit a bit of a snag, but never you worry: for the throne I was destined, and my throne I &lt;i&gt;shall&lt;/i&gt; have!
No. I imagine you can&apos;t. I imagine no-one can. But the cards were dealt and my people got snake eyes.
How may I help you?
*She grabs the ring and glares at you like a rattlesnake observing its next live meal.*
Ascendant Endurance
*Ifan cocks an eyebrow and smiles at you warmly.*
*Say you were called in from an auxiliary unit to rescue him; he ought to show you a little respect.*
Enjoying life to the fullest, she was truly and finally free.
Elf! Have you seen a human acting suspiciously near here? Grey cloak? Grey beard? A satchel slung over his shoulder?
Bone Cage Scroll
Now, where was I? Oh yes. Four illustrious leaders, gathered here in this room.
*Tell her you are humbled to be in the presence of such greatness.*
I&apos;ll knock it if I want, even if I haven&apos;t tried it.
My, my. Look at you, Lohse. Free at last. Beautiful.
Hey there, weirdo!
The Druid
I&apos;m tired of hearing her beg. The Swornbreaker is ours, and that&apos;s that.
I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t let you leave. Hounds! At the ready!
Grave Anchor
*Hand her the egg you rescued.*
*Lower your voice and tell him you have a proposition for the guild leader.*
*Amid the squalor of Fort Joy you suddenly spot an elf with diamond features: regal and radiant, but cold too, and sharper than any knife.*
Nice to meet another so-called Godwoken.
Once upon a time, I served Lucian. But those days are as dead as the Divine himself, as dead as old Vik here.
Go on, Godwoken. Don&apos;t waste any more time with me. The Arena awaits.
*Take her advice and be on your way.*
Doctor Daeva:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You do not know me, but I know you. Word of your talents has reached me, though in truth I cannot remember who told me of them, since neither friend nor family seems to have heard your name. In any case, I can no longer withstand the madness growing within me - voices of the unseen, visions of the unknown. I ask that you accept me for treatment, and eagerly await your reply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With kind regards,&lt;br&gt;D. D.
Out of the mouth of babes. A couple of children survived the ordeal, with their tattletale tongues in perfect working order.
GREETINGS LORD AND LADY KEMM - BENEVOLENT AND WISE
*You notice that the message is signed &apos;Magister Reimond, in the name of Dallis Most Holy.&apos;*
*Roar in anger. He lied to you. His words about learning, scouting: empty.*
If I didn&apos;t know our shield had everything under control, I&apos;d think we were in big trouble…
Yes, my sweet, you were glorious. The slap of your flesh against my bone will live with me forever.
To save me? From whom, exactly? Oh, Marcus - you always were one to conjure a conspiracy out of thin air. Not your best magic trick.
My people cannot be &lt;i&gt;allowed&lt;/i&gt; to return from the Void. They are tarnished. They are Voidwoken. They can only bring chaos and death. And...
Surprise your enemies by emerging from underground at target position.
Are you &lt;i&gt;threatening&lt;/i&gt; me? A good jest, my friend. Now. Either check my wares, or be on your way.
Here&apos;s how things are going to go down. &lt;i&gt;You&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; kill a slum elf called Saheila for me. In return, &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;tell you exactly where to get just the right weapon for whatever-it-is-you&apos;re-doing-that-I-don&apos;t-want-to-know-about.
Steamcloud Arrow
Heeheehee! Because witches do spells! Heehee!
*Declare that the tavern cook was the culprit. You were forced to kill her when you confronted her.*
*Grab her by the hips. Tell her you&apos;ll show her.*
*The Magister considers you, shrugs, and curls his hands into fists.*
*Whistle. That&apos;s a lot of days.*
