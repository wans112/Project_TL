[SOLDIER] Tell him your name and your rank, and say you&apos;d like to learn more about these missing Magisters.
*The Doctor turns to Fane after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*
*Lohse stares straight ahead, eyes black, skin grey, a malevolent grin plastered across her face.*
Keep your hands to yourself!
I hate to ask another question, but the bond demands it. Sorry, and all that. So tell me... Is there a difference between right and wrong?
Are you sure you want to delete folder [1]?
If you find out from me, you&apos;ll find out the hard way.
This smells disgusting, but... down the hatch.
*Tell him to put up or shut up. Arhu&apos;s coming with you.*
*Ahem.* Okay. The Hall of Echoes once more. Our home away from home...
Mutiny!
Oil Voidling
Oh! I&apos;m sorry, madam, I didn&apos;t mean anything by it. I&apos;m just the handsome gardener. I was in here watering the plants and I saw these robes... I couldn&apos;t resist their silky touch! Please don&apos;t punish me!
I ran from servitude to end in slavery. Do you still not understand what drives me?
I have given you everything - the powers of the gods, freedom from their relentless demands - everything I had, I laid at your feet.
We have departed from Reaper&apos;s Coast, without further exploring this matter.
Kraken Tentacle Slow
Magister Bow
You will learn nothing! My lord has granted me power - I will never answer to another.
*Apologise and return the stolen goods.*
That sack of meat is to guard cave, not answer questions about cave.
I&apos;ve wasted enough time here. There are other matters to attend to...
*Snarl that he can grant you a wish, or he and his lamp can spend infinity at the bottom of a well.*
Thanks very &apos;uch. That&apos;s &apos;etter. &apos;uch &apos;etter. &apos;ut I still think you should o&apos;en the chest.
Hat of Spellcasting
A bribe, eh? A dirty move like that has only one proper answer!
I- I&apos;m sorry, brother. I cannot.
Nope.
Diamond Dust
Isn&apos;t it just? A beautiful, beautiful story...
*He extends his arm and pushes up the sleeve - beneath, the skin is withered and discoloured, as if it were magically decayed.*
Like this one - she hides one of my spores. I know it.
*Show the spirit your personal brand of justice. His Source will be yours.*
*Cough.* Whatever. *Whispers...* And say hello to Rulah for me when you get there, eh?
Reduces the damage from air-based attacks.
My life, Lucian. I pledge my life, please return.
Search for the rat&apos;s owner.
And as a reward for my service, he has granted me his favour. He has granted me Mord&apos;Akaim.
*Clearly he&apos;s been here for some time. Offer a deal. He gives you useful information about the island - you don&apos;t open the chest.*
That maaaaaaaaay be so. But look at the flies, &lt;i&gt;mbaaa&lt;/i&gt;. Baaaaarn wisdom. Flies know when a creature will die. And it&apos;s around &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; head they&apos;re buzzing, not mine...
*Ask what he knows about the Voidwoken.*
Counterfeit Source Collar
*Say your curiosity is piqued. What - exactly - &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;Sourcerous Sundries?*
*Say you don&apos;t doubt that; everyone loves you.*
*Eagerly ask what happened next.*
Ifan. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
Cleaning Up Session
ACTION POINT COST
[SOLDIER] *Point to your sheathed weapon. Does she think you can&apos;t take care of yourself?*
*Put the lute away.*
*Nod. It is time.*
*Say that you&apos;ll eat the fish, if he&apos;s sure it&apos;ll do some good.*
We confronted Kemm over Windego&apos;s accusation of treason, but he denied it. Were we wrong to believe her?
*Say you won&apos;t stand for this. There must be a way to save him still!*
I understand, certainly. Though I can&apos;t help but hope you&apos;ll reconsider.
You&apos;re new, so I won&apos;t report your &lt;i&gt;insolence &lt;/i&gt;- but you had better learn some manners if you hope to make use of the Gallery.
*Oh? Ask what they talked about.*
*Tell him to keep steady. He&apos;s no stranger to death, after all.*
Mmm? Something on your mind?
Blank Necromancy Scroll
Ancient Empire in design and construction, this gleaming staff holds as much potential as you hold within yourself.
*Say you&apos;d quite prefer to meet a god than a parasite.*
I became Divine. My people did not return.
Gareth? He set off to find the soulforged weapons of Braccus Rex. A brave mission, and  a dangerous one. But I cannot stop you if you wish to follow in his footsteps.
We&apos;re liberated! Like the blood of a lot of Magisters. Maybe too many. &lt;i&gt;Maybe.&lt;/i&gt;
I am no mere rat! I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like elves, for instance.
It made short work of Liam, may the gods rest his soul. I managed to escape, but my precious cargo was left behind. We&apos;d invested our entire livelihood in those wares. I&apos;d do anything to get them back.
Here - a little token for your efforts. I had better give some time to studying this tablet now, to see what secrets I can tease out of it...
I was a loyal servant of the Source King. I carry out his will in death as in life, and all that sort of thing.
*He buys it, and in a moment you know what he wants - Alexandar&apos;s head, cut from his body and brought to the Sallow Man in his cave...*
*Tell her she can ask the question, but you can&apos;t promise wisdom in the answer.*
And with that stunning plot twist, we arrive at the final scene! The mistress is uncovered, and the apprentice can be slain!
*You approach the figure and find yourself face-to-face with an undead skull. Its bone is intricately designed, and a jewel sits on its forehead.*
That&apos;s because you haven&apos;t seen that other world in all its glory. It is... majestic. Fit for a prince.
Then there was a voice, promises of protection and power in kingdom come... I became Sworn to the God King, but when I saw his followers - the vilest creatures one could conceive - I realised how poisoned his gifts would be.
*Devour the fantatic as he asks.*
*The queen opens her mouth as if to speak, but her companion shushes her and raises an index finger.*
It gives me joy to see you, my kin.
Braccus Rex. Ruler to some, tyrant to others, long dead to all.
A Godwoken became Divine. Rivellon kept its Source. Wonder remained... and suffering too. This is their world to rule, for better or for worse.
Magister Ranley
It sounds banal, but... I feel better when the air&apos;s filled with song. Maybe the sun really does shine a little brighter, you know?
Marcus - I know you can&apos;t possibly understand, but... she told me of living weapons, crucified monstrosities. Marauding warships searching for victims, demons scurrying along the streets.
Isn&apos;t it rather late, Sebille, for this pathetic show of pride?
I&apos;ve pushed you to the edge? You&apos;ve been sucking the joy from my life for what feels like an eternity.
Bust of Alexandar
Possess
*You are completely ignored. The prayer continues as if you weren&apos;t even there.*
You must stop it!
&lt;i&gt;Damian... Damian... Damian... oh my Lord, release me from this hold...&lt;/i&gt;
Egg? Back? Hmm... What did you do?!
Forest Tiger
You there! What the devil are you doing without your collar?
Approaching hostiles will get smashed by a demon fist.
Yes. &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt;. Simpler to show them. Come.
I should wait no longer and consume it - downward, into the hatch!
Ye don&apos;t know the Outlaw Empress? She&apos;d gut ye for the disrespect, so best get diggin&apos; before she&apos;s back.
I screamed as he traced the design of the scar into my searing flesh, but I could not move, not an inch.
Look - look! I mean &lt;i&gt;listen&lt;/i&gt;...
*Break the seal and open the barrel.*
Ye gods! The indignity never ends.
There you have it, Lohse. Do you feel it? How weak he&apos;s become?
Note that equipping armour during combat does not restore armour points.
Master of Sparks Skillbook
What you witnessed was an exercise in restraint. And jolly good fun to boot.
Trousers of Skill
Search the archives.
You know what I mean, elf.  The dwarves and lizards are no better. The lot of you would drag us all into oblivion with your blind devotion to Source.
*Sniffle*
The God King was victorious. Those who were loyal wanted for little. We children of the Seven were enslaved, our gods forgotten. This is the legacy of the Godwoken.
House Interior - Basement G
*Say it isn&apos;t safe out here; your ship was attacked by Voidwoken not far off this shore.*
*You are one in the night, one great, beautiful being, your bodies aching with desire where they touch, your mind ablaze, your souls entwined, growing great, greater, greater, greater...*
*It also has no lock or handle. But when you run your fingers across the wood, the carved face comes to life.*
Indeed? I might have said the same, once. Yet I can&apos;t force anyone to follow the path of the One. Are you sure you want to reject my words?
Rajjarima stole some of our Source powers.
Of &lt;i&gt;course &lt;/i&gt;not. Nevertheless, I&apos;ll be keeping you in my sights.
*Tell her you&apos;re ready.*
The Knight was one of many in his clan, yet he is the last who remains. The House of Sturmgrave offered countless fearless fighters for the protection of the realm, and they were widely revered for their prowess in battle and the righteousness of their swords. Indeed, so much were they admired that lesser lords grew green with envy. One among them refused to be second-loved among the armies, second-honoured by the queen, and hatched a plan to undo the so-called &apos;House of Heroes&apos;. The lord ordered a terrible act: the pillaging and destruction of a small and peaceful town. Through careful manipulations, the wicked lord succeeded in fingering the Knights of the House of Sturmgrave as the culprits. All were tried, all found guilty by a corrupted judge, and all hanged. The Knight, a mere child at the time, never forgot the gravity of the injustice. The mark of the House of Sturmgrave, the House of Heroes, was upon the youth already, and as the child&apos;s strength and honour grew, so did the desire for justice. Now the Knight rides, leading the unrelenting charge against those who would inflict base misdeeds upon innocents.
Something I discovered in your lizard friend&apos;s basement. She won&apos;t miss it, but use it well.
Dagmare of the Four Sisters
I need to go. Away from here. Away from this. Away from... away from you.
Soon as we get to Fort Joy, it&apos;ll be time to have words with this Borris fellow...
*Call out his name.*
Leap into the air before shooting, gaining damage bonuses for your superior height. Deals [1].
[SEBILLE] *No. But you could have sworn some bastard was getting &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;down just now.*
What are you doing, lizard? Trying to get the drop on me? Sneak up and slit my throat?!
*Listening carefully, you hear the faintest metallic murmur.*
You must find that place of longing in the home of a young scholar. I will draw strength from there to speak again.
We heard tell of a powerful Sourcerer named Hannag. This was Gwydian&apos;s teacher.
*He screams in laughter and delight, his cruel, scraping, booming mirth echoing in your mind. He bows his head, and shows you what you need to know...*
You must not be! You must not be! Even if you are rooted, you can still undo the tyrant tree!
*Say goodbye.*
