[On the first page, you read &apos;Warfare, by J. Hanneman&apos;. After that, pages upon pages of words and verses about death, demons, destruction and war are recorded. Judging. Gloating. Accepting.

There is no monstrosity in our rites. I serve Duna willingly, devouring the dead.
I am Lord Commander of the Paladins, guardians of the faith, Lucian&apos;s own. I &lt;i&gt;kill &lt;/i&gt;Black Ring. Never forget that.

[RED PRINCE] *Tell her that in your heart of hearts you long for another. This doesn&apos;t feel right.*
What are you doing? It&apos;s this *gasp* collar! Don&apos;t you understand. I can&apos;t *gasp* I can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;breathe!&lt;/i&gt;
You should go from here... this is no place for the living, for the sane...
Oh, but you&apos;re a clever one, aren&apos;t you, Fane? Fine - I&apos;m tired of pretending I serve this weak wench, anyway. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
I&apos;m afraid our customs mean less than nothing as long as these collars choke us, my prince.

The others seem to have made this place into a stronghold. This is where we part ways I think... thank you.
I&apos;ll talk to you after you fight... if you&apos;re still around, that is. Go on, &lt;i&gt;shoo&lt;/i&gt; to the Arena Master.
*Shake your head. Nothing yet, you&apos;re afraid.*
*A vision appears in her mind&apos;s eye and yours - of you as the all-powerful lizard. She knows it is wrong, and she knows it is evil, but she still bows her head in submission and willingly gives up her Source.*
Neither of us are inclined to mercy. Let&apos;s make the most of this moment, shall we?

And? You the one that&apos;s gonna tell &apos;em?

Suits me just fine. Lead on - or better yet: let me take the lead.
You speak only when spoken to, scaley. Now, where&apos;s my tea? And it better not be that earthy stuff from that lizardland of yours.
*Still your hands. You were wrong to be so hostile.*
This place is corrupt. We should not linger.

*Huh... you didn&apos;t think about it like that. He&apos;s right, it&apos;s absolutely his fault.*
How dare you? These children are mine and Sadha&apos;s! I will defend them with my life against the lowly usurper that you are!

&lt;i&gt;You did the Doctor a great service on Bloodmoon Island. Some advice from him in return - seek out Sanguinia Tell. She has much to offer - dark and wonderous things...&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her that scholarship is not the only trail to greatness.*

This historical tablet was engraved long ago. Dust fills the etchings like the echoes of time.
We found the dead hero Halla&apos;s treasure in Paradise Downs.
