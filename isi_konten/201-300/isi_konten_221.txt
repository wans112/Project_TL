Without Arhu, his rooms give me the creeps.
*He catches you looking at him and smiles, all tangled beard and twinkling eyes.*
Merchant&apos;s Cellar
Moonstone White
Find someone to help you escape.
*Nod. That&apos;s exactly what you have in mind.*
*You hear the scraping of talons as hot air brushes against your exposed neck.*
My children... I will teach them to be wise. I will teach them to be prudent. I will tame their flames.
A Godwoken? I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s too late for me to help you - what little strength I carried into the afterlife was expended in service of another.
Elven Camp
Cade
Hitting enemies with melee hits will cause fiery sparks to bounce onto nearby enemies.
*Succumb.*
You should have just kept out of this.
Stand back, kinsman, and keep your hands off your weapons! Convince me you&apos;re no Magister, or draw one last, deep breath!
Glad to hear it! But all too sadly all good things must end.
Talkin&apos; scarecrow? Well, I never turned down a friendly face. Even an ugly one!
*Beast fiddles with his beard, but otherwise seems glued to the spot.*
*She looks straight ahead, ignoring you.*
As part of Operation Downfall, Justinia is shipping Deathfog to Arx. Beast may have underestimated her wickedness.
Sewers
*You saw this in your vision at the excavation site. The flaming arrowhead leads to a trial for dragon worshippers.*
Invulnerable!
*You know this language. It is an archaic tongue, spoken only by demons for untold aeons.*
Player left!
Attack
Hmm? Oh no, my instinct to survive is quite strong, as with all mortals. I&apos;m not sure why you would-
Who tended to get &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; bored.
Magical Riveted Boots
It&apos;s attacking! Evasive maneuvers, Quercus!
*His eyes grow wide.*
Pickaxe
Sebille wandered the world.
*Tell him you&apos;re not his mother.*
...their social norms I never could disparage.

[BARBARIAN] *Grin and bare both rows of teeth. She almost brought a city to its knees - and she must pay.*
Medium Constitution Potion
Start In Rags
Now if you&apos;ll unhand me, it&apos;s high time we return to the order of the day! Which in my case is still the domain of dreams of course.
This medium-sized, strength-enhancing brew still smells of the troll whose sweat grants it its magical properties.
Oh, Hannag. Such a sweet dear.
You may proceed. You find no threat here.
*Silence reigns.*
*Reach for your weapon. You have a bad feeling about this...*
*Prays...* They pledge their hearts, O Lucian, the lambs. Please return. They pledge their souls, O Lucian. Please return.
Right and wrong are meaningless distinctions, shorty. Here, only &apos;alive&apos; and &apos;dead&apos; are relevant.
*Ask if he might just take Jonathan to the Lady Vengeance for interrogation.*
[BARBARIAN] *Draw your weapon and show her what you think of her contempt.*
I do not argue with that. I am on my way.
*Ask if she has any idea where Arhu could be.*
Statue of Tyran
Oh, you&apos;ll pay for trying to weasel your way out of this one!
*Refuse to give him the will.*
Silver Arrow
A charmed satchel capable of carrying far more brick-a-brack than most simple backpacks.
In time, I will ask more of you. But now, your goal is simple: &lt;i&gt;Survive&lt;/i&gt;. Escape the grasp of those who would imprison you, who would break you, who would limit your true potential.
Sure do. Ask me, it&apos;d have to be one of those sad sacks that&apos;s always hangin&apos; around Griff, looking for favours.
*Say this is why you should always carefully check any packages people ask you to deliver.*
Not memories, no. This is the war that looms in our people&apos;s future. A war against those who scorn our way of life. A war for which we will need a strong, united Empire.&lt;br&gt;
*She might be playing a trick. Don&apos;t do it.*
Little Tiff
But you know Lone Wolves are a large network of mercenaries, right? On contracts we work pretty independently. You know... &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;.
*Smirk and ask what he, in his wisdom, thinks you should do.*
Join you? Not the worst idea in the world I suppose...
[MYSTIC] *Say that Divine forces guided you here today.*
Nice. Seems like I&apos;ve got a real talent for this.
Destroy [1] on target enemy. They are Terrified for 2 turns.
Craddleson&apos;s Silly Book of Blanks
Commander of the Tides
I know... and so I&apos;m going to help you.
*Say that you didn&apos;t crawl out of that tomb to become a lackey. You want to be a god too.*
Come on, let&apos;s poke around and see if we can sniff out some blind spots in their surveillance...
Fine. Have it your way.
Swirling neath this mirror&apos;s obsidian surface, shadows flit and flutter. You can&apos;t see your own reflection, but you can certainly see something... else.
*The squirrel looks up and meets your eyes for the first time - small, shining beads take you in.*
You don&apos;t have the money to cut that kind of deal.
So. It. Begins.
I do believe your actions amount to the first truly selfless act that I&apos;ve ever witnessed in my time. Bravo.
*Kick him between the legs.*
Lucian has truly blessed you.
Change game modules.
I will return to the kingdom soon. Restoration will begin, Duna willing. Our people will flourish, Marcus. I promise you this.
Well, well. It&apos;s not the top of a white marble tower upon which a bed awaits beneath an infinity of stars, but I suppose it&apos;ll have to do.
Time... time has a way of changing someone. Lucian did not start as the man he became. Nor is the man I am now the same as him that once served at the side of a Divine.
*You said before you&apos;ve better things to do than chase vermin. Refuse to shake his hand.*
*You hear the tiniest whimper from the skeleton before his face caves in, as if smashed with an invisible mace, and the body lies still and silent.*
Granite Protector
You talk funny. And you&apos;re not very clever. I like you.
*Tell the story of what happened: the whole sorry mess.*
I don&apos;t see why not. I&apos;ve got business all around the realm. Same as you.
*Lean in close and snarl that you don&apos;t have time for jokes.*
Doe, a deer
Dallis had some information and - as ever - it proved to be correct. It&apos;s as if Lucian himself whispers in her ear.
*Compelled to taste her too, take a step towards her...*
You again? We have a godsdamned Sourcerer up there and you&apos;re getting in the way.
*The silence of the night is rent with the sound of screaming. &lt;i&gt;Your &lt;/i&gt;screaming as you burn to death.*
I warned you to keep away - you&apos;re under arrest.
Cave Ruins
*He laughs, a dark and crackling sound that seems to make the ground vibrate underneath you.*
It&apos;s peaceful here, but I&apos;ll not be sorry to see the back of these swamps.
Publish
No-one strike a light.
We&apos;re two doomed peas in a pod, eh?
*Note your surprise that Paladins can&apos;t handle a few Voidwoken themselves.*
*The spirit smiles at you. If it weren&apos;t for the circumstances, it&apos;d almost be heartwarming.*
[1] attempts to repair [2]
Never saw you before, lizard. Welcome to Arx. Care to see a trick?
I... I can&apos;t let you go. It&apos;s my job! It&apos;s why I&apos;m here!
*Tell him you don&apos;t take orders. You give them. Then make your move...*
A medium-sized, bright-smelling, spicy elixir capable of protecting you against pyrokinetic attacks.
Did you really think that tall tale would work on me?
One spark and this whole damned place&apos;ll blow!
TELL ME who you found &apos;em on, or you&apos;re gonna have to answer to me, my knife, and each one o&apos; my people. And your little elf friend won&apos;t make it out alive, neither.
*Take your leave.*
You did?! Where? Where is he?
You may have noticed I have tried to help you on your journey. That I can bless the very water beneath your feet. Now, you have that power for yourself.
M-my wife had the key... Lucian guard her spirit...
Greetings. I trust that the &lt;i&gt;item &lt;/i&gt;I gave you is having the desired effect...?
*The elven warrior greets you with a scowl.*
&lt;i&gt;...with the she-lizard.&lt;/i&gt;
Exploration Theme 06 Flutes Orchestral B
*She slides another glass of ale toward you. Its contents sparkle in the dim barlight.*
*For a moment it hangs in the air, unmoving, before it slowly disintegrates to nothing.*
Ugh. I s&apos;pose that crowded brain of yours ain&apos;t got much room left for actual smarts. Pity.
Do not ascend. The web of despair awaits.
Oh, I don&apos;t know. Around and about. Treat myself to some mead. A lover or three hundred. I&apos;d say we&apos;ve earned it.
This immense axe appears to have been crafted solely from hardened spite and malice. It suits you perfectly!
...or maybe I&apos;m just horny.
Go to next party member
*Consume Raedalus&apos; Source.*
*Tell her you&apos;re all ears.*
A blank piece of parchment that can be used to craft a scroll.
*Beast shakes his old friend&apos;s hand warmly and bids him farewell, then turns to you with a sigh.*
*Say you think you may have made a mistake.*
*The man scowls at you.*
Oh darling. It&apos;s not so much twisted as it is... &lt;i&gt;bent.&lt;/i&gt;
Ah, one of my own kind. Be not frightened of me, brother. There&apos;s far worse than &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; bite in this quagmire.
The Ancient Lizard Empire opened its gates.
[1] increases damage of main hand wand attacks.
*Her eyes start to dart around.*
Can I offer you something... special? Something with a hint of... the forbidden? Something with a... powerful taste?
*Ros flashes a satisfied grin and returns to his chores.*
*They turn to each other...*
Thank you, Godwoken. Your trust in me means more than you know.
Toy Wagon
Thieves&apos; Guild
I have the key right here - wait, where is it? Never mind...
Rugged Pants
*Scoff and say he&apos;s reading an awful lot into the body language of a bodiless being.*
Hah. Your choice. Reckon I&apos;ll be seeing you soon enough, mate. Make sure you save up for your taxes.
*You blink and, for a split-second, you&apos;re looking through the soul&apos;s eyes. You see a locked dungeon, cards scattered on a table, and a pair of skeletons.*
Pause
Murderer! You&apos;ve been killing my comrades!
You will either be my champion, or a sacrificial lamb burned at another lord&apos;s altar.
Great! Feed it to me, won&apos;t you?
You&apos;re gonna die.
*Wonder how he can aim to kill the son of the Divine he served.*
[LOHSE] *Tell her you know less about Divinity than you do about sin.*
Matchmaking found [1] friend lobby.
Tell me.
This is the end. A new world is born.
I was told about your temper. About the fire in your veins. Yes, I&apos;ve heard &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; about you, Sebille.
*Ask who &apos;she&apos; is - who killed her?*
*Spit and say they&apos;ll have to loot their &apos;internment fee&apos; from your corpse.*
Nothing to see here, please move along.
The final prize is yours. I am content to follow a more unexpected path.
Lord Arhu is &lt;i&gt;missing? &lt;/i&gt;Well I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t enlighten you as to his whereabouts; the Keeper of the Cathedral&apos;s roamings are a mystery to me - as they are to most.
You there! You cannot just strut around anywhere you want. You&apos;re under arrest!
Right. Okay. Good. I&apos;m going down there then. I&apos;m a wharf rat, I need to be at a wharf. That&apos;s where the food is. Wish me luck...
*The Red Prince glares at you, his eyes two hell-fires.*
Pretty good, ain&apos;t he? Probably ain&apos;t against writin&apos; a poem fer a lizard, either, if yer all polite and whatnot.
the party finally reached the place where Godwoken go to become Divine.
I can&apos;t say. The Doctor will come for me. He&apos;ll fulfil the bargain. Silence is the only answer I can offer.
