*Take pity. Maybe you can help somehow?*
Cannot Be Unequipped
*Say you don&apos;t appreciate being spoken to like that.*
I know, sweet child. Do you think I chose you for that fine bone structure alone?
Living on the Edge
Dallis has been keeping me prisoner here, but I try to keep working on my own projects, when I can...
Keep clear of the Deathfog. I do not know where it comes from, but it fills the wilds. Voidwoken will hunt you, but Deathfog simply lies in wait.
We beat &apos;em back, but... but they got Farray through the heart. Got me across the face. Landin went back to the Fort to bring help.
*Demand he explain what the hells is going on!*
Fort Joy - Beach
Nobody can forgive the use of Deathfog. Not even me.
Arm
[BEAST] *Whistle sharply and order her on her feet.*
Now why on the Gods&apos; green ground would I make things harder than I need to? I&apos;ve got the problem hanging over there...
Make it quick...
*Every Lone Wolf in the land? Ask him how many of his pack are to be found around here.*
Charged Amphibian
*Kill this Black Ring degenerate.*
*Tell him you understand.*
Come now, Ros. Is that any way to talk to a distinguished member of the royal family?
Who could forget?
Desperation leads to stupidity. Among the stupid anyway.
Magisters - Tough
If, if, if I showed you... you could bring them back - BACAW! You could, you, you could bring them back...
Dwarven Pilgrim
Preference is of no consequence, Mistress. I am here to serve.
Who did this?
The Ancestor tells me I am the last. That I am alone.
*Ask if you may see it.*
*She leans forward. Her eyes are wet with fear as she takes your hand.*
I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about! I&apos;ve nothing to do with the missing Magisters! I&apos;m just a tinkerer - I wouldn&apos;t hurt an imp!
Heh, come to finish the job that your foul magic began, Sourcerer?
My remains have still not been consumed by the Eternal Fire - only then can I know peace. Please, help me!
Have you seen many battles, venerable one?
*Say that you want to know more about the ship.*
Birds Deep Forest 05
Thanks. I turn the other cheek this time. But don&apos;t go causing more trouble.
We journeyed on. We do not know what became of Gareth.

[SEBILLE] *Tell him you seek to sink your teeth into a man named Roost. Ring any bells?*
*You clench your eyes and brace for impact.*
Place of Longing
*Spit at Princess Zenthia and snarl that you won&apos;t bow to a miserable creature like her.*
This is not a game, Red Prince, no: I but mirror your soul.
*Tell him to try you.*
Without her... I was left with only the worst within me.
Deep. Now let&apos;s make sure he KEEPS failing.
*So you must steal the powers of the other gods? That&apos;s... uncomfortable.*
You bled him for us, bled him dry.
Sentinel Eye
*Wonder what happened next.*
Consul Zara will return as a dragon, not as a rash-covered kin.
Scientist
I - um - er - yes, well. We all do as we must.

*Insist she speak plainly. She must tell you of her Lord&apos;s plans.*
[ELF] *Say that it&apos;s clear the ship was hewn from an ancestor tree - who was it, in its previous life?*
*Offer him a fresh fish.*
Yeah, this is worse.
Sleeping Bag
Could do without this noose on my neck. Someone around here must know how to get &apos;em off.
No matter what I - bock - say, you plucked idiots always do.
I&apos;ve little to say to one who sabotages the Order. Yes, indeed that&apos;d be &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
*The spirit looks forlorn. Exhausted. Spent.*
You keep your doubts; I have my dreams.
Left Mouse Button
[HERO] *Gently tell him it&apos;s true - he has lost his life.*
*He stoically nods his thanks, and turns away from you...*
*Express the wish to be introduced to Gratiana.*
Flavius Maximus
&lt;i&gt;Sod off - I&apos;m busy.&lt;/i&gt;
Those brutes&apos;re takin&apos; their sweet time down there, and I gotta send word soon.
Indeed. I&apos;ve yet to find a word that captures the feeling of having every hope you ever had, offered and then crushed within five minutes, but... that.
Best of luck, Beast.
*As magical energy crackles between the Sourcerer&apos;s fingertips, Ifan turns to you. His mouth is set in a resolute line, but you can see anger blazing in his eyes.*
*Report that you found and killed the tinkerer.*
*You stay of course. You sleep with her. There&apos;s nothing out there finer than this.*
Hahaha! You think I changed my will? Oh dear dear dear. Lulabelle has earned those riches. Have you &lt;i&gt;seen&lt;/i&gt; the shiteshow this place has been? Have you &lt;i&gt;met&lt;/i&gt; my nincompoop daughter?
*The thing inside glows. It is heavy with satisfaction.*
Yow&apos;ll take what the Black Ring gives yow, Lone Wolf, and yow&apos;ll like it. If the hired help wants respect, it earns it killin&apos; them Divine Order pigs down there. &lt;i&gt;Move, merc!&lt;/i&gt;
The Mother is angry. She desires the enemy&apos;s heart. But... you may still make amends.
Well, maybe he&apos;s more forgiving than I reckoned. Maybe all I need to do is finish what he asked of me. Maybe I just need to kill you and I&apos;ll know peace again.
*Say you&apos;ve no interest in Alexandar; all you care about is surviving Fort Joy.*
Congratulate me, for take my word for it that I will treat my offspring with care.

Sebille... you are &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
Good choice. Its wisdom might do you some good.
&lt;i&gt;Go. Away!&lt;/i&gt;
Worst dream ever.
*You recognise him. This is Barstan Tungs, the self-assured Driftwood bard, whose golden voice filled the tavern with verse.*
Didn&apos;t know &apos;bout the Source in me &apos;til it was too late. Rushed outta me like some kinda flamin&apos; wind. Was nothin&apos; of her left to bury but a handful of black ash.
There is no reason good enough that we the elves must die. Lucian betrays. All the world betrays. And so we fight.
Magister Cecil told us the spore was taken to the Magister barracks in Arx.
Why, whoever&apos;s snatching Magisters off the streets and... &lt;i&gt;disappearing &lt;/i&gt;them! Six lost in a week. &lt;i&gt;SIX!&lt;/i&gt; Need to be ready &lt;i&gt;ready &lt;/i&gt;READY. Ready to protect!
*Prays...* I pledge my heart, O Lucian. Please return. I pledge my soul, O Lucian. Please return. I pledge my life, O Lucian. Please return. *Sigh.* Gods, I need a drink.
Aye, though I&apos;ve no intention of dying anywhere but a warm, safe bed.
...I wonder what kind of music I&apos;ll make. Something danceable, that&apos;s for sure! Or maybe my true voice is actually incredibly depressing. Can you imagine?
*Sporting a roguish smile, grab the front of her dress and tear it open.*
*They both look to you in gratitude, then to each other. A grin spreads across the Red Prince&apos;s face - a grin of comfort, hope, and pride.*

Tovah let us stay in the encampment.
&lt;i&gt;Yes. Kill him - &lt;b&gt;now!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
or did you rebel?
[BARBARIAN] *Snap that the creature can shut up or you&apos;ll shut it up.*
Poisoned Cheese

Smoked Topaz
We sailed from Reaper&apos;s Coast, leaving Tarquin behind.
Bishop Alexandar is dead. What will happen to the Magisters?
*Tell him you are here by accident, not for the purpose of saving him and his gods.*
Well let me see... you tried the, eh...
*You do not. In fact, you don&apos;t like this situation one bit!*
*Gareth inhales sharply, then catches you out of the corner of his eye and smiles, barely.*
I know, I know... not something to be proud of. But they let me do as I wished, so desperate they were for aid after the Deathfog cut them down to size. A fine arrangement, until they started preaching about this &apos;God King&apos; and his infernal Covenant.
*Disagree. Collared in the hold of a prison ship is pretty much &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; how you expected things to work out.*
*Choose green ash. It will heal you and your allies.*
*Allow her memories to continue...*
Almira asked us to retrieve both parts of the Swornbreaker from the Nameless Isle.
Let me indulge you with an explanation: Everything I do, I do for a much greater good. The supreme example of this, is you.
Dallis didn&apos;t tell me anything if she could avoid it, but I did overhear her practicing an ancient lizard dialect - that might ring a bell with &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, might it?
And what do you want?
Don&apos;t &apos;ind that idiot! O&apos;EN DA CHEST!
Provides bonus fire damage for yourself and your allies.
Godwoken, it is your duty to aid me.
I&apos;m glad we were one another&apos;s light.
Getting Your Own Back
Talon
Do not try this again.
&lt;i&gt;Evdek&lt;/i&gt;, I don&apos;t believe I have! Ha! Thank you for asking - now I&apos;ve a new challenge.
*Reach out to try and calm the child, explaining you&apos;d never hurt him.*
Ain&apos;t much to tell. The old lady figured she might as well teach her spawn everything she knew. Thanks t&apos;her, I know which end of the sword t&apos;hold before I start swingin&apos;.
Distressed Citizen
A creature with an elemental resistance higher than 100 will regenerate from that element.
Thank you for your help with that &lt;i&gt;thug&lt;/i&gt;. No doubt he turns on you next. These humans hate us.
*Groan. You&apos;re getting bored hearing about your own exploits.*
You&apos;re looking well, m&apos;lady.
Time is short, Godwoken. The Council awaits.
&apos;Here lies Lief Keller.&lt;br&gt;Hit by a falling object.&lt;br&gt;A loss keenly felt.&apos;
*The Seven chose their path - and deigned to choose yours. They denied you your rightful graces. Now, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; will choose &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; path. Their fate is written.*
Saheila&apos;s Reward
I think I love you.
Eagle-Eyed Guardian
Ignores Stunned status, but still takes damage from air attacks.
*Ask how she feels knowing she killed all those other Scions.*
A winter dragon! What on earth is it doing chained up here?
*Say this matter is his business - not yours.*
I&apos;ll make you proud.
*Offer him empathy. You know how easily a desire for justice turns to one for vengeance.*
But handing it &lt;i&gt;in&apos;&lt;/i&gt;s going to be a problem.
Surprisingly warm given the thin fabric, these leggings are patterned with small feathers on the outseams.
Well good riddance to him all the same - he was a thief, and probably a Sourcerer as well! As for this cook - do you have any proof...?
*Her eyebrows raise, and it would seem her estimation of you rises in tandem.*
*The man sees you approach once more, and flicks his pipe to the side of his mouth in order to facilitate a scowl.*
Medium Memory Potion
The book is dog-eared to a chapter called &apos;Ailments of the Stomach&apos;. Coarse hounds&apos; hairs are stuck between its pages.
The attack has begun. With the Magisters vanquished we&apos;ll meet Exter on the beach.
Oh, I approve! Here you are, and may you enjoy every cup you brew.
You need your weapon redesigned&lt;br&gt;Or want your amulet redefined&lt;br&gt;Then two small runes you can combine&lt;br&gt;To fight the enemy for a while&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the song restarts, as does this rhyme&lt;br&gt;Cause when you do go out of style&lt;br&gt;And once again two runes combine&lt;br&gt;Then front is back, first and last in line
I have no idea what that means.
[IFAN] *Say that you hope it&apos;s a chance to stop the Divine Order.*
Run back to your hearth. Cower there while death searches for you.
I am in need of your help.
How witty. Perhaps if I had a moustache to twirl. But, no, you can rest assured I&apos;m quite unique.
Let me go. *Wince* Please.
