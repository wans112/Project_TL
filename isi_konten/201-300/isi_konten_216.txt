I&apos;ve been trying to stop them for years. Now I&apos;m close to ending it all for good. Will you help me?&lt;br&gt;
C&apos;mon, you can&apos;t leave me here. If you really want me to go on my merry way, you&apos;ll have to tell me &lt;i&gt;after &lt;/i&gt;this little stint in jail.
*You feel hot under her gaze and desperately want to change the subject. You haphazardly mention you can swallow swords.*
*The spirit utters the faintest of gurgles, then he is gone.*
Not quite the rip-roarin&apos; ode I was hopin&apos; t&apos;hear.
*He hesitates. Then he swallows his pride.*
Character is Knocked Down and cannot move.
I live that horror. The truth invites danger. Some would sooner be swallowed by the Void than tell it...
Is there more, elf? Speak up.
*Squeeeeaaak!*
You may be sceptical as you wish, but my grief was true.
Play Campaign
[SOLDIER] *Point out that killing comes with the job. But killing in war is not a sin.*
Curios and keepsakes, many of them potentially elven!
It&apos;s personal. Though I don&apos;t know you well enough yet to say more.
*Tell him you want the stolen loot back and he&apos;s going to help you get it.*
&lt;i&gt;The Void shall be banished. And I, Lucian the Divine, shall return from the dead.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him to go ahead.*
*Tell him the deed is already done: Alexandar is dead.*
Lover&apos;s Quarrel
Unlocked using your bony fingers
Decomposing Swashbuckler
Our blood is in the soil, our ancestors in the trees, our memories in the wood. Our homeland is all of us. You cannot understand.
This is where one of us will ascend.
*In a short missive, Huwbert tells the story of the Kraken. He believes he was once on night passage aboard a large ship when a small boat nearby was taken. One suspects he believes the Kraken to be far smaller than it actually is.*

*He reaches down, grabs you by the back of the head. You allow him to pull you to him...*
*Tell her that the tinkerer has escaped.*
Ultra
*Unfazed, you breathe deeply and ask her name.*
Vicious Stalker
Shovels
With no new Divine, Malady found herself in a predicament. She had an important problem to solve, but no ally strong enough to call upon. And so her search continued...
*She embraces you for a long moment, her face pressed to your body, then steps back, wiping a tear from her eye.*
Watch it. That doesn&apos;t belong to you!
You bargain? Your life - this is my offer.
You... you let me free? What if... what if I&apos;m dangerous? What if I hurt somebody? What if I hurt &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt;
Spirit of Barstan Tungs
*As soon as you move towards him, the dwarf reaches into his robes and whips out a dagger. Thankfully, the ephemeral blade passes right through you.*
Please do come see me again, Your Majesty! I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; speak with you of Brahmos the Wanderer!
It don&apos;t work. For me, anyway.
Ah yes. He was a... pest. He rather fancied himself. Someone gave him my name and he thought he would come for me. He ailed me and I, the physician, healed myself.
Cathedral
It&apos;s almost a pity we found ourselves on such opposite sides. All because of who you are, and all because of who &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; is.
But of course I won&apos;t refuse you. I&apos;ll do my best to drive the demon out. He&apos;s my old nemesis after all: Adramahlihk.
*You pull your arm back, breaking the connection, and see that the deer has grown two long incisors. It gets to its feet, kicks something towards you, and stalks away.*
RUN! IT REMEMBERS YOU, IT WANTS-
Day 14&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more time I spend here, the less sure I am of this. Where does the demon stop? Where does the victim begin? They certainly don&apos;t seem to like it when the body is threatened, though.
Get away! Do you hear me? &lt;i&gt;Away!&lt;/i&gt; *Hiss.*
*Beast begins to chuckle, then guffaw - and soon, he is laughing as heartily as you&apos;ve ever known him to.*
*Smile. Tell him you&apos;re going to destroy the God King and all his people. You&apos;ll be using an extremely powerful secret weapon. The Source King does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to be on the wrong end of that weapon.*
*Look around. Tell him he seems to be out of options...*
You are a female of one of the races; you are perceived as female by those that encounter you.
Freeze a surface
*Press on. What happened next?*
*He holds out his hand.*
*You&apos;re about to ask your question, but you catch yourself: this could turn into a messy confrontation, and there are too many witnesses about.*
*Say you understand.*
As for me... I was already free. And so were the others. The Godwoken&apos;s sacrifice severed the bond between the Sworn and the God King. To atone for my sins I spent the rest of my days taking care of the sick and elderly, telling the story of the Godwoken, that the world may never forget the greatest heroes Rivellon had ever known.
Source Hound Hicka
&lt;i&gt;Are you mad? &lt;/i&gt;They&apos;re our sworn enemies! Whatever evidence the Paladins think they have is false, and I hope my brethren make them choke on it.
A temple in the clouds? What holds this aloft...?
Pumpkin Butter
[RED PRINCE] *Think of the Forbidden City and how you longed to break away. Say you understand.*
One shouldn&apos;t wag one&apos;s tongue at the present, only one&apos;s legs!
Simply put: I am an Eternal. And you are not. You have my sympathies.
*Take a hint and let the matter rest.*
Skin Colour
Find Gratiana.
Do you see, now? It is a marvel.
*Whisper yes. She may know you.*
Saw &apos;em, didn&apos;t you? The Hammer and Alexandar. *Hack!* They gave that scaly traitor what-for, they did!
*You hear nothing but your own.*
*Enquire about his skull. You&apos;ve never seen one carved like that.*
Sand Ridge Frog
&lt;i&gt;RAAAAAARRRR!!&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask who did this to him.*
I pray her blood doesn&apos;t stain the cobbles. I do not want to be reminded of this day.
*Tell him you&apos;ve noticed he moves with the bearing of a soldier. Did he serve?*
*She kisses you back, gently - more gently than you expected - then leans away, flushed with colour.*
That&apos;s him alright. Faith and respectability personified, I&apos;d say. Dunno how we did it, but Conway and I did something right with that boy.
Come on, Sourcerer. It&apos;s always the same tale. You&apos;re boring me.
The elven Scions are the key. After their deaths, the powers and souls of Scions linger on in the vast and ever-growing network that connects all of the Ancestor Trees.
Rhymes Of The Ranger, Part 2
Back sniffing around where you don&apos;t belong? &lt;i&gt;Leave&lt;/i&gt;. Now!
You&apos;ve done much for me. It&apos;s a miracle I even stand here now, frankly.
Spirit of Andras
Oh good! That&apos;s nice. Enjoy!
Unremarkable Civilian
But of course! I consider it my scholarly duty to know what I can of them. Surely you of all people understand the quest for knowledge...
Think they&apos;ll open the shops any time soon?
*On second thought, you&apos;d rather not get up close and personal with anyone.*
And not a minute too soon. The gods are indisposed. This is our hour.
*Ask Sebille about the way she held a needle to your neck. Would she really have killed you?*
*Apologise to her, and ask if you can try again.*
*Reply with &apos;1238&apos;.*
He is cruel and - given that he was not cut down with the rest of his men - cowardly.
You can&apos;t do that!
Oh. It&apos;s you.
*You feel the needle being driven deeply into your flesh and all goes dark. Forever.*
*Smirk and ask if his eagerness has anything to do with the rather intimate aspects of the prophecy.*
*No. You&apos;re convinced he&apos;ll just send you on the wildest of goose chases.*
*Ask why he doesn&apos;t just walk in there and get the ring. It&apos;s not deep.*
Oh come now, they are only dwarves. How much of a threat could they possibly be? Let them alone.
*Crack your knuckles. You&apos;ve had it up to here with his talk - it&apos;s time to fight!*
*&apos;Well now, ain&apos;t you an unfortunate little flounder.&apos; She growls before clamping her hand across your mouth and nose. &apos;Sorry hun, no witnesses allowed.&apos;*
*The scribe writes very slowly and deliberately. You see the name &apos;Tir-Cendelius&apos; at the top of the page.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without helping Almira and Mihaly.
*The priest&apos;s spirit is senseless - he doesn&apos;t see what&apos;s coming.*
Arhu is the least of our troubles right now.
*Delve into its memories.*
Things&apos;re gonna be alright, I reckon. It&apos;s a start, at least. And I like starts better than ends.
Ah, cram it in yer gobblers, the both &apos;a ya.
Migo&apos;s Breastplate
Fire a normal arrow that deals [3] and then finds another target within [2]. Forks up to [1] times.
Alas, success was beyond her reach. Quite fascinating to watch, though. I have never seen a body burn from the inside out before.
It was... unfortunate. But we have other concerns, Godwoken.
There, uhm... There&apos;s one little *Ahem* let&apos;s call it... &lt;i&gt;complication&lt;/i&gt; though.
We continued our quest on solid ground, leaving the floating temple behind.
You want to be purged? Count me out.
Hrrmph. Think you&apos;re special or something? Too good for my verse? You&apos;re a bloody dwarf - same as me!
Floating
But of course, every specimen has their own quirks, their own petty foibles. And I pushed my curiosity TOO FAR with one particularly huge and crimson troll. But it&apos;s perfect! Now I can observe him in TOTAL SAFETY!
Further protection for the Princess. The arena was fashioned after one in our homeland, but the opponents you faced were conjured up by your unconscious mind, your highness.
*The Seneschal falls silent for a long moment, as if processing this question is quite taxing on its cognitive faculties.*
Source is an evil, and the Voidwoken are its children. Leave wickedness aside - bow to Divinity and let us all be delivered.
*The three kids stare at the collar in awe. Then they stare at you, in even greater awe.*
A vial of blood labelled &apos;Lohse&apos;
*Ask what else is going on.*
*From somewhere deep within the inner workings of the machine comes an irregular clanking sound, then a weak gurgle. Inoperable, it seems.*
The Panacea
Devourer&apos;s Dream
It isn&apos;t about authority. I don&apos;t want to hurt you; I don&apos;t even want to keep you here!
Elfie should&apos;a thought twice &apos;fore she crossed Griff. The other newbies are catching on fast. You oughta do the same.
Sadha
*Decline. There&apos;s no way you&apos;re entering some demonic betting pool.*
*Say you put yourself above all else, and you travel alone.*
*You suddenly realise his voice sounds familiar. It was he who saved you from the shipwreck that brought you here?*
Plains - Quiet Road A
Game Master
It isn&apos;t too late for you. Not yet.
They never had a chance to decide their own fate. That hurts more than anything.
A king of cadavers. He seems to have things under control.
*Explain that its master is dead - if it doesn&apos;t give you its treasure, some ape might get it.*
What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
And if you are who I think you are - who I &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;you are - then you may have some good news for me after all.

Exchange Vitality percentages with target character.
*She takes your hand in both of hers and squeezes. The touch of her skin is electrifying, humming with unseen power.*
*The guilt you tried to escape from lies here: bare, throbbing. It was waiting for you here all along, in this filthy chamber at the base of your rotten heart. Your pain pulses, ebbs and flows, undammed.*
&lt;i&gt;You!&lt;/i&gt;
