*A faint feeling flits over you and then is gone - and you realise that that blood is yours. And suddenly your purse feels... heavier.*
*The thought of Divine power intrigues you. Ask Fane what he would do if he had such power.*
Oily Arrows
*Say the queen is up to no good - lives could be lost if he doesn&apos;t help you.*
Has Dallis beaten us here?!
You know, I almost feel bad for you. Lucian is coming back, and you&apos;ll have to answer for that.
Frozen status is ignored, but character still takes damage from water attacks.
Under lock and key.
*Ifan looks around the Undertavern, contentment plain in his eyes.*
*It sounds like a long time ago. Wonder how long she&apos;s lived here?*
Good work there, good work. I can tell you&apos;ve got chops.
Void-Tainted Mackerel

[SCHOLAR] *Tell her you know of The Quorum - but not of this meeting.*
Only one of us can accompany Gawin. The teleportation gloves are on a nearby beach. Along with several large crocodilians.

[SOLDIER] *Tell him that discipline and obedience taught you the meaning of value.*
Someone, please release me...

Warm your blood somewhere else, why don&apos;tcha?

*Tell him the man in the cellar was no Sourcerer.*
I&apos;ll try to remember that!
*Say that you found this Gareth fellow... but he&apos;s dead.*
Everything is going to be fine. You&apos;ll see.
*Slowly shake your head. &apos;No.&apos;*
...but you are desperate - that much is clear. Make yourself of use to me, and I shall help you unlock the Council. You must strike down the one who leads the Black Ring on this island - that is my price.
*The rat hisses at you with sibilant malevolence.*
*Remind her there is some urgency in the matter. If she&apos;d be so kind?*
Do heed me when I say that &lt;i&gt;under no circumstance must she be allowed to ascend to divinity!&lt;/i&gt; The demon, not she, would be a god. It would bring about the end of time and space and all creation as we know it.
Knowing her name emboldened Iris to expel the demon.
The weather has been frightful.

I... I was not worthy. I&apos;ve failed the Gods twice over now - all I deserve is nothingness.
He say he&apos;ll touch it all day long...
Power, plain &apos;n&apos; simple.
Starstone Blue
Perhaps I may concentrate on hearing Amadia&apos;s voice once again.  Perhaps now I&apos;ve done enough to earn peace...
*The couple tenderly kisses, then Sadha leads the Red Prince away.*
*He lowers his eyes to stare at his black, squirming hand.*
O Lucian, protect my brother&apos;s spirit. May our dearest Martrico walk by your side in the Hall of Echoes...
Compassionate
*The guard&apos;s face blanches, then returns to colour.*
We turned Jahan down. We&apos;ll go demon-hunting in Arx without him.
*Your lizard lover turns to you. She looks embarrassed.*
*Ask why they performed the ritual she described.*
*Deep inside, your God hisses in anger. &apos;Do it!&apos; It snarls. &apos;All will be well, just do it...&apos;*
You healed me...? A complete stranger, just like that?
*Reach out and grab his arm. You won&apos;t stand by while an unconscious man is beaten.*
I don&apos;t know! It could be anyone in the tavern - none of them have any love for the Magisters.
To you, maybe. Rest of us still have something to lose!
We already found the Deathfog, bub. Queen&apos;s got some shite goin&apos; down. And I mean to end it.
Done. *Gasp!* Done. I know where we need to go.
Victor Voss? No idea who that is, or who these thieves are. I just sell the most marvellous of cheeses. Surely you fancy a taste.
Dressing Panel
*Ask it where it learned to play.*
Nice try. I guess you&apos;d prefer to answer the hard way...
I&apos;ll remind you you said this when all our dreams, our greatest aspirations, have come true.
*Your hand falls listlessly from the jar. To die down here would be a terrible. To live down here for eternity...  well, you know that horror.*
*Tell her Wyvlia admitted she&apos;s been using suspicious meat - that is, &lt;i&gt;people &lt;/i&gt;- in the house stew.*
[SWORN] I had no choice. The God King demanded it, and He cannot be denied.
The only armour worthy of our Empress! You acted as the Devourer&apos;s hands, his will for creation.
*The titan lies in pieces before you; the god controlling it is dead by your hand. *
Flaming Nailbomb
Goodness. How can one mind be so &lt;i&gt;feeble?&lt;/i&gt; To think, a simpleton touched with Divinity. The Gods really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;cruel.
Master! Wake up! Never ever. Never ever?
*Inform her that Gwydian is dead.*
A Mirror of Blackest Glass
You must escape from the island you are on. Break through Fort Joy&apos;s walls and venture into the Hollow Marshes.
*Apologise to your daughter. You didn&apos;t know. How could you?*
My master has lost interest in you... but I have not. Leave, my darling. While you still can.
*The spirit nods - and is gone, along with whatever satisfaction - or guilt - he carries with him.*
Seven&apos;s Saviour
*Nod. Tell her there was a strange voice. It seemed to want you to survive.*
*Lohse smiles and inclines her head. Her eyes flash-- first spectral blue, then a shadowy grey.*
Please please please!
*ROAR!*
She had her accomplice, Vredeman, claim he could train me how to master my Godwoken powers - but it was a lie! He was preventing me from unlocking my full potential.
Cello
I... I recognise the lass. The royal guard had come to Bonn Neffin, right on the sea. The poor, they were disappearin&apos; off the streets. The lass spoke out. The guard wanted her... silent.
*Say you&apos;re no expert. He should see a healer.*
*The spirit of a farmer takes in the destruction of the nearby environment with dismay.*
But where does one look for a god when the gods are dead?
The combination to the vault is: 15R 34L 23R 35R 9R 16L 33L 45R 51L 1L. Try to get it right.
*No point in letting Source go to waste. Consume the spirit of the Magister.*
*The kiss is long and sweet as rosewater. As it endures, you can feel a whole new power invade and expand your spirit.*
Ancient Empire Tome
*Patiently explain the schematics - the cutting blades, the skin hooks - all the apparatus needed to remove the facial skin from a humanoid.*
*What? Ask why she&apos;d just give you that information.*
*Ask if the healer has any potions available.*
Please, don&apos;t go.
Not if I show you &lt;i&gt;first.&lt;/i&gt;
*Reach out to the spirit.*
*Tell him to hold on - you&apos;re not done with your questions. What else did he do for Dallis?*
B-b-b-ock!
*The fawn is thrown into a panic, struggles to its feet, and crashes through the undergrowth, where it falls again, landing broken in a stream, reflections of moonlight dancing all around it.*
A Divine Order proclamation announcing a change in the Order&apos;s leadership.

I see through your lies. Criminal! Over here!
There should be at least one map
*Shrug. You wanted the Source was all.*
Cursed Spider
You&apos;re no Magister, judging from that collar around your neck. How&apos;d you come to be here?
Aww, feeling empty-headed, are we? I&apos;d ask if you were born yesterday, but you&apos;re clearly a little older than that!
*The spirit meets her fate with an intense scowl.*

You&apos;re not nice.
Deflective Barrier
Yes. You&apos;ve taken a low road, Ifan. But, you&apos;re not dead yet. Are you just going to fulfill contracts forever?
Is that like a good dog? Because I &lt;i&gt;am &lt;/i&gt;a good dog!
Ranley. Caulker&apos;s Mate. &lt;i&gt;Lady&lt;/i&gt;-bloody-&lt;i&gt;Vengeance&lt;/i&gt;.
We found Cottontail&apos;s toy ball. Perhaps it will convince her that her master prefers Dot.
*Take your leave.*
[IFAN] *Decide to bluff your way through this, and say you bring dire news...*
Ifan supports my claim on Divinity.
*Let Isbeil continue. It&apos;s a nice trip down memory lane.*
Deliver Alexandar&apos;s head to the Sallow Man.
Anyway. Lone Wolves, you said. Question is: why would I interrupt peeling them potatoes to tell you about Lone Wolves?
Blood to blood!
*Acknowledge that you are indeed Godwoken - and that Lohar has spilled her evil secret.*
Venture on down the hatch.
*Nod. You have found it most insightful.*
&apos;ullo.

How about you back up and take a look at what happened to the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; trespasser...
I am bidden to serve you, as promised once, and promised eternal. And so, as always...
*She fidgets and fusses, blinks at you twice, then turns away.*
*The elf shrugs listlessly, his eyes scanning his omnipresent collection of notes.*
Twinksinker
You took the song book from Dallis... but who knows what else that witch is capable of. We should make haste, before she has a chance to reclaim me.
Very well, but report anything suspicious. I will not see him escape!
*Shake your head. He doesn&apos;t have to thank you for anything.*
*He nods in return.*
Uncanny Evasion
Hammered Scale Boots
Indeed not. Your aura is - well, &apos;weak&apos; is probably not the correct word...
*Ask for a classic.*
I bet Magister Viktar wouldn&apos;t say the same. But then, he&apos;s not saying much at all anymore, is he?
Mangled Torso
*Order him to wait here a moment.*
[UNDEAD] *Smirk. He knows more than could be good for him.*
Lone Wolves only share such information with friends. Are we going to be friends?
*Put the device away.*
*Shrug. None of his backstabbing lackeys made you break so much as a sweat.*
Did you find them?
It hasn&apos;t? The wicked king... he&apos;s dead?
I&apos;m not smelly! And anyway, you&apos;re not Dallis and you&apos;re not Alexandar!
Oh... well, that&apos;s terrible news. Truly. She was an interesting character. Tough. Smart. She didn&apos;t deserve that.
Petrifies enemies in [1] range.
My journey into the heart of the Nameless Isle was fraught with danger - the forces of Void did everything in their power to prevent any Godwoken from ascending to grasp the powers of the gods. Try as I did to resist them, I found myself sworn in a Covenant with their supreme overlord, the God King. I was now bound to him, but I continued on my original path nonetheless. Ultimately, I made my way into the first part of the Council - the Academy.
But -
Kraken Tentacle Fast
*Bow and take your leave.*
They elevate me. The spores speak, as Scions speak to the Ancestor Trees.
Come to the sanctuary, and come soon. Friends await you there.
Aye, the Dreamer passeth by, chased by shadow...
I blessed the very water beneath your feet. Now you may wield that power for yourself. So take it with you, back to our beautiful world. There use it to make that world &lt;i&gt;yours&lt;/i&gt;.
What in the flyin&apos; farts was that? They done nothin&apos; to harm you! Good dwarves, they were, treasured children of Duna!
*The spirit of a dwarven knight acknowledges you with a solemn nod.*
We destroyed Trompdoy&apos;s Soul Jar.
