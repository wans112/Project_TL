I am here at the behest of my master to offer you a simple exchange. An offer of aid for the promise of aid. The epitome of civil reciprocity.
Applies Shocked.
With Paladin Olyvie as her new jailor, the prisoner&apos;s fate has not yet been decided.
Oi! You look the kind of ruffian who can keep a secret. Fancy a good time? Head downstairs in the Black Bull tavern - tell the lummox blocking the way that Blaithin gave you a tip-off.
Description
Please! Even if I &lt;i&gt;hadn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; been rotting out here in a swamp waiting for you for days on end, I&apos;d know the face of the Silver Claw anywhere. You really want me to say it? Oh, alright, &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar&apos;&lt;/i&gt; and all that...
Bahara is her name, and she resides in the swamplands east of the fort. I must venture there post-haste!
Right again. As always.
*Insist he&apos;s got you pegged all wrong. Justinia is family. You can help her see the error of her ways.*
Oh dear, but I&apos;m afraid he has retired to his Cathedral chambers. He is preparing the Lucian&apos;s Day benediction, and must not be disturbed.
*Promise to enter the dream, but say you haven&apos;t chosen a side yet.*
We may even make it into Cranley Huwbert&apos;s!
The prophecy was fulfilled. A dragon was born. We&apos;ll take it with us and leave Sadha behind.
City Guard Cleric
Not just one Sourcerer. Two. Master and apprentice.
Wyvlia, the tavern cook, is dead.
Some say this is merely a metaphor for the gift of magic that Amadia gave us. Others hold it as pure truth.
I can&apos;t pretend to understand Her Majesty&apos;s actions. But I&apos;d sooner obey her than a betrayer and beast. No - you are &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than beast. You serve &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; purpose, spread &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; warmth, bear &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; burden.&lt;br&gt;
To the Arena
That&apos;s where I come in.
From the lurid illustrations, this half-ripped book appears to be a distasteful tell-all tale of exploitation at the hands of the Lone Wolves. But perhaps a closer read will reveal more?
&lt;i&gt;Guurrgle!&lt;/i&gt;
Coral
These will take effect any moment now. I can&apos;t thank you enough.
Poison Dart Scroll
You cannot change the difficulty when you are in [1].
*Accuse him of being reckless. He put the region in danger.*
Lemme out! Lemme outta here!
Urrha the Snake Charmer
He is a good man. He will try to do well. But you, I think, will be the one to make the true difference.
You. You made me feel welcome in this world.
Insolence!
Most... most &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt;. An assassin kills them in their sleep.
Settle an argument between a cat and a dog.
Please, sir.
But fine. Don&apos;t let me get in the way of your petty, fragile ego. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;handle it.
If any buck rabbit asks, you didn&apos;t see me - got it?
Tree tree tree tree. Gotta get back. Gotta guard. Can&apos;t let it out. Can&apos;t let them know.
*Tell her a cold pint on a hot day is the closest &lt;i&gt;anyone &lt;/i&gt;can get to meaning.*
[FANE] *Tell her you never asked for any of this. But you sure as hell won&apos;t sacrifice yourself for her.*
*Ask who he means.*
*Ask her what you should do with it.*
[3] fireballs come crashing from the sky. Each does [1] within a [2] range from impact.
Risky, to try and buy me. You are lucky - your price is good. Leave.
*His smile fades.*
What is this world but a training ground for the next? What is this decaying body but the tool to get me there?
I was freed of the tyranny of the God King.
A distant place called Nemesis. I couldn&apos;t resist the lure of this world though - such bloodshed and despair truly does loosen purse strings.
*She composes herself and draws her weapon.*
*His dark eyes flash at you.*
*Scowl and say it was a fair question - what difference could a bloody fishworker make?*
&lt;i&gt;...really, I&apos;m not. &lt;/i&gt;Say hello to your &lt;i&gt;Mistake.&lt;/i&gt;
Too steep!
*Find another way across.*
*Stand by and do nothing.*
Five hundred escapees? We would have noticed.
Connecting to NATPunch server failed
Lovely little curio. Rather precarious to the touch, no doubt.
Report the caravan attack.
Hello again... I, um... hello.
We are not afraid of being the villain to your supposed &apos;hero&apos;. We&apos;re not nice. We&apos;re just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*The spirit looks at you with deepest indignation.*
*Mabel snorts, but you can see that she&apos;s fuming.*
*Silence.*
Then you&apos;ll have the power you seek - if not the power that trumps it. There will always be one greater, you know.
I see no-one. In fact I only hear the sound of Griff clearing his throat. You know how he does. *Ahem*. Like so. For some time I think Griff takes his own supplies, but I see the anger in him that he does not find it. He truly does not find what he seeks.
[MYSTIC] *Tell him not to further taint his soul by trying to taint your person.*
They must have left some evidence. Why else try to burn it?
Min Umn
Neither the warmth of your touch nor the fire of your passion. I may as well have been churning butter.
You... you are &lt;i&gt;known&lt;/i&gt;. You are on the doctor&apos;s books. He awaits you; go to him.
Perseverance
Are you sure you want to start a game in Tactician Mode? Fights in this mode will be especially challenging. You cannot change this setting once the game starts.
Nah, I&apos;ll just have onnnnne more and then I&apos;m off. Just one more...
No offence meant towards your own venerable carcass, of course.
I saw her enter the city, with the Whites! Or did I? Did I dream it? Am... am I dreaming &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt;
Suppose we&apos;d better move inland a little... out of tentacular reach.
I fear, however, that even if you do not, this Adramahlihk &lt;i&gt;will.&lt;/i&gt;
[JESTER] *Say &apos;That, but... you know. Like you &lt;i&gt;mean &lt;/i&gt;it.&apos;*
*Offer your empathy. Surely the Sourcerer meant no harm.*
Ancient Matriarch
I insist you stop sneaking about.
But I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s beyond repair now. Maybe the original maker can fix it.
There could be a good reason why no-one dared to enter in the meantime...
*Say you had hoped for more.*
*Bow your head once more and offer a prayer; you want to travel again.*
But do not let that dismay you. You will save all of existence. You will save your kin, and your loved ones, and all the rest of the mortal world. And you will become a God.
You made it, I see. The Gods aren&apos;t through with us yet, it seems.
*Say you are very satisfied.*
As much as I would enjoy sailing these waters with you, I fear our time is short.
*Announce you would like to include all of your nearby companions - even the sovereigns hailing from other realms.*
*As she pushes off of you, she reaches lightly into your pouch. She rifles around for a moment, but doesn&apos;t seem to find what she&apos;s looking for.*
*Tell the rat you can&apos;t help it. Turn away.*
Suit yourself, Humdrum Hilda, suit yourself...
Alexandar&apos;s Blessing
*Show Gareth the Purging Wand, and tell him you&apos;ll take care of the Shriekers.*
A gentleman among jesters, you are. Give that lever a pull, and I guarantee we&apos;ll both get something out of the deal. &lt;br&gt;
A ridiculous story. I do not believe you.
The jar is broken. Now, the soul within is free to find its rightful home.
Things ain&apos;t lookin&apos; good. I know the queen&apos;s up to no good in Arx, but my lead is good and dead. You ain&apos;t the most strappin&apos; lad I&apos;ve seen, but you&apos;re better &apos;n a floppin&apos; corpse. Probably.
Personality
*Calm Gareth. He should spare Jonathan - it is the merciful choice.*
This is no time for jokes, stranger. Can&apos;t you see what a terrible time we&apos;re having here?
And of course I&apos;d think of you. Of the adventures we had. Of our unlikely, yet heartfelt friendship.
*Say you think she shouldn&apos;t do this. She shouldn&apos;t change. You like her like she is.*
But perhaps you could help me once again. I&apos;ve had but a taste, and these have been hungry years.
Huntsman
Minor Resist All Potion
At last the Lady Vengeance set sail for Reaper&apos;s Coast.
*Insist. There&apos;s people meat in the stew.*
This could be the only egg of its kind in Rivellon for all we know... it should be kept safe.
All those people we snuffed out... they&apos;re gone now. But there won&apos;t be more, ever again. Not there, at least.
Big Lizard&apos;s Club
*Ask why she turned her home into a refuge for these Seekers.*
Did you think I wouldn&apos;t find out? Did you think I wouldn&apos;t know what you did? That was my letter. Not yours, and certainly not &lt;i&gt;theirs&lt;/i&gt;.
Dodging
*Brahmos the Wanderer told you all about your dragon destiny. Is that what this is all about?*
Eggy baby here and gone! Little eggy here, here, here... and gone!
*Implore the God King to not be too hasty. There&apos;ll be other opportunities - other ways to serve.*
*Leave him to his rage.*
The story of the greatest heroes Rivellon had ever known.
Radeka told us that blood roses are a rare bloom that grow only in soil rich with the blood of the tortured dead.
Siphon Poison Skillbook
*Say you hope to find something you&apos;ve lost.*
There&apos;ll be no rewards until this matter is settled! I&apos;m going to have to start from scratch now - if you come across anything suspicious - &lt;i&gt;anything at all &lt;/i&gt;- you come to me right away!
We cannot risk him setting it off here - too many would die. I&apos;m loath to trust a lizard, but can you lead him out of town and end it there?
Force End Dialog
Her actions led to the deaths of countless lizards. We can&apos;t let her go unpunished!
Drop Out
A painting of the long trek Lucian made to the Council of Seven to be anointed as Divine.
Noxious atmosphere enabled!
Current
*Reach up to touch your own mask. Is she truly one of his people?*
No opinion then? Who do you think will make it out on top? The lizards? They&apos;re the strongest, certainly. But the elves are the most cunning. None can match dwarvish vitality, but humans can adapt to any conditions.
Whisperer
Keep your distance. For your own good.
You caught me off guard. No-one catches me off guard. Who are you?
D... d... death...
*Smile and pull her close. Make love to her.*
Stonegarden
*Nod in thanks and unsheathe your weapon. She&apos;s told you all you need to know; she&apos;s no longer of use.*
I&apos;ve never heard such silken tones from a naked skull.
Quiet, child! Run. Now!
Who goes there?
Don&apos;t hurt me!
*Gareth glances over his shoulder, and his voice tightens.*
*Ask the Red Prince what you should do now.*
What&apos;s... happening?
Bock. Bock.
Music
The hatch is blocked from above!
Nothing you can do is worse than &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;
The chance that this character will successfully block an attack from a weapon.
*Tell him he has no authority over you now.*
What I did had to be done, Sebille. It had to be you, for you&apos;re the Prime Scion. The other Scions knew you - welcomed you. They sought out their own killer.
*The cat purrs loudly as it curls itself around your ankles.*
Paste
Ya made it back, safe and sound. That&apos;s all ya gotta think about right now.
*The spirit of Karon looks at you. For once his gaze is crystal clear.*
*His heavy sobs shake you. He buries his face in your breast, winces with pain, and rests his cheek in your shoulder instead. Some minutes pass.*
*Nod. You&apos;ll check it out.*
Here lies Withermoore the noxious
Speak with Almira.
