...the umber monkfish! Ah yes, it&apos;s coming back to me know. A remarkable creature, the scholar of the seas!
Deal [1] to target character. When they try to move, they will take piercing damage.

Dallis, you maniac.
Poisoned Bottle of Wine
*Tell her you&apos;re a bit... peckish. Does she have any eggs to spare?*
Lohse&apos;s Lute
Oh, Ada. I think you know me better than that.
*She doesn&apos;t meet your gaze and stares, dazed, at the floor.*
Sewers
Possessed Dwarf
*Tell the cub it must hide from larger animals, and hunt smaller ones. Also berries are good to eat. Some of them. Don&apos;t eat mushrooms though. Mushrooms probably aren&apos;t.*
*Tell him you&apos;ll gladly sail, if you&apos;re sure of your captain.*
Catch you later, skipper. It... it&apos;s good you&apos;re here.
Damn it, is nowhere safe?! Red-robed lunatics at sea, those Voidwoken seedlings in the swamp: it all points to the Great Acorn. It&apos;s coming, Quercus!
You don&apos;t need me to tell you that.
Open/Close Group
Your smouldering half-demon pet can attest to that.
[LOHSE] *Say that you consider yourself a musician rather than a rescuer.*
Ah, Lady Xantezza - you were the only one of the Seven that could take a joke.
Oh, precious. It&apos;s almost too sad to take advantage. But my princelings are hungry... and just look at you. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;food&lt;/i&gt;.
Saddle Brown
Of course, of course. Me too. It&apos;s something you and I quite share in common, Lohse. The Seven, on the other hand... they&apos;re like leeches who&apos;ll suck this world dry if we let them.
A silly thing to say, but then again, I did think catching me off guard was impossible.
This life, this plane, it will be as it always is. Almost. The demon Adramahlihk, however, may prove an... unstable element.
Your kind? You&apos;re not a bloody-&lt;i&gt;AAAARGH!&lt;/i&gt;
Poisonous Skin
Raise a glass and praise the dwarven race...
Aw.
My book is in my hands, my face turned away from you... Perhaps my eyes not on the page? Damnable things...
Brewed to perfection in one of Rivellon&apos;s oldest monasteries.
Take this spear. It destroys evil. It helps you.
*Ask him where the Red Princess is.*
*Note that the dwarven thug seems happy to rip off one of her own.*
My people are gone. Worse than gone.
*You have been a spirit for a very long time indeed. This afterlife has been spent resisting the pull of the ancestor tree that wants your Source...*
You&apos;re no Paladin, but why should I tell you?
Exploration Theme 04 Light Intro
And unless you want to die too, we need to go &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask what he thinks the dwarves are concealing exactly?*
I&apos;ve still got a contract to fulfill. But after that, getting the hell off this island sounds good...
I see, yes! Consider your opinions signed, sealed, and soon to be delivered!
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The host. Take her. The host. Take... take... the host...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
The most marvellous magic, right at your fingertips!
Grown in the Rivellonian Grain Belt, this wheat smells like the warm, earthy ground that grew it. Can be ground into a fine, high-quality flour.
I was wrong about you.
*Shake your head. Magisters are only dangerous if they&apos;re provoked.*
...thank you... now I swim... monsters... gone... swim... free... swim... forever...
*Search him for news of the Red Princess, and her fate in the heat of the battle.*
What happens between Godwoken is what must happen. One must emerge Divine.
*She narrows her eyes to obsidian slits and gazes at you with such malevolence you can almost feel it tickling your spinal column.*
*She takes your hand and looks out over the sea of souls once more. She leans against you, letting you support the smallest bit of her weight.*
*Quicken the pace. &apos;Whiskers!&apos;*
Removing a blindfold lost us the challenge. If one of us wants to be champion, Murga must... go.
*Let it happen. Let it all begin.*
*Tell Griff he has no right to keep a man locked up here in such bad conditions.*
I am blessed, soft-slither. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
*She shifts weakly where she lies and doesn&apos;t look up.*
I hail from the land that was. The kingdom of fog. The grave of divinity.
Oh, how&lt;i&gt; unfortunate&lt;/i&gt;. We could have been &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; good friends.
Begone! &lt;i&gt;Begone &lt;/i&gt;from here! Ngh... where is my champion?!
Look - I ain&apos;t gonna say we&apos;ll be best friends or whatever, but I do better with a crew than without. So whaddya say - mind if I tag along?
Holding this translucent blade causes your hands to shudder and your head to tingle.

*Ask why she&apos;s associating with human thugs.*
No excuses. We are on the path to Divinity - nothing can be allowed to drive us from it.
*Look at her with concern. Tell her her eyes are looking worse...*
Careful! Do that again and you&apos;ll answer for it!
&lt;i&gt;His &lt;/i&gt;eye is on you - and I don&apos;t want to be anywhere near you when he blinks.
I... I feel better...
I told you already - keep out of my hair.
[IFAN] *Smile. Say your crossbow makes a better case than you could.*
A functional weapon best used for backstabbing, this estoc has seen better days; its blade is chipped and nocked, its hilt twisted.
Now, NOW, or didn&apos;t you hear me? WHERE GROWS THE YARROW?! Dire, dire, dire, and for you too if you want to keep your top screwed on and your wires in a row. Do you hear me?!
*The dragon nuzzles you with its snout. It accepts you as its friend.*
I appreciate your hard work so far. It&apos;s over now, though. Let&apos;s finish what we started.
*Note that the Lone Wolves are formidable fighters. Perhaps it was unwise to go against them.*
Indeed? Tir-Cendelius, if I&apos;m not mistaken. Always was rather the slow sibling in the pantheon, wasn&apos;t he?
Invisible
*Tell him it &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;isn&apos;t his day. Consume his Source.*
Beryl Griff rewarded us with her husband&apos;s valuable notes on ancient runes.
High and Low
*Smile and thank her, adding that you&apos;re not able to consume spirits.*
Erma? Where are you dear? Mummy&apos;s worried sick about you!
*Ask them what&apos;s going on here.*
*Shake your head in disgust. You never would have suspected...*
[ELF] *Suggest there may be wisdom in doing as they ask. For the good of our people.*
Jahan agreed to help us, but only if we helped him first.
*And such an offering must be placed in the dragon&apos;s mouth.*
*Thank her for the information, and take your leave.*
*Blink. Tell the eagle to keep his claws far from your eyes if he wants to live.*
*Tell him that he can&apos;t give up - he&apos;s meant to save the world!*
*Mention that the groom has fled. Does she know where he might have gone?*
*Ask what he&apos;s building.*
No! You are better than this. Resist him!
You need help. &lt;i&gt;Serious &lt;/i&gt;help.
*This book is filled with pages of notes on necromancy, eternal life, and the dark arts. Near the end, you find a passage detailing how to inscribe this darkness on paper.*
Don&apos;t stare. It matters none. Insanity takes many guises.
I see through your lies!
*Say that you&apos;ll endeavour to be a better friend.*
She made a pact. He&apos;ll see that she keeps it. No matter where she roams.
Rusty ballista
*Her heat enters you: thrust upon thrust until she scalds and with a scream, her nails digging for blood, all becomes an echo of the primal soul - a burst of overwhelming white.*
I did not ascend. I shared my Divinity and gave the Source back to the world. May no more harm be done in the pursuit of power.
You are exceptional, even among our kind.
The future of all that is depends on you, and you alone.
(I don&apos;t think we&apos;re getting the potion, Mabel.)
[NOBLE] *Snort that if you ever resort to digging through fish guts he&apos;ll be the first to know.*
If you truly know him, you will be so kind as to bring the Red Prince to me. With haste.
Let it out, Beastie-boy.
Ugh. No. It seems I&apos;ve *cough* gone soft.
*Tell them that&apos;s nothing - your daddy is a god. Probably.*
...and so will I remain, and our people alongside me, unless you do what must be done.
Murga
Only beta trolls hide &lt;i&gt;under&lt;/i&gt; bridges...
Ifan ben-Mezd! Right? Glad to see you made it.
That&apos;s baloney and you know it! An old dwarf like me ain&apos;t so easily tricked, kid!
...four tankards of beer? No, that ain&apos;t right...
Every kid&apos;s dream gift... maybe.
Sure. Can&apos;t say I blame you.
Careful! What are you doing?
Greetings.
*Tell him it won&apos;t come to all that. Septa is dead!*
*He motions for you to be on your way.*
Steel Helmet
I may not know much about divinity, but I do know that any Godwoken worth their salt will know how to perform &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;these oh-so-fantastic feats.
*Amadia hangs before you, her face cut and bruised, her chest barely moving. You think you see a tear run down her cheek.*
That thing knows more than it lets on. Maybe we can use this creature to our advantage.
[SOLDIER] *Kick the door, right in the teeth.*
If you have nothing to hide, I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll go just fine. *Mumbles* Bloody lizard...
Nuh-uh! YOU do!
Fact of the matter is, you lot have outlived your usefulness.
See? Told ya! But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll revenge your death! Take that, Sourcerer!
It&apos;s the Void! You must embrace the Void before you can gain more Source.
*Say that you spoke to the woman&apos;s spirit, and say that she was subjected to Magister experimentation.*
I fear I may be lost. Forgive me...
*Mischief flashes in his eyes.*
&lt;i&gt;The Doctor sends his ill-wishes. You killed his advocate - now you must paaaay...&lt;/i&gt;
Applies Haste.
Bobi
Stay safe.
Wait - what are you doing? &lt;i&gt;Nooo!&lt;/i&gt;
*GLUG!*
Gareth will help! Gareth will keep us safe. Gareth will take us home.
Flexible but not flimsy, sturdy enough to withstand any storm and skirmish.
Another tree dies. My heart is wounded.
*Reach out and grab Beast&apos;s arm. Now isn&apos;t the time.*
Dead Dwarven Mage
Blue Ball
I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d survive those wounds, yet here I am... it&apos;s a miracle! And now Gareth&apos;s returned to us as well. Maybe our fortunes have changed for the better.
*Blackness. Light. You peer through fog to see two dwarves, eyes as black as coals. They are dragging you through grass and stone. &apos;Perfect bait. The Master will be pleased,&apos; drones one of them.*
Sebille... you made it. Good, we&apos;ll need all the help we can get. We have to get this ship sailing, or we&apos;re done for.
&lt;i&gt;...shoulda paid...&lt;/i&gt;
*She gives you a coy little smile. Her mouth is crowded with dozens of tiny sharp teeth. Shreds of rotten flesh are lodged between them.*
*Ask how many &apos;associates&apos; he has - are there many Magisters working against the Divine Order?*
Mmm-hmm.
If I&apos;m right - if I find him - he has a date with a needle.
*Say you&apos;ve made more unlikely friends in your days. What&apos;s the big deal?*
As the races united behind Lucian, Arx remained the centre of power.
But check in with Lord Kemm, he&apos;s conducting an investigation of all the Magisters in the barracks. &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt; might know something about her whereabouts.
Bandit Elf Rogue
*Admit that the priest is dead. But at least the school is cleansed of its filth.*
Are they worth more to you than your people? Than your home?
*More? What does he mean, &apos;more&apos;?*
A &lt;i&gt;visitor&lt;/i&gt;... tell me, do you like puppets?
I don&apos;t mind sitting on the sidelines for whatever comes next, honestly. After so long in the crosshairs, it&apos;ll be nice to be a bit... out of the way.
