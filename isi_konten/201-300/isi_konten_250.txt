*&lt;br&gt;The experiments continue apace. I&apos;ve suffused prisoners with the mind maggots, just as planned. So far, none have come to fruition as a full Gheist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**&lt;br&gt;There&apos;s a lot of... activity... happening outside. I can hear fighting, but I don&apos;t have the time to investigate. I MUST craft a full Gheist before Lucian&apos;s Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;The Paladins have locked me here! In my own investigation cell!! They say I&apos;m under investigation for &apos;colluding with the Black Ring.&apos; Unbelievable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;****&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s been days. No word, no sign, nothing. I have no idea what is going on in the outside world. My experiments have wasted away to nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*****&lt;br&gt;One of the Paladins came in last night. He said they KNOW I&apos;ve been colluding. He said he&apos;ll come by to question me tomorrow. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT&apos;S GOING ON!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The rest of this journal remains blank]

*Say you&apos;re rather fond of the stuff. What does he need?*
*Tell him you heard yelling coming from above. He needs to get up there.*
&lt;b&gt;Mixing Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experimentation has been improving recently, thanks to the large numbers of &lt;i&gt;“willing”&lt;/i&gt; customers down here in the Undertavern&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve tried every combination of herbs I can think of down here. Many sent them into fever dreams and manic rampages, but there were a few mixtures that stood out as being quite useful - perhaps useful enough to win me the Herbmaster’s Pestle next year in Arx!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courage:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drudanae &amp; Farhangite&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increases constitution&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ferocity:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drudanae &amp; Augmentor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increases productivity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alertness:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drudanae &amp; Puffball&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increases wits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enlightenment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drudanae &amp; Calocera&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increases intelligence&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Her notes continue into a frankly horrifically graphic rendition of experiments she made into dramatically extending the effects using Void-tainted fish.]&lt;/i&gt;
*Proclaim that you are willing to slaughter anyone standing in your way.*
Stay clear. This is between me and the Red Prince.
A girl&apos;s wedding should be the happiest day of her life... mine ended up being my funeral.
A skeptic, eh? I get it. Trust is hard to come by in the Hollow Marshes. But to know my name is to trust in me, just as it was with the late Divine.
Some fell to the hands of the Magisters. More to the claws of the Voidwoken.
Find somewhere that peddles ferocity herb mixes, then add the bream that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; gave you - the effects of the new mixture could be quite interesting...
*Ask if the troll belongs to her.*
The Sourcerer that Vasnya told us about is dead. Maybe we can learn more about &apos;Seekers&apos; and &apos;Godwoken&apos; from someone else.
Then again, the Meistr&apos;s chosen ones tend to be full of surprises, don&apos;t we?
Alright. We need her subdued, understand? Do whatever you can to weaken her - just don&apos;t go too far or you might kill her!
*The cat whines as you draw close. You hold out your hand, but it ignores you.*
Help Almira out.
Green Copper Ring
Oh, it was a real beautiful sight it was, &apos;til it wasn&apos;t. Voidwoken came outta nowhere, trashed the place and tore up most of the guests. A real bloodbath.
And what came of him? Did you confront him?
Hm. Lohar? Wanting &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;then?
Power Infusion Skillbook
Careful now. It lies.
*Tell her you can only resurrect certain people.*
City Guard Mage
Sandals
*Slowly reach for your weapon.*
...the yellow ridgeback! Ah yes, it&apos;s coming back to me know. A wily creature, not the easiest to catch...
Dunno about you, but I never was afraid of bugs.
*Correct her: Champion to &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; god. That point was made very particularly.*
&lt;i&gt;That&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; it, ben-Mezd. That fierce spark of zeal is why I chose you, why I saved you from that sinking ship. You try to hide it behind apathy, but the light shines through.
It won&apos;t budge.
Another Godwoken, desperate for power? Very well, as you wish.
Those words were your last, lizard.
*Take a nervous look around. Liquid Source attracts bad company.*
What&apos;s to think about?
*Squeak*Squeak*Squeak*Squeak*Squeak*
*Step back and laugh. He can&apos;t seriously want to arrest you in his current condition.*
*Ask if he actually cares.*
*Raise your voice and ask Kemm why he was pressuring  Arhu to open Lucian&apos;s tomb.*
*You kiss each other passionately, ready to face darkest dark.*
The baaaaad man hasss the key. Taaaaake it from him.
Doesn&apos;t surprise me in the least. All you warmongers use the same tricks, which goes to show the enemy of my enemy is still my enemy.
I&apos;m glad daddy still lets me come. Missus Griff is nicer than most grown-ups.
I ran away from bad man.
*The spirit wracks and shakes with terror in front of you, her very essence dissolving before your eyes. Her last whisper can barely be heard on the wind...*
*Say that amid all the hustle and bustle, you forgot to ask her name.*
They - ARGH - they &lt;i&gt;woke something. &lt;/i&gt;It calls itself an Ancestor.
Worse, I gave them a weapon to use against their own people. The Source of the Veil would have made them unimaginably powerful.
*Ask about the dead lizard Magister hanging from the scaffold.*
A shame Gareth couldn&apos;t make it, though. At least he died doing what he loved.
*Tell them you&apos;re a Sourcerer, too. It&apos;s a comfort to know people like them exist.*
*Take the deal. Set them free.*
You know not of what I speak. It is well that you do not.
We wished for our enemies to be purged from our sight, and the Djinn gave us a powerful scroll.
*Ask something else.*
Can&apos;t let the boss see me chatting.
*Tell her it can be hers, but not for free.*
I&apos;m sorry. I just... I just want to move on.
I have spent quite enough time alone to be comfortable with my own company, and I shall not hesitate to go my own way.
Why, only a few hours ago I saw you skulk about that ship like a lost child in search of its mother.
[FANE] *The very first thing I did when I woke up was to kill someone. Unfortunately...*
*Her voice freezes into a harsh whisper.*
*Ask if she knows anything about the murder that happened on board.*
*The hymnal you found described a burning guardian such as this. Sing the melody written within.*
Hm. An odd... aftertaste.
*Tell her you&apos;ll gladly take back that gold you let her keep, then.*
The spirits within are particularly feisty as well. Can&apos;t say why. I&apos;m as gentle as can be! Alas, I am stuck sniffing out herbs and fungi on the outskirts.
He was just trying to make light conversation. These horses may find their bowls of hay spat in if they&apos;re not careful.
Silence Broken
They&apos;d be in the treasure vault. It&apos;s hidden better than most - tucked away on a beach west o&apos; here.

*Whatever memories this elf once held are lost to the Void.*
[MYSTIC] *Pay no attention to her challenge, but say there is a presence here. A divinity is reaching out to you.*
*The Magister stops barking orders. He sniffs the air like a predator; turns to face you: the wolf eyeing the deer.*
She made a deal with our master. But her reward? Her obligation? Strictly confidential.
*Tell him everyone&apos;s got to stick to their own kind, especially now that the world has become so dangerous.*
*As you stretch towards it, you start to hear whispers in the back of your mind. From the corner of your eye you see dark shadows rising.*
Inert Clawed Wand
Sympathy? Nay, what some intrusive corpse thinks does not concern us: only that what it has done.
Bastion
but the God King never forgot my failure.
The Great Mother Tree is poisoned. We do not protect her. I would gladly absorb every drop of infected sap, but the axe comes for me first. You are the last hope, Sebille. Do as I say.
*The Magister takes in a raspy breath, but otherwise does not respond.*
I did not kill Alexandar, you stupid ape. Release me!
To deepen our mastery of our powers, Hannag would steal the Source of the forest. We agreed. All the animals died.
Spare me! It would be laughable to even contemplate the throne of gods could be yours. The inference would be you&apos;re worthy of a position higher than a doormat.
Fine-lookly crop this time.
*Snort and say he clearly wasn&apos;t worthy. Why should the Seven give him something he didn&apos;t deserve?*
*Thank him and take your leave.*
*She grimaces, looking away from you.*
*Ask her to tell you about this ritual.*
You know, the Order&apos;s been goin&apos; on about Godwoken for an aeon now. Voidwoken still lurkin&apos; though, and they&apos;re still haulin&apos; folks off to the Joy.
[1] makes your grenade throws never miss.
Now? Now I&apos;m going to have to start from scratch now - if you come across anything suspicious - &lt;i&gt;anything at all &lt;/i&gt;- you come to me right away!&lt;br&gt;
*Say no. There haven&apos;t been very many and besides, they&apos;re good exercise.*
Poisoned Porridge
Mmmm! *Groan*

Come Quercus, we must  - *sniff* oh, I think you have something in your eye, my friend...

There. Much better. I apologise for my irritability just now.
*Ask what&apos;s in it for you.*
This will all blow over, trust me.
Surviving, as best they can. They were hit hard by the Magisters.
*She steals a look upwards at the source of the screams, then looks away again with a shudder. Another ghostly scream intensifies, hitting a peak - *
That is a mistake... one you pay heavily for!
Examine the monolith.

How could my husband do such a thing? &lt;i&gt;I LOVED HIM!&lt;/i&gt;
I hope you were a better soldier than you are a liar, friend.
Summon Source Hound
You should have just forgotten about all of this. Deathfog&apos;s got nothing on me...
Return to Gareth.
Pigsbane is dead. His burning desire for revenge quenched at last, Syrus Oates is at peace.
&apos;Reaper&apos;s Bluffs&apos;
*An unseen force &lt;i&gt;yanks &lt;/i&gt;the copper out of your grasp. Tarquin catches it, and offers you a thin smile.*
The Shadow Prince sent me after the Sallow Man, leader of the Black Ring on the island. I can use Sallow&apos;s magic mirrors to locate Sadha.
A tortured soul, finally free.

*You know he&apos;s hoarding Deathfog. It&apos;s a shame he won&apos;t survive to use it.*
Magisters aren&apos;t known for their mercy. Many of us died... and the ones here will likely follow the same fate, by a slower road.
Beard? I  don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any Beard. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
Oi painter-man! I told you ta get lost!
[ELF] *Say that you know he tried to help your people. He can&apos;t be blamed for the trickery of others.*
No longer shall I dance on the ocean. The end is almost here.
*Inform the spirit that he is dead, while you are not.*
*He stands up and scrapes his throat, but before he can say anything she silences him by sliding her hand in his.*
*The spirit tugs and tugs at the Source collar around his neck, though it budges not an inch.*
Grown-ups are weird.
*Retort that he has no right to the moral high ground - the actions of him and his mistress Dallis have led the world to the precipice.*
We find ourselves on an unfortunate footing: the Red Prince lives, and so too, sadly, does the Red Princess. This cannot be allowed to continue. You leave me with no choice. &lt;i&gt;Shadows!&lt;/i&gt;
The Seven - fools that they are - each gave up half their powers to create the first Divine. To bathe in the lake is to become Divine.
I&apos;m Han. So... you helped me out just there and I&apos;d like to return the favour. You want to get out of here?
*The Magister waves his hand and the executioner&apos;s blade falls. He then nods to the next victim in line - the slain woman&apos;s brother.*
