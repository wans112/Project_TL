May the goddess keep you for saving that little lion heart! Young Han told me the story of his rescue! Oh, you are most welcome indeed!
So, how about this: I&apos;ll give you a little discount if you can answer a riddle of mine. And then you can go away, yes?
*Tell him that his legacy - and everything else in the world - will be consumed by the Void if he refuses to help you.*
Ancient Inscription
You&apos;re nothing but a bloodthirsty wretch! I am a &lt;i&gt;prize trophy animal&lt;/i&gt; - I won&apos;t let you or some damn pox humble me. I shall recover!
Alright, then. Do be careful out there, though. Best to keep to yourself.
*Tell her Kniles once described his old room to you. He said that if you were ever in Driftwood, he&apos;d like to show it to you.*
You presume an easy escape. No such luck.
I&apos;ve almost had it with you. Consider this your last warning.
Choose...
*Muse that it very much depends on how people wield the powers of divinity.*
*Nod. You understand.*
Instead of honouring Lucian&apos;s sacrifice, we squandered the second chance that he won for us.
*The Sourcerer nods a grateful smile at you, picking herself up from the ground and backing away from Ifan.*
I know what you need. And I can help you. &lt;i&gt;We &lt;/i&gt;can help you.
*Tell him we&apos;re not out of troubled waters yet.*
[SEBILLE] *Respond to the guard with a traditional elven greeting, and say that you wish to bear witness to the ritual.*
*Look from her to the drink. Shrug and drink it down in one long gulp.*
&lt;br&gt;Boost: [1][2]
We submitted to Lucian and Dallis and were purged. All Source was banished from Rivellon.
*Behind the Magister, a bloodied mass lies in a heap. Gore and limbs lie at odd angles; you can&apos;t make out a face amid the mess.*
You honour me with your repeated presence. Something on your mind?
Ki-kuk...kuk...kuk...&lt;i&gt;kuh?&lt;/i&gt;
She was part of the Order. Knew Alexandar personally. Alexandar &lt;i&gt;trusted &lt;/i&gt;her, at least as far as you can trust a lizard. To repay that trust, the Meistr gave Alexandar up to his enemies.
[BEAST] *Tell him that in your experience, a treasure chest is only worth opening if it&apos;s been hidden first.*
Th-thank you. I don&apos;t... I can&apos;t... I&apos;ve never known such kindness. Thank you. For everything. May you walk forever in Amadia&apos;s grace.
Dallis willed it, and I was in no position to refuse. She wanted to use Braccus to sniff out the Aeteran - to use a tyrannical king as her personal bloodhound, so she could get her hands on the most powerful purging device the world&apos;s ever seen.
*The cub brightens.*
Look. I don&apos;t know where you&apos;ve been and what you saw. But I believe you believe it. And I guess that&apos;s what matters, yeah?
*Bow your head. She has seen much. It is time for her to rest.*
*Accept the invitation.*
*The severed undead head looks at you with puppy dog eyes. You&apos;re touched. And revolted.*
[BARBARIAN] *Say that sounds like a body that has been both beaten and stabbed.*
I suppose so.
Scarecrow
That&apos;s the spirit! You go ahead and soften him up for me. Hop to... and don&apos;t even &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; this championship is over yet.
Regret? I am not prone to such weakness of character!
But, look! Tir-Cendelius smiles! My seedlings grow strong. May their life bring joy to our own.
Lookout Helmet
Yes, of course. Here - you should take it with you. When you find her, give her the doll and tell her Mummy says this is for her little chicken, and it&apos;s time to come home. That&apos;s what I call her. My little chicken.
ARGH! Sorry - thought you were that other mad elf.
*Say that this isn&apos;t the time to mourn - it&apos;d be best to keep moving.*
From all things metal, shape and mould; This rune of frost, with water cold; To summon magic, add the dust; And make it truly marvellous.
*Groan. Yes, you remember all too well.*&lt;br&gt;
poison
*You tire of this. &lt;i&gt;Where. Is. The Master?*&lt;/i&gt;
Webbed Victim
*Say you&apos;ll not return to any cell; you are no prisoner.*
Tides in and out and in again.
And so did my heart.
See? I told you.
Effort_Sh_2
I don&apos;t fear you. No matter what you may think, what any other might say, you have no-one to fight for but yourself.
Tell me, what do you know of your - our world&apos;s history?
No harm done, then. But do avoid acting in haste. The world does not look kindly on such... fundamental mistakes.
*Collared by Magisters in the far north, you were force-marched to this foreign land. A moment of hope as a grinning dwarf removes your Source collar. Seconds later, Voidwoken death.*
Books
Thanks, chief.
*The Doctor turns to Lohse after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*
Get yer act together. Lohar ain&apos;t gonna flay ya just &apos;cause Mordus covered his tracks good.
*Tell him you&apos;ve been west, discovered the dwarven hideout and found this rather interesting letter...*
Pet Pal
If I catch you thieving around here again, you&apos;ll be sorry. Understand?
We found a magical burning chest. It demands a password.
*Crouch at her side. What has become of her?*
*Pull back your hand from hers. Not this time.*
They... they won&apos;t listen to me. Not anymore.
That stupid rat just walked right into its death.
Oh ho! My friend, you are an adventurer after my own heart! I have heard many stories in my day, but none as exciting as this.
What, this ol&apos; gaggle of weirdos?
*This bastard wants you to kill the mother of your children! But he could help you find her... &lt;i&gt;Feign agreement.&lt;/i&gt; Say you&apos;ll kill her.*
They&apos;ll cure you of your Source. Nightshade will cure you of a headache, too.
Suit yourself.
You believe what they were doing down here? That&apos;s some dark business. Damian himself would have been proud.
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Let the voice continue.*
Fighting is done for the day. Whatcha comin&apos; back for? My suave personality, or my good looks?
*The spirit&apos;s rage burns on.*
I think she&apos;s a madwoman. She was there in Fort Joy and she&apos;s here still in Arx. Yet what does she speak of after all she&apos;s been through? Nothing but death and domination.
Good. We&apos;ll catch him yet!
*He puts his arm around her as she starts to sob.*
How much murdering does one Seeker need? Let&apos;s &lt;i&gt;go...&lt;/i&gt;
My pet Godwoken lost. To assuage my disappointment I, the arch-demon Adramahlihk, consumed the Godwoken&apos;s soul.
Uploading...
Not to mention, &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; one to talk.
&apos;Here rests some of Granson Locke.&lt;br&gt;May the rest of him find peace.&apos;
Kemm - please.  Kill me if your damned honour demands it, just - not here. Not in front of Marie. Take me to the dungeon.
Kemm! Kemm! Lord Kemm, finest Paladin in all the land, right Jimmy?
Home? There&apos;s no such thing.
Shall you take the Path of Blood? I have little hope for a success this year.
Very well. We know that Dallis and the Whites conducted their heresy from these barracks.
*Ask him to indulge you.*
Deathmatch with Monsters
[IFAN] *Step closer to him; doesn&apos;t he recognise you?*
Heehee! Maybe you&apos;re right. At least they don&apos;t mind where anyone goes. They know we can&apos;t leave the island. And it&apos;s a lot nicer out here than inside.
*Leave the dog alone.*
Don&apos;t rightfully know what it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;supposed &lt;/i&gt;to do. Johannys the Umpteenth brought it back from Bloodmoon Island. I thought it might be good for stirring stew, but the cook gave it back. Said it made her &apos;feel funny.&apos; Whatever &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;mmm&lt;i&gt;mmm...&lt;/i&gt;
Please, no! Don&apos;t- please!
I found a portal in the consulate garden. Perhaps it shall lead me to answers.
*Hocking a phlegmy gobbet in your general direction, the sullen Magister settles back to his task of glowering at Ifan... and now you.*

Name&apos;s Laslor, thanks! And, erm, I&apos;m not sure I follow.
*Tell her to go ahead.*
*Insist that you have a keen eye and a sharp mind - you could be of use to him.*
*Say you don&apos;t know anything about that.*
*You feel lightheaded... the Gods now seem like tyrants; feeding upon their worshippers&apos; Source like they&apos;re &lt;i&gt;cattle raised to be slaughtered.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Hold up both hands and shout for the figure to stop; you are not its enemy.*
Now, I can still do something to bolster your strength - do you wish for me to help you?
It could be worse... far worse. The world still spins. Braccus must have failed to seize the power that I unearthed for him...
*Hold your empty hands aloft and tell her to trust her instincts - she knows deep down you tell the truth.*
*Ask if his name is Stamley by any chance.*
*Say you have your own problems and walk away.*
Heals
*Turn away and leave it be.*
And so it ended. A tale that began with my own ill-fated attempt to rid the world of the Godwoken.
*She gives you a shy smile. It&apos;s charming. And it may be her tell. She may well be lying.*
Don&apos;t worry, Lohse dear. Mama Malady&apos;s will think of something.
Pray friend, do you think we haven&apos;t seen death before?
Fletched with forest thorns, this Elven dagger hurts as much on the way out as it does on the way in.
&apos;ey up, if that ain&apos;t true. I miss the rockin&apos; of the waves and the moanin&apos; of the planks under my boots.
Handwritten Note
*The Meistr&apos;s spirit stares you down as the tentacles of your Source slither up her body, across her face, squeezing, dragging her power into you until there&apos;s nothing left.*
It is for &lt;i&gt;us &lt;/i&gt;to know.
Villagers... some slain by Voidwoken... others, perhaps not...
Raft
Time I sought out this ship of yours, I believe. The sea air will do Mihaly a world of good, no doubt.
Get away from- *cough* from me, you louse. I do not deal with lesser creatures.
Our evidence from the Blackpits confirmed that the Magisters had strayed from Lucian&apos;s way. Kemm&apos;s Paladins had no choice but to act.
None.
*The brother smiles at you. His sister still does not agree. A life is not worth living if you do not stand up for what you believe.*
Their gaze isn&apos;t the only one we need to avoid, either. Bishop Alexandar is here.
Although it hisses louder than a Caldian steam bath, combining this arrowhead with an arrow shaft will make it a powerful projectile.
*Ask why she looks so surprised.*
The Devourer&apos;s legacy is your fate. Turn away and I will crumble you to ash!&lt;br&gt;
*Slane narrows his eyes and turns his head away.*
*Tell him you&apos;re a bit lost. The armour was alive?*
Worn Sandals
Go!
[ELF] *Brush off his comment; you&apos;re doing fine on your own.*
[SEBILLE] *Say that appreciate his kind words.*
Kemm felt Dallis would be foiled by the absence of Lord Arhu. He was unconvincing. Our search for Dallis continues.
*You tug and tug, but your finger remains attached to the skeleton&apos;s bone.*
I doubt anyone will figure out what happened to them now. I don&apos;t think the Paladins care about that kind of thing.
*She turns to you in horror. But she was Godwoken and she is no fool - she knows you&apos;ll do the same to her. She&apos;ll flee into the Hall of Echoes... forever there to be alone.*
*Its red-stained mouth curls into a grimace.*
Prefer a cage, do you? No skin off my nose. I&apos;ve got the perfect cell for you.

Relics of the old world remained,
My doors only open on the occasion of truth. What you admit to them, you admit to me, redscale.
