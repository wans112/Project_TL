Nobody
This character has been possessed and is immune to Fear, Charm, Sleep, Madness and Taunt.
*Refuse.*
[DWARF] *Point at your accuser. They wouldn&apos;t say that if you weren&apos;t a dwarf!*
No! Go! Please. Master...
If you ask me, the Whites fled the moment the fighting began. The cowards.
The fish is indeed malignant! Lizards are affected by it in the same manner as other species!
Of course, mass murder is very, very wrong. Or so I&apos;ve been told.
Guards! Arrest Isbeil! She is no child of Duna!
Fine. But stay out of trouble.
One more step, and it&apos;ll be your last.
*Admit you don&apos;t know. What &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;you say when a cat wins the dog show?*
*Ask what happened to Dallis and Vredeman when the Kraken attacked.*
Still no sign. I&apos;ll flush the rat out, wherever he&apos;s hiding. He won&apos;t get another one of my brothers...
I do not have time to explain. Every moment the spores are further away.
Oil Pump
but no local would speak against her.
I&apos;ve got armour to fit dwarves of all shapes. Take a gander, yeah?
We canâ€™t put em off forever.
Bloody dwarves... I&apos;ll come back to you. And you better be ready to talk, hear?
*You aren&apos;t there.*
*Ask who trapped him in that chest.*
SELECTED PLAYERS
*Urge him forwards. You&apos;re happy for him to take the lead.*
*Ask this being who he is - and where you have come.*
How well do you understand the more intricate details of the combat system?
*You catch a glimpse of your own reflection. Your skin is discoloured, your features deformed, your nose hooked - *
Find out what Brahmos wanted.
You face the consequences!
Looks like it&apos;s not my time just yet. Give me a hand, will ya?
DeSelby may be wearing our colours, but she&apos;s not one of us anymore. She&apos;ll rot in here.
Not a fan of lizards, are we? That&apos;ll soon pass. The dead don&apos;t discriminate.
Zorl-Stissa
*Bow down to Duna. Give yourself to him, body and soul.*
Here is the truth, Ifan. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; Lucian&apos;s son. And I took &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;actions necessary, for the good of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;.
But mistress, these clasps and straps, they&apos;re so difficult for my strong and yet sensitive and playful fingers. Would you...
Yes, and wolves are just misunderstood puppies, sharks are overly affectionate fish, and the Gorgon is simply having a bad hair day.
Under her rule, the Dwarven Kingdom fought for the Divine -
Lord Arhu has told us what he knows about entering the Tomb of Lucian. First, we will need a Source-filled Amulet and the Scroll of Atonement in order to get past the Path of Blood. Later, we will need to pull a sequence of named levers, the initials of which will spell out &apos;P.O.W.E.R&apos;. Beyond that, there may be further obstacles that he cannot help us with.
RAUGHHHHHHHHHH!
They may be nothing but mortals, but like all mortals they have their uses. Return to Rivellon, seek them out, and force these &apos;Masters&apos;  to share the knowledge they have gleaned.
Lovely day. Perfect weather for it.
Marg&apos;s bridge is mine. &lt;i&gt;Mine!&lt;/i&gt;
Of course it is. The truth&apos;s right there. Skin deep - so to speak.
My duty ends here though. Hopefully the others made it.
the other to bring back the Scions.
[Opening the book, you see it&apos;s filled with crudely drawn pictures and children&apos;s stories about Djinn. Looking at the first page you see a picture of a Djinn with huge muscles, while a buffoon with massive ears holds his lamp. You sigh and read on...] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then the beautiful Djinn asked the stupid mortal what his wish was.&lt;br&gt;&apos;Well,&apos; said the idiot, &apos;I wish that no-one would ever laugh at me for being a stupid mortal with big ears again.&apos;
A Magister is not a Sourcerer. Our cure is less bloody. And rather more &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt;.
*Say that you&apos;re not sure how to say this exactly... but Baran&apos;s ghost is haunting him.*
I met with Sadha in the desert camp. It didn&apos;t end well - she attacked me.
And you think that won&apos;t happen here?! We&apos;re like sitting ducks!
&lt;i&gt;then they may live... for now... that they may kill the divine pigs and kill the godwoken kill them all and then perhaps they die and rise again&lt;/i&gt;
There, maybe now your pet will have a fighting chance. Yes yes, you&apos;re welcome, but can we &lt;i&gt;please &lt;/i&gt;get on and save the world now?

Knight of Tir-Cendelius&apos; Axe
Well, you may be innocent of one crime, but you sure are guilty of others. Looks like you&apos;ll be spending time in a prison cell!
It is done - my knowledge is yours. Use it wisely.
The Seekers find and protect Sourcerers with special talents. We should tell them we&apos;re Godwoken.
Ah, there you are! High time to stop gallivanting and resume our journey together, wouldn&apos;t you say?
But it is not your birthright that makes me take note of you, Your Majesty. It is your &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; lineage, more ancient and more powerful even than the empire that fathered you.
*Defend Lucian - he must have had his reasons.*
Specific
*Ask her what happened.*
Which way shall I fly infinite wrath and infinite despair? I myself am hell!
The priestess of this shrine told Gareth some ancient secrets, some defences that could be found in Braccus&apos; Armoury. And he went there, in the hopes of finding it... whatever it is.
We found a Purging Wand.
I was carrying out important scientific work! For Queen Justinia, at that!
&lt;i&gt;An unexpected pleasure. For both of us, I&apos;m sure.&lt;/i&gt;
Magister Grimes
Keep your distance! I recognise that particular shade of darkness in your eyes. Why do you seek me?
Source Platform
We gave Radeka&apos;s Purging Wand to Slane. We&apos;ll need to replace it.
*Ignore the painting&apos;s warning and examine it more closely.*
Name&apos;s Ruphus! Former digsite chief &apos;n&apos; archeologist. Currently a dead dwarf. At yer service.
*Say you can&apos;t describe it.*
*Sigh and say it&apos;s a hard knock life when you just can&apos;t seem to get any satisfaction out of it.*
*Accept.*
Our battle is a work in progress. I did not say all was lost! There is still time.
I found her snooping around my estate. And I don&apos;t like it when people &lt;i&gt;touch my things.&lt;/i&gt;
You are too modest. You did well. These Seekers were blind without their leader, but you returned their one-eyed king.
Low
*Staring deep into the symbol leaves you strangely dizzy.*
Harder than it ought to be, isn&apos;t it.
[JESTER] *Shake your head in sadness. That&apos;s such a terrible joke...*
That&apos;s all there is to it.
My boy talks about it all the time. &apos;One day I&apos;ll be the captain o&apos; the Lady Vengeance,&apos; he says.
You mean, like pestering Magisters while Arx all but sinks into the sea? Spare me.
*Yes, you recognise him from the ship! It would seem you&apos;re not the only one who survived the tentacles of the deep.*
Ooh, double the fun! Maybe he can teach us a thing or two while he&apos;s digging up that demon!
You cannot memorise or forget skills while in combat.
Pray to whoever you pray to that it ain&apos;t too late.
*Shake your head. Alexandar is a war criminal. He answers for his actions here and now.*
Dead, you say?
*Pay her.*
Skeletal Cat
*The warg snarls at you, the sword still protruding from its back.*
I know you for what you are: a mere mouthpiece of deception. It is of no use. The Advocate knows the tree belongs to the Ring.
*Ask if something happened between the Princess and Braccus.*
*Say that he was in league with the Black Ring, and received the end that he deserved.*
Your sins are grave, Paladin. Confess them for all to hear.
Come Alive
The Void is stronger than ever. A new Divine won&apos;t be enough. You need to go the Well of Ascension not to bathe in the Source of the Seven, but to &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; it. &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of it.
My life&apos;s work... defeated by some &lt;i&gt;nobody!&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
*Ask him why he&apos;d make that assumption.*
*Her hold tightens and slips in waves, wavering between indignation and curiosity.*
*Tell him you can kind of see the ghost&apos;s point of view.*
Daeyena plans to venture to the Blackpits and Arx and retrieve the remaining spores
*Look at her curiously. What does she mean &apos;true&apos; kin?*
The dwarven royal guard have been seen in the sewers. Strange.
*Tell her you&apos;ll do it. Who wouldn&apos;t want to see a wish granted?*
Do I look like I&apos;d fall for a trick that old? I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re under arrest!
Filthy Bonnet
*...and she fades away...*
Ear-piercer
This is the wedding day of the daughter of the merchant Ros. Her Royal Highness Justinia, the breath and balm of Duna, detailed us to protect the guests.
*Nod and say you were impressed with the quality.*
I&apos;m pleased to see you, but there is work to be done.
I&apos;ve never known friendship like that between myself and this noble creature. That&apos;s why I brought him back from death - isn&apos;t that right, Quercus? We made a pact.
The Advocate
*Interject - that deer looks Voidwoken!*
*Accept the admonishment without protest.*
Chloroform
I- I- okay. Go if you have to, but please be quick. If the Magisters even think that I&apos;m here - well, we&apos;ll all be sorry.
In this place? Short sighted.
Have you a reason for barging into my room, sir?
*Tell Zorl-Stissa she has no right to make such extravagant demands of you. You never asked for any of this.*
Because if one braves the absolute terrors of nightmare and finds sanctuary there, one is safe even from the Void.
No, it&apos;s quite, quite clear to me you are much more worthy of an honest cat&apos;s company. You just call for me, and I&apos;ll be there! All cuddles and claws, at your service!
Dialogue
*Growl.*
*The turtle nods her head sagely and tremulously turns to resume her dignified procession towards dinner.*
She&apos;s the Prime Scion. It had to be her. The other Scions knew and welcomed her: they sought out their own killer.
Applies Shocked.
[VILLAIN] *Tell him you know the set-up for a quick getaway when you see it. Ask who&apos;s in a hurry to leave...*
You... what are you &lt;i&gt;doing?&lt;/i&gt;
My love! A dream of death... No more...
One final question. Answer this correctly, and you can consider yourself a scholar on par with yours truly... fail, and I shall have to show you my door.
Large Finesse Potion
It is not wrong to walk in the camp. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; wrong to assault one walking. Only your kind does not see the difference.
It hurts, oh gods.
Report to Arran.
Do not, however, assume that every Paladin offers safe haven. The enemy of your enemy is not always a friend. Were I wearing your boots, I&apos;d seek out Arhu, the Lord Protector - and the keeper of Lucian&apos;s crypt. He is a wise one and may offer you help.
*She steps forward, slowly but confidently. She holds out her hands, palms up. They emit no fire, no ice, no curse.*
*Oink oink oink.*
A &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; betrayal.
But I&apos;d choose licking Sallow&apos;s balls over being used like a divining rod for even one more day. I started pretending I couldn&apos;t sense any more Source-based relics.
*The rumble reaches a deafening forte, then dissipates. The voice is gone. Only the whisper of the wind fills your ears.*
He is the serpent that speaks with a thousand tongues except his own. He is the death of the soul with a smile and a flourish.
*So, you say, there&apos;s a dog, and he&apos;s hungry, so he goes into a restaurant.*

Black Ring Corpse
Someone&apos;s already plucked this one.
Sad to say, but it&apos;s hard to feel bad about a demon doing as demons do.
