*His lips part. Drool trickles from his lower lip, but he speaks no words, and there is no meaning to be found in his formless throat-burbles.*
I landed on Reaper&apos;s Coast. Lone Wolf Roost Anlon is hiding here - he may know where to find the Master.
*The troll grimaces and spits a melon-sized glob of phlegm onto the ground near your feet.*
*Wait! Tell her not to listen to the voice...*
Fine. I am in no mood to argue. Now get out of here.
When enabled, the hotbar will automatically add new potions to the hotbar when you first pick them up.
Is that all you think my silence is worth? Bah!
There&apos;s food, bedding, and ash in here.
*Tell the Magister they killed an innocent man - the chef was the culprit.*
*He glances at the corpses once more. A flicker of regret registers across his spectral features.*
Mmm.
*With a flash of agonised rage, the Sallow Man backs off... and gives you a long cool look, while the torches crackle and nearby lava rumbles...*

Hell, I could&apos;ve told you that. You&apos;ll do great. By me and by my whole realm. I don&apos;t doubt that for a second.
Death stops everyone eventually. And from where I&apos;m standing, it looks like the third time&apos;s the charm...
*The elf is reading a volume of Cranley Huwbert&apos;s famous encyclopaedia. He looks up, his big, round eyes scanning your body, absorbing every detail.*
*The creature utters what might be a gasp.*
I need to dream. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; above all others. It is my vocation. My responsibility. Now more than ever.
A lovely-looking wand. For the moment, it has no magical properties. It&apos;s a very nice, straight stick though!
*Tell him yes, Lohar sent you.*
Well, I suppose you&apos;ll have to figure it all out for yourself.
Because it will be a turning point in the history of my people... but its outcome is not yet set in stone. The Empire can weather all storms, with the right guiding hand.&lt;br&gt;

Come, and look at the fruit of our union. A dragon as yet unhatched. And there are more eggs lying upon velvet cushions in my tent. Dragons-to-be, yet all too vulnerable as they lie dormant in their shells.

And where else would you have had me turn? Each path led to my sure end; this was the only one in which I could see any future at all.
*Crack your knuckles. You&apos;re going to enjoy destroying him.*

We all have secrets - do I oblige you to spill your heart to me? No, I do not. Besides...
Of course - my finest work. I drew upon everything I had for that piece - all of my skills, my experience... why, there&apos;s even my own blood and Source on that canvas.

The people must be informed at once! Princess Zenthia of the Firelands is to be &lt;i&gt;married! &lt;/i&gt;Precious prince of mine, will you see this declaration is dispersed throughout the land?

You&apos;ve given me such wonderful gifts. Your lips, your touch - and your vote of confidence. And I hope you&apos;re right. I just want my men, my women, my people - for them to be safe from Justinia&apos;s iron axe.
*That&apos;s it - the elf! He&apos;s the elf that was reading the book...*
I meant to summon an imp or two. Instead, I ended up hosting a damned arch-demon.
Seeing as it would be easy as a snap of the fingers for them to compel my co-operation by more unpleasant means, I consider myself quite lucky.
You can say what you will, guv&apos;nor, but you ain&apos;t convincing me! It&apos;s one thing to give these fellas a boost; poisoning them is quite another!

I&apos;d implore you to accept my help, Godwoken. Once it&apos;s gone, I will not have the energy to perform another feat. This is my swansong as an educator.
Ngh... let&apos;s talk about this later. I need to rest. We&apos;ve still one big jump to go, but... it&apos;ll have to wait.
Thanks again, for your help. Stay safe.
Never hurts to get your claws dirty now and then.
Ah. Hello. So much... so much you suffer. So much suffering you have &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;you make. Does causing pain stop yours?
A little leaner than when we first met, and a little less Divine than you&apos;d hoped, I imagine.
*Tell her the uncorrupted egg was, er, eaten...*
[BARBARIAN] *Give the imp face a threatening sneer.*
*The altar seems to respond. Beyond it, something creaks, as if the pipework was... moving... The sound comes from beyond the altar, but also echoes and gurgles &lt;i&gt;behind.*&lt;/i&gt;
It was foolish to leave when we did. We&apos;ve left the demon strong as he ever was.
Do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; do it again. Nobody but I can lay a finger on my darlings.
It ain&apos;t about the bloodthirst. It&apos;s about doing the right thing, not the easy thing. Not everyone gets it.
