&lt;i&gt;You?&lt;/i&gt; She sent... &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt;
[JESTER] *Say that misery&apos;s all the more reason for a hefty glug or two.*
The war was started by your hubris!
A rat begged us to help its mistress. She&apos;s imprisoned in the cells beneath the Magister barracks.

Watch. Maybe the One fights before us.

Me too...

No trouble. You&apos;re not the first, and you won&apos;t be the last.

Rhalic! What- what &lt;i&gt;happened &lt;/i&gt;to you? Did you truly fall so far?
*He looks you up and down.*
Yore no Lone Wolves. But fear not, yow&apos;re about to make this plane a better place. &lt;i&gt;Rejoice!&lt;/i&gt;
Arx would see many more long years of war.
She&apos;s very important to me, you know that! Come, let me look for her. You know I must!
*Say she can tell you the truth.*
*The younger one grows pale and his eyes open wide. The Magister that greeted you remains stiff, as if enduring a harsh wind.*
Go to the new chosen. See that he suffers. See that the God King suffers. In your name, and in &lt;i&gt;mine.&lt;/i&gt;
You stand in the way... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt; Did you really imagine your path to be settled and the way clear of strife?
*Tell him that you frankly don&apos;t give a damn.*
So much potential, but still so&lt;i&gt; naive&lt;/i&gt;. It is my very business to know things, lizard.
And you do not seem to be paying attention.
*Ask what she was doing in Arx to begin with.*
Forbidden Valley
Livewood Log
Everyone&apos;s got a past. We are who we are in this moment - that includes the &lt;i&gt;mighty Seven.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the crab to fire away.*
Then ask.
Time to find out, I guess.
Fine job with that tunnel, friend. You did a damn sight better than I did with my spoon...
I didn&apos;t say this would be easy. Nor did I say it held no risks. I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;promise that, if we succeed, we will walk free.
*Nod. He has proven himself trustworthy. In this matter, anyway.*
&lt;i&gt;Necrotic Troll.&lt;/i&gt; You are summoned. Crawl through the gate; the earth opens for thee!

Nutmeg
You should not have come. You are sworn to an enemy of mine. I cannot allow you to live. Come. Take your cure...
[IFAN] *Tell him it&apos;s as accurate a picture of war as you&apos;ve ever seen.*
It&apos;s the dwarves. They&apos;re hiding him. I know they are...
A fine sentiment. But I have nothing revelatory for you... I am as you see me.
Bottle Filled With Oil
*Nod to the fallen figure. Is he dead, or...?*
*Back away slowly.*
[DWARF] *Sing a dwarven song of triumph. Perhaps the statue will acknowledge you.*
Shrine of Braccus Rex
*Demand to know where Dallis has gone.*
Such a nuisance, the law. Quite necessary to keep the common in line, of course, but one such as myself it should exempt as a matter of course.

*Let her kiss you.*
Fascinating story, if a bit melodramatic. I imagine the pressures are getting to you. It can&apos;t be easy to be Godwoken - not in these times.
Hidden stash of the dead trader.
*Tell him to think nothing of it.*
Cold to the touch, this ornate ring once belonged to Braccus Rex. Within the band is inscribed the name Cassandra: the soul-forged twin he turned into an Undead lich to prolong his power. Indistinct, malevolent whispers issue from the stone.
Not to be worth it.

You take care now, love.
*Hesitate, then hold your other self&apos;s gaze from a safe distance.*
*Shake your head and bow low before him. Ask if the new Master is taking on apprentices.*
*Announce that you&apos;ve heard enough for now - it&apos;s time to prepare to sail.*
It was you wasn&apos;t it. You woke the ship. &lt;i&gt;Thank you&lt;/i&gt;.
Cloth Armour
Can&apos;t you name your misdeeds? Are you afraid to look them head-on?
*With delicate movements of the hands, she casts a spell, and the world around you fades.*
Light Wand
*Say that you&apos;re still curious about the murder. &lt;i&gt;Did &lt;/i&gt;he do it?*
You- you&apos;re one of them! Voidwoken walkin&apos; about like one of us!
*No. Decide against it. Even the pursuit of divinity is not worth such wanton sacrifice of life.*
*This is all a little too much drama. Take your leave.*
*Focus on the spirit&apos;s lips. You cannot hear her words - but perhaps you may still decipher them.*
I tell you what. You seem a loyal dwarf - a true servant of the kingdom. See Dorian dead, and I will meet his offer.
Oh go on! Please! You may be stupid but you don&apos;t have to be mean as well!
*Tell him you hunt and kill those belonging to the House of War.*
You know... I never was much of a solo artist. Wanna find out what comes next... you know,  together?
I will give you the space you need, then. May Lucian be your guide.
*Say that you killed the creature responsible for the decay in the region.*
True Brew: Farhangite
Watch yer &apos;ands, pipsquawk! What&apos;re ya loiterin&apos; around &apos;ere for?
I wish I was bloody *HIC!* homeless... then I&apos;d be home already! Ffnahaha! No... I was at a wedding. Buggers kicked me out - said I was causing a scene.
BABY! EGG! BABY EGG! GONE! GONE! GONE!
*Bow and apologise, saying that you wandered in by mistake and became lost. You&apos;ll be on your way now...*
Keep moving! Fast and low!
Once I would have boasted that it was the best form of government. Indeed, it was the only form of government we knew.
Care for those seeds, my friend! The powerful foster life.
Fishing from the docks in Driftwood, Lagan lost his wedding ring.
I served but the Master.
The spirit of a livewood log seeks revenge on the foreman of the mill. Only we can help it.
These are sad and dangerous times, merc, and if you think burning a man&apos;s house makes me happy, you&apos;re wrong. But someone&apos;s got to do the dirty work, and right now it falls to me... and you.
But you know it&apos;s the darkest roads that leads to light. It will be my honour to teach you.
Did she ever deal with her demons?

Same as he was at fourteen years old. Only difference is somebody gave him a bigger sword and now he&apos;s Johnny Big-Pants.

*Stay? No - you&apos;ll go clear out the Voidwoken.*
*Ask how she came to be imprisoned here.*
*Energy arcs into your fingertips, splintering across your arms and up your spine.*
&lt;i&gt;Please...&lt;/i&gt;
Someone had to give the order. And they&apos;ll have left some sign, some clue telling us who they are. They always do. The Whites are so &lt;i&gt;proud&lt;/i&gt; of their cruelty, so... &lt;i&gt;satisfied&lt;/i&gt; with themselves.
Bandit Squire
*Just before you approach the dwarf, it&apos;s as if your disguise slips away. You know he will see beyond the facade; he will know you as you are - unmasked.*
*This mundane list of duties looks to have been distributed amongst Magisters throughout Reaperâ€™s Coast.*
*The lizard looks dumbfounded. You reach into his pocket and take the drudanae; he does not resist.*
I was worried I&apos;d never see you again.
*Ask how you may be sworn.*
Corrosive Resistance
What... what is it?
Reimond,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our efforts to follow the true teachings of Lucian have taken an unlikely turn:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to save Rivellon from the evils of Source, we must first seek the aid of history&apos;s most notorious Sourcerers - Braccus Rex. The mad Sourcerer king will be able to lead us to the Aeteran, and then we can purge Source from wherever it lurks in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A captured Black Ring necromancer named Tarquin has managed to raise Braccus from his grave. As long as he remains controlled by my leash, we shall be able to use him to put our plans into motion. Once we have prevailed, we can dispose of both Braccus and the necromancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Braccus shall remain at my side. I will present him to others as &apos;Master Vredeman&apos; - a scholar and advisor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I need your assistance in keeping Vredeman&apos;s true identity a secret - our plan depends on it. Guard this information with your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D.
*He speaks, uncomfortably. She listens, her face hard and pale. &lt;i&gt;&apos;His name!&apos; &lt;/i&gt;you overhear her insist. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Roost!&apos;&lt;/i&gt; he croaks, and with that the interview&apos;s over.*
The Arcanery
In Paradise Downs, spirits spoke of a fugitive witch and her &apos;traitor&apos; companion. A powerful witch may be useful... or dangerous.

[LOHSE] *Nod. Say that you&apos;re always looking for new song material.*
What the flesh thinks does not concern us: only that it has opened our door, and is standing in the way...

Pish posh! And who&apos;ll bail them out? Seekers? Them&apos;s even worse news I reckon! Witches and warlocks they say!
Adding insult to attempted murder, the Voidwoken here call me a traitor.
And where else would you have had me turn? Each path led to my sure end; this was the only one in which I could see any future at all for the Ancient Empire.
*There&apos;s no point in trying to reason with this one - reach for your weapon...*
Somehow, you recognise the words etched upon the tablet, though you can&apos;t identify the language.
...time will tell, I&apos;m sure.
Move along, party&apos;s over.
I know. But apart from that she seemed quite nice.
[HERO] *Ask the squirrel to tell you the problem, so that you may deal with it post-haste.*
*Say you&apos;re sorry but you need to go.*
*Everything goes black.*
That is the price I paid for my genius. I was too valuable to be exposed to the dangers of the outside world. All the wars I won - and I won them all of course - I won from the comfort of sofas.
Cheap goods, or cheap loans?
You&apos;ve done more for me than any god. Let&apos;s figure out how to do this &lt;i&gt;together.&lt;/i&gt;
