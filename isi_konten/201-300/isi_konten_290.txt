May it protect you better than its last owner.
Amazing how quick things changed. When I was a lad, Lora would invite lizard dignitaries, elven seers, folk like that. Big fish from other ponds. Now, a lizard don&apos;t dare step foot in the kingdom lest some sword-lovin&apos; royalist scrape off his scales.
Good luck, Lohse. You&apos;ll certainly need it.
Lookie lookie lookie here. What&apos;s red and black and blue all over?
Clay
But... Bruno... I miss... I miss my Buddy! *Howl!*
*The dog picks up the menu, points to a glass of water.*
That&apos;s not how it works, my friend. You had the time of your life and then you got robbed. Deal with it.
Breakout!
*Claim you&apos;re a new recruit, and have been ordered to come down here without delay.*
Letter to Mordus
*You scrape your finger along the statue, and note the dust that coats it. It&apos;s haunted this tomb for some time, it seems.*
Jeroen, the Mindful One
Think anyone&apos;ll know who done it?
Pressure? It was nothing of the sort. Simply a suggestion.
*Tell the dwarf to mind his own business - you weren&apos;t talking to him.*
I wish Edderd was here. It&apos;d hearten him to see true faith in action. But instead he&apos;s out in the hellhole that is Driftwood protecting the unholy. It just isn&apos;t fair.
Marg the Troll
With a name like the trumpet of death, this book is about a plant that speaks to our imagination. Etymologically, its macabre name comes from where it used to grow: in the middle of boiling lava. This plant seems to have the ability to withstand all types of conditions. You will literally find it anywhere. If you can find it at all.
*Gareth lowers his arm and straightens his spine.*
*Say you have a very clear picture of what&apos;s going on.*
The Black House
This looks similar to that other relic I found. I wonder if it has a similar effect?
Witch&apos;s Eye
&lt;i&gt;We &lt;/i&gt;gave up Source when the Voidwoken came. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;lot didn&apos;t, and you still won&apos;t. Endtimes are here, and you still won&apos;t change your ways... now that&apos;s a sad thing.
This would never have happened under Lucian. At least not to us.
Hannag told us how she and Gwydian were forced to use Source in order to fight off the Magisters that were chasing her - this attracted Voidwoken, and ultimately led to the destruction of the Paradise Downs region.
Oh. Hey.
Helmet
&lt;i&gt;...you are here for the truth... you&apos;re not going to like it... your greatest fear come true... that you are not enough... NO YOU ARE NOT ENOUGH...&lt;/i&gt;
Bride&apos;s completely broken about it, poor thing. I ain&apos;t the comforting type, but I&apos;ve half a mind to give her a few pats on the back if it means she&apos;d quiet down.
*Tell him to go on. You love cutting down a condescending man where he stands. The more insufferable, the better.*
*Tell her about the list of Sourcerers you saw in the Magisters&apos; Barracks. Are they the Masters she means?*
*You look into your companion&apos;s face. She eagerly searches your eyes for any hint of how you must feel now that it&apos;s over; now that the Master is dead.*
The battle we fought and lost... &lt;i&gt;hmmph... &lt;/i&gt;but the war may still be won... &lt;i&gt;unnhh. &lt;/i&gt;Tovah... &lt;i&gt;gnnnr... &lt;/i&gt;Tovah is the one. &lt;i&gt;Hmmph... &lt;/i&gt;Tovah... &lt;i&gt;unnhh... &lt;/i&gt;will win the war. You&apos;ll see! We elves are not... &lt;i&gt;gaaah... &lt;/i&gt;done yet!
Igu Demonhound
No, it is enough for the creature to know that we are allowing it to accompany us so that it may act as our shield against the monsters. The Great Acorn has many servants. We shall need all the help we can get.
Used to be a school. My husband Griff and I, we taught the local kids what we could. History, politics, writing, reading. A little cooking, a little alchemy. The parents paid what they could. It was enough.
If it ain&apos;t &lt;i&gt;Francis Philosopher&lt;/i&gt;. Looks like you recovered from your existential crisis. Hope you find that wisdom you&apos;re looking for. Won&apos;t be from me.
[1] improves your casting ability of earth-based spells.
Lookie lookie lookie here!
Then what are you here for?
Decide the Voidling chick&apos;s fate.
I&apos;ll make sure that Pearst&apos;s sacrifice is recorded - he won&apos;t be forgotten.
*Ask her what&apos;s wrong - is the demon back?!*
A Treatise on Governance
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him that as a lizard prince, the tunes you know are used to control slave folk like himself. Such power is not for him to know.*
Chain Helmet
*Wait to see what happens.*
Wha- what? I don&apos;t know! I don&apos;t have much gold, but I&apos;ve spent years collecting rare items from across Rivellon.
*She closes her eyes and starts chanting in a low, inscrutable language. Her voice changes, dipping into a register lower than you thought possible. Her eyes roll back in her head and she starts to shake.*
But! I suppose I might be swayed to forgiveness by the other little Godwoken morsels you&apos;ve brought me...
That means there is but one place we can go: the Well of Ascension.
Indeed. And if my younger self had welcomed evil into my life, I&apos;d deserve a swift beheading too.
*Ask what he means. What mistake?*
Every approach blocked... d-damn it, what good are battle tactics against those &lt;i&gt;things &lt;/i&gt;anyway...?
The world was at peace.
Cook&apos;s orders. If you have a problem with that, you can talk to her yourself. Predictably, she&apos;s in the kitchen.
*Apologise.*
Just say the word and I&apos;ll summon a flood large enough to end this - all of this - once and for all. We&apos;ll have to make haste afterward, though; the demon will know what we&apos;ve done in an instant. He&apos;ll want to tear us to shreds for what we&apos;ll do.
Increased Magical Armour, reduced Physical Armour.
*Sigh.* I only wanted to give you &lt;i&gt;rest&lt;/i&gt;, not pain. Now I leave you to my children. They are many. They are impatient. They lack my gentle touch...
*Tell her if she doesn&apos;t kiss you, now, you&apos;re going to explode.*
T-there&apos;s a few Seekers who could help you there... take your pick.
*Hold out a gold piece. Allow him to take it.*
*The soldier tightens his grip on his spear and looks past you.*
Bloody rebels. Them heretics deserve everything they get.
*Lucian frowns at Vredeman, then bestows a benevolent smile upon you. All that you know of him flashes across the panorama of your mind.*
We are beyond help. There is only pain.
This floral-scented potion is commonly called &apos;King&apos;s Pal&apos;. It grants its drinker a gentle resistance to poisoning.
RrrrrRUFF!
We&apos;re swirlin&apos; the drain. If someone doesn&apos;t plug it, we&apos;ll slip down, easy as you please.
*Once, you had no match in Rivellon&apos;s skies. You ruled over your lessers until age ravaged you into obscurity.*
*You&apos;ll speak of love later. Whisper that you want to taste her first.*
The new custodians of the Deathfog tried to recruit the Sourcerer Hannag to make them a Deathfog delivery device.
I can sense something here... this is it, Lohse...
Who asked you? You&apos;re not even supposed to be down here!
Maybe I have. Maybe I haven&apos;t. I might never know.
What did they do to me?
Karma
Thank you, lizard lady. Now if you don&apos;t mind we&apos;re busy waiting for our friend.
Here. Strike true. And let us see what awaits me...
Someone, help!
Champion of Fort Joy
[JESTER] *Giggle, and tell him you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;dying&lt;/i&gt; to know what it is.*
Spirit of Beast
What kind of trick are you trying to pull? You just earned yourself a ticket to a prison cell.
*Sigh* You&apos;re right. It doesn&apos;t matter now - what&apos;s done is done.
*The Scion eats the lizard&apos;s heart, one chamber at a time. One. Two. Three. And then it is gone. She holds her hand out...*
*He bows his head, and vanishes into the ether.*
Why don&apos;t you stick your b-b-beak out into that cave and see?
Oh, very good. Very, very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good.
*Inform Exter you managed to find a wand that will see the Shriekers dead.*
*Move a little closer to him.*
Block
Looks like you&apos;ve had some technical difficulties, eh?
That&apos;s nice, Mother.
Exploration Theme 11 Light
*Wonder what he learned.*
*Remark that Grbbt seemed to miss her.*
The Shadow Prince explained that the Ancestor Trees pose a grave threat to the wider world.
[OUTLAW] *Say you don&apos;t keep track of every fop and priss in the land.*
*You feel the boards creak under your boots; the smell of salt and pitch fills your nose. You check the knots securing your cargo, hands moving over rough rope in the darkness.*
*Tell him you already killed the man he seeks, but you won&apos;t participate in this mission of revenge.*
Not being human, you don&apos;t seem the type, no. The answer to your question is, unsurprisingly, a man in a house. A man in a house buys all the Void-tainted fish I can send him.
*A flicker of pain appears on the Magister&apos;s face before he regains his composure.*
So, no home. Except... everywhere, really.
*Tap... tap...TAP... tap-tap-tap... &lt;i&gt;CRACK.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit shivers and shimmies - and then is gone, lost to nothingness, its Source now lurking within you.*
*She mutters to herself breathlessly, all but oblivious to your presence.*
Do not trust your eyes alone, for only questions asked by the blade will reveal the truth.
A vote is currently in progress. Please await the results (or timeout in [1] seconds).
*Sigh* Don&apos;t I know it.
*She smiles and quizzically tilts her head.*
(I hope so. Shhh, he&apos;ll hear us!)
&apos;The Rakish Armour of Lord Ruaney: He Whose Footsteps Never Touch Ground.&apos;
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Ask if she knows where the thieves hang out.*
High Quality Tormented Soul
Ah, I&apos;d presumed you&apos;d like to stop and smell the roses for a bit. I won&apos;t take up more of your time, then. Farewell.
The same way I do everything, of course: demonic guile. It seems I might&apos;ve rubbed off on you more than I would&apos;ve liked.
When you have people like that around you, you know - a &lt;i&gt;family &lt;/i&gt;- even rain feels like sunshine.
Naught wrong? Reds say jump and they ask how high! Naught wrong, she says! Blimey! A disgrace is what it is!
*Say you will fight to claim your place as the champion.*
*Roll your eyes. It&apos;s not a scenic spot, but they may as well be sitting about having a picnic.*
*Say you&apos;d like to ask him a few questions, if he wouldn&apos;t mind.*
*Describe to her everything you saw and heard in the Hall of Echoes.*
&lt;i&gt;&apos;Optimism is a moral imperative.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; But I think you&apos;ve moved beyond optimism and into madness!
Blessed branches, Quercus. Of course they believe it!
You sang the song. Now you must decide my fate. Are you to be my new mistress?
You fret so much about others. I do hope one day you&apos;ll learn to let go and think of yourself. Let me show you what comes next:
You have my apologies, lizard.
Then it looks like you ain&apos;t leavin&apos;.
Troubled Waters
You pretend to be a prince of the House of War, whereas you&apos;re nothing but a slave of the House of Shadows!
Amadia basks in the cool light of the Moon.
Scarecrow&apos;s Wail
Make it quick!
When the dust settled,
*Recognition flashes in her eyes, then sorrow.*
They... they &lt;i&gt;executed &lt;/i&gt;him.
*Turn away.*
*She seems to seize you by the arms, but you feel nothing. Her face is panicked. Her lips move, but still no sound comes out.*
Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more, but you lack conviction. You remain closed. So too the doors.
*Attack him.*
Let the reputation and skill of your whole party help when you want to haggle for the best prices!
* - and then they are gone.*
