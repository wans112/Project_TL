I tore at the shackles that kept me chained to the floor; iron thick as a smith&apos;s wrists. Of course they wouldn&apos;t budge - they never did before - but now, now that I saw the light, something welled up inside me: a raw and undeniable burst of power.

And take it you must, for I am a goddess no longer: robbed of my powers by the usurping Divine!

We found ourselves at odds, that much cannot be denied. All because of who you are, and all because of who &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; is.

Zapor retrieved all of his armour and was ready to ambush us inside the shipwreck.
Look... just... I know it was bad, ok? I know. You don&apos;t have to tell me.
Black Ring Assassin
You be careful now! What&apos;s under there smells &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;bad. It smells... &lt;i&gt;evil.&lt;/i&gt;
Gods!
Lady Paulina Kemm let slip that her husband kept his bedroom locked. The bedroom leads to the attic...
Master was a lizard. She sent us here. Me and Ma and Pa. She was not a nice lady. Lizards aren&apos;t nice ladies.
[MYSTIC] *Suggest that perhaps she still feels her child&apos;s spirit.*
*Command her to let you go this instant! Who the hell does she think she is attacking you like that?*
Door&apos;s over there. Convention says you go up alone. See you in a couple of minutes then? Ha!
*A warm hand grips your shoulder, and you turn to see... Gareth&apos;s face. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Brothers in Lucian, forever. I promise.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; But you don&apos;t believe him.*
But that was just my ego. That wasn&apos;t really me. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is me. Saving Lucian for the world is my true calling. That and killing Seekers. Same thing, really.
*The other Paladin rolls his eyes and shakes his head as he turns to face you.*

We can&apos;t be wastin&apos; time. The Empress will have me head, and then all of yers!
*Muse that the Deathfog won the war, a war that could not be lost.*
*He steps forward and lowers his voice to a harsh whisper.*
Oh, I&apos;ll make you pay, alright. With your life!
Whatever it is, lizard, I&apos;m not interested. Good day to you.

On Lizards&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Cranley Huwbertâ€™s description of the lizards begins and ends with the Houses of War, Law, and Dreams, and tells great tales of physical perfection, intellectual rigour, and the importance of bloodlines in the middle. He also tells what he believes to be a tall tale about dragons. He finds lizards impressive indeed, but not to a draconic extent.*
Oh, precious. You walk in his own home and know him not? Wouldn&apos;t I like to be a fly on the wall when he catches &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;in his web!
We saved the tree from its torment.

I&apos;d tell you to take it up with Big Marge, but she&apos;s... quite dead.
There are more Masters of the Source, more aspects of the Source to learn. Your hunt continues, Ifan.
Your inner demon actively watches over you. When an enemy approaches in melee range, they will be pummelled by a demonic fist dealing physical damage.
*Explain your cause, and politely request that she lift the feathers&apos; curse.*
You can do this.
What the hells just happened?
*Tell her you have demons of your own, though they don&apos;t possess you in quite the same way.*
*Hand him Jonathan&apos;s ring as proof of death.*
We entered a large and potentially dangerous cavern.
Divine Prelate
Ah, a lively one: generous and high-spirited?
That thing isn&apos;t Donna. It isn&apos;t ANYBODY. It&apos;s a monster, pure and simple. All of them are.
*The guard makes a low, guttural sound.*
Don&apos;t let most elves hear you say that. I&apos;m only half an elf, thank the heavens. Or rather, thank the &lt;i&gt;hells&lt;/i&gt;, if you catch my meaning.
Until then, we persist as we must.
*Wave him away.*
The God King ascended to Divinity. This can&apos;t be good.
[DWARF] *Say you&apos;re just another dwarf, a long way from home. You mean her no harm.*
Xantezza, goddess of imps, mirth and laughter.&lt;br&gt;Something tells me she&apos;s not laughing now.
*The dog raises its head to the stormy sky and howls. The earth beneath you vibrates - a dirge plucked on the strings of a rotting lute.*
You are no mere mortal - you are one of us. You could become the &lt;i&gt;Eternal &lt;/i&gt;Divine.
*No. You&apos;ll tear the secrets from his sallow spirit. Send the Sallow Man to his maker.*
Home&apos;s home.
*...and you realise you hear the music too... an old ballad from the Empire... it pulls at the heartstrings, every time...*
[BARBARIAN] *Grunt that he&apos;s nothing but a parchment-tickler. Whatever he&apos;s read in these books isn&apos;t worth a thing in the real world.*
[SEBILLE] *You smile, but not sincerely. There will be war, yes, but let it end there.*
Forktongue&apos;s aura deflects any damage inflicted to his allies, sending it back where it came from.
Spirit of Captain Ablewether
*There are &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; in this unnatural darkness. They slither behind you so quickly; more quickly than you.*
We should be careful, but let&apos;s not get paranoid. We can trust our friends.
*Mewl...*
*The hatch is blocked tight by the high drifts of sand carpeting the floor.*
But... let&apos;s talk about those old days another time.
Never underestimate the power of a good sleep! Simply use the bedroll at any non-combat time to resurrect your dead allies.
So you say.
*Aglow with flames and glistening slime, the strange beast looks at you almost... expectantly.*
*Say that you were always fond of her and took pleasure in her worship. You&apos;d rather restore &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; godhood than assume your own.*
*Ask her what exactly will take her.*
B-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A! *snort*
Brave and steadfast, the Seeker Gareth is a natural leader and veteran of battlefields throughout Rivellon.

Bad dog!
*He lunges towards you, just as the hanging Sourcerer breaks free of his bond.*
*You feel your spirit jolt, and for a heartbeat you&apos;re looking through other eyes. You see a dungeon and a table shared with two other skeletons before you collapse.*
I&apos;d say we should stop to talk, but I&apos;m swamped! Heehee.
Well, more&apos;s the damn pity, isn&apos;t it?
*Quietly let her tell her tale.*
Looks like this place has been sealed up for a century or two.
*Though your spell tore through him like a spear through flesh, Rhalic looks grimly happy - if haggard.*
[ELF] *Frown. Does that mean... this is a livewood ship?*
Quite sure. Now, I can hardly be held under suspicion for being &lt;i&gt;enlightened&lt;/i&gt;, wouldn&apos;t you agree?
*She taps a finger against her forehead.*
There&apos;s a princess here in Arx, your highness, and her skin is as red as yours. These are the words she bid me tell you:
There&apos;s no time for details! I&apos;ll show you everything, I swear - but &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt;, help me get out of here first!
*Grab her in a big bear hug.*
She is immensely powerful, and she &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;on our side, but she will not be pleased about... well, my parting.
Cursed! No wonder it doesn&apos;t work...
Doesn&apos;t change the fact that I blew your mind last night, either.
Shackling
*Praise the dog for loving his master, but tell him his master&apos;s &apos;love&apos; is conditional on his devotion. He must be a good dog, but his master does not have to be a good master.*
Crafting Bible, Part VI
I chose peace. Were it the only option we ever faced, the world could be - would be - so very different.
*Say that if she tells you what she knows, you&apos;ll give her remains a proper burial.*
Then it&apos;s settled.
*At first, you might think the figure is a simple stone statue, but it bears no chisel marks, no uneven surfaces, no signs of polishing. This is a petrification victim.*
We are rallying into position. The Magisters will fall.
I know we can&apos;t stay here. The Magisters... they&apos;ll come back. They always do.
*A slow, toothless smile stretches across her face.*
I think not. Pay up, cuckoo.
[JESTER] *Tell him he looks great. Ask if he&apos;s lost weight.*
They&apos;re... t-they&apos;re dead... and for what?
The skeleton has been killed. So much for his philosophy.
Wrong answer. Guards...

It has been a hard journey to godhood. I am no champion. But I may yet be a hero and earn the powers of the Gods.
Spirit of the Blind Guide
Maybe if you consider the Hall of Echoes a place of safety... you know this is a very &lt;i&gt;specific &lt;/i&gt;kind of delivery device, right? Specifically, for delivering Deathfog.
*He&apos;s sleep-talking. It&apos;s gibberish. Leave him be.*

A delicate filigree chain from which dangles an innocent charm.
*Ponder her words and ask what&apos;s in it for you.*
*You&apos;re standing in the tavern&apos;s kitchen, hunched over a table as the chef shows you her haul. Tools, seized Source recipes, and the blade you recognise as a Magister&apos;s handiwork.*
We&apos;re waiting for Joe.
*The cat opens his mouth as if to speak, but his eyes lose focus and with a jerk he turns away from you.*
*Smile. Tell him he looks like a good man, and he knows a reward is the right thing to do.*
When the Voidwoken came, she ran off in the direction of the Cloisterwoods. It&apos;s true - she&apos;s a dear spirit. Just... pushed too far, y&apos;know?
*Wheezes become a hum, then a gently wavering song.*
Well, now. It seems you know the exact price for my silence! Let&apos;s just go about our business then.
*Say it brings you no pleasure, but you must kill her. She almost brought the whole of Arx to its knees.*
*Again the statue takes you...*

Lohar trusts you, lady. Don&apos;t disappoint him.
I can&apos;t move my fingers... they&apos;re frozen!
A dark presence comes.&lt;i&gt; It must never sing the Taming;&lt;/i&gt; the hymnals must be destroyed! Yet I see no sign one was ever here.

Thankee kindly. Any chance of another one? Penny for a sick dog and all that?
*Shake your head. One should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; bargain with creatures of the dark.*
*Hesitate before saying you&apos;re not sure what she means.*
*As strong as Aetera was weak, the pedestal seems empty, as it if once supported something - something &lt;i&gt;powerful.&lt;/i&gt; You surmise that this was once the resting place of the Aeteran - until it was torn free, and borne away.*
