To the Honourable Lord Kemm,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As requested, my attentions have been devoted to the Magisters, and scarcely have they faltered. My Lord, it is as you say: Dallis has been keeping the company of an unusual advisor by the name of Vredeman. I do not think, however, that this advisor is merely tutor or teacher, but an instrument of war. I have seen displays of his spite and strength against even Dallis&apos; own Magisters on a number of occasions, and I have never known any soul to muster such advanced Sourcery - not even Lucian himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dallis surely means to exploit this Vredeman&apos;s expert command of the Source. I&apos;d suggest it prudent to avoid direct confrontation with any Magister with Vredeman near until we better understand the breadth of his mastery and the Magisters&apos; core intentions. It&apos;s a troubling development; the balance of power within the Divine Order is shifting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Vishlar&lt;br&gt;
You&apos;ve got gumption, I&apos;ll give you that. But someone as dishonest as you deserves only one fate: death.
*She looks from you to the Magisters and back again.*

*Turn on your heel; you won&apos;t be spoken to like this.*
*You drink, and it&apos;s magnificent: a taste that is warm and sensuous, like a prelude to ecstasy spreading itself through your veins.*
*Tell him you&apos;re not here to make a deal, and turn heel.*
You must go your path; I mine, so that I may confront the arch-demon in his lair, in the great city of Arx.
There&apos;s a reason I don&apos;t wear Order garb anymore. But I... I don&apos;t like to talk about those days.

I... don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t know! Oh Duna&apos;s beard, &lt;i&gt;Lohar&lt;/i&gt;. My b-b-boss Lohar will want to know what happened to them, but I... I can&apos;t remember.

Simone tried her best to tend to the casualties.

Tell me: what is your strategy in battle? You may have lost, but your talent is clear.
Ruse? I took only what I asked for, and gave you the gift I promised.
I am in Fort Joy, but I do not see you there. From the Fort I escape, as you do.
*Find me on the Nameless Isle at the temple of Zorl-Stissa. In the presence of the goddess, let War and Shadow meet.*
At the point of our escape from the island, we were intercepted by Alexandar. We defeated him.
*He grabs a metal plate and watches his reflection with one eye as the other shifts left to right and up to down. He repeats the manoeuvre with the opposite eye.*
*Tell her never to mind: you&apos;re not interested in arrows.*
*Say that Lohse would never harm him, but he doesn&apos;t have to talk to her anymore.*
Now please, run along. I have a world to decipher.
He&apos;s probably run off to that house of his. Over by the barracks.
Well, that&apos;s that sorted! Onward then: I&apos;ve got to get out of here - and &lt;i&gt;soon &lt;/i&gt;- and I suppose you do, too.
*The candle is out.*
Patrolling Boots
Figured as much.
The world as we know it will soon come to an end, and welcome an undead wasteland in its stead.
The sick young woman attacked us. Swann will study her remains to find out what ailed her.
*Sniff.* Thanks. You&apos;re nice.
Oh, friend, now she&apos;ll never be quiet.
FREE! FREE! Mmm, and how hungry I&apos;ve grown.
Speak to the Paladin loremaster.
Magisters and Paladins alike are here to see Alexandar ascend. The Black Ring opposes them. There may be trouble ahead...

*As you reach to push open the heavy door, the coils and whorls of engraved wood dance into a new pattern. The semblance of a face arises. A face that seems to look right &lt;i&gt;through &lt;/i&gt;you.*
*The spirit of a dwarf guard patrols the garden, oblivious to the fact that he&apos;s dead.*
*The dwarven woman wrings her hands as she examines a contraption that looks broken beyond repair. Her ears twitch at your approach, but she does not turn to you.*
Umbral Statue
I will whisper where your former master lurks. I will smooth that scar right off your face.
You will pay for your crimes!
*No. You saw what happened the last time you allowed her &apos;a word&apos;.*
I studied the tablet that you so generously provided... it showed me everything I need to know about creating a functional Swornbreaker. Once I have that, I&apos;ll be free of the Covenant, and free to spend the rest of my days with Mihaly.
I am the Lady&apos;s Godwoken, the last hope of my people. I am to compete for Divinity with the champions of the other lord-gods.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
&lt;i&gt;And I shall take it away.&lt;/i&gt;
I owe you my freedom. I will see that you make it to the Nameless Isle.

*Tell the gruesome creature to watch its tone, or you&apos;ll quench its flames for good.*
Carve and chisel a piece of rock; Drown it in ale to make it talk; Enchant it with dust to call forth; The rock rune&apos;s powers from the earth.

I stand corrected. It is in the revelation that you show your upper hand...
&lt;b&gt;She is ours, body and spirit.&lt;/b&gt;

We paid a price. They took poor Royceston with them. His screaming haunts me still.
Of course you are. The Spouse of the Sun. The Red Prince, and so much more...
So... where were we?
Go in peace. Enjoy your freedom. The sun. The breeze.
I was wondering when I&apos;d see you again. Knew the time would come after you broke daddy&apos;s leash.

Blessed Poison
*Tell her you&apos;re still looking around.*
I can think of a few people, places, and things that could do with a... &lt;i&gt;fresh &lt;/i&gt;start. Seems pretty handy to me.
True. After all, it&apos;s not like I just got my voice back after a demon&apos;s been holding it hostage...
Heh, knew it! Damned fool...
*He arches an eyebrow and takes two more steps towards you.*
Here&apos;s twenty or so noble gentlemen. No-one knows what they did wrong - if anything! And she has &apos;em stripped and whipped all the way to the execution grounds. Didn&apos;t even give &apos;em the dignity of the sword, no ma&apos;am! Had &apos;em all hung. Reeeal slow like.
She found a god other than herself? I&apos;ll believe it when I see it. Her sins are so much darker than ours. She used to laugh as she recounted her deeds...

Hmm. I owe you, so I&apos;ll tether the boat a while longer. But... &lt;i&gt;hurry&lt;/i&gt;. It isn&apos;t safe to stay here long.
