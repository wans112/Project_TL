To be Godwoken is all well and good, but above all I&apos;ve yet to find the Master.
*Hannag? Tell Lyn you met her not too long past. She was set upon by Magisters, but together you made short work of them.*
A long recovery ahead, but better than the alternative...
Still in cooldown&lt;br&gt;
Get out of here. I can barely stand the sight of you.
Oil Flask
As per your own testimony, you can tailor, but you have the taste buds of a dung beetle, and your personal hygiene reminds one of a carcass rotting in the sun.
An ancient amulet that contains five jewels ready to be infused with Source; each blessed with a kiss of Astarte. Oddly enough, the sides and face of the amulet look worn...
When the War of the Demons began, the stalwart dwarves stood by the Divine.
The Academy of the Seven
*Say you seek your own destiny. Let each dwarf map her own.*
*Cast your eye around and ask if this is where the Magisters kept the Seeker prisoners locked up.*
You saved my best Paladins by the skin of their teeth. The lads are brave, but they&apos;re no match for Voidwoken, &apos;specially right off the back of chasing down Magisters.
Oh... a change of... of plans. Right. On your way then. Nice meeting you.
Magister Bow
*Scratch your noggin. Did he know his daughter&apos;s betrothed asked you to kill him?*
*Tell him he doesn&apos;t have the bearing of a Lone Wolf.*
I can definitely hear the catch of a lock...
Sting me again and a sting I&apos;ll return, as virulent as the cobra&apos;s!
Are you sure you want to destroy: [1]?&lt;br&gt;Destroyed items are lost forever!
It laughed as I was sealed away in that lamp. &apos;Be the &lt;i&gt;light of the world&lt;/i&gt;, Godwoken.&apos; it said. Even so, it was more honest than your hellish Seven.
You shall learn all that you need to know. Show patience...
I know you agree.
Nameless Character
*Tell her she gets a ticket to the circus and all the free sweets she can eat.*
*The demon has been defeated at last... but the fellow he possessed had to be sacrificed, too.*
*You can see the spirit suppress a shudder. Ask what she&apos;s talking about.*
These look curiously familiar...
That&apos;ll be the regular toll, so. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
Vanquish the Gods. End them forever.
*She laughs.*
Only users in Wireless mode can connect
Doesn&apos;t not... not... not...
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for something a little more... adventurous.*
Storage Room
You animal. Get out of here. And don&apos;t expect no money back neither.
Good gods, but that was fun! Let&apos;s find that thing and do it again.
Ball and Chain
But more surprises — and difficult choices — awaited.
Dust Blast Scroll
I wish I knew. Would love to be in the Hall with the rest of my kin. But I&apos;m a man o&apos; action, not magic.
*Ask what she&apos;s doing...*
Harsh times require harsh measures.
*An ancient curse escapes from his lips, spoken so forcefully that for a brief moment all light recedes into the webs of darkness.*
No work. I do it cuz I like it. Don&apos;t cause trouble. Just dig and pluck weeds and shoo the ravens.
*&apos;The Lone Wolves kill my daughter. Our Scion. The Lone Wolves must pay.&apos;*
Lich
*To your surprise they next lie down on the ground in a seemingly warm embrace and fall asleep.*
Now then. The epic of &lt;i&gt;The Master and the Scar&lt;/i&gt;. Sounds like a melodramatic opera.
Time to get to the point.
I didn&apos;t know demons could feel nervous. Amazing.
There is no cure! There&apos;s only pain - please. Make it stop. I don&apos;t want  to go like. Please...
*Say you&apos;ve seen Dallis herself at work. &lt;i&gt;No-one &lt;/i&gt;is safe here.*
*Ask if this is where Lohse will go, if the demon succeeds in overtaking her.*
*He inches closer to you, so close that you can feel the heat of his body warming you. You can smell his scent: wild and animalistic.*
*Ask if she has you mistaken for someone else.*
*Tell her... him... it... you&apos;re only too happy to help.*
So I can see. You&apos;ve learned a lot; you can control a vast quantity of Source already.
Please, speak.
No road quite so wonderful as the road untravelled.
[VILLAIN] *He&apos;s unarmed. Good time to kill him.*
*You remember drinking ruby wine with Magister Borris in the armoury after-hours. You remember his deep hazel eyes, how he trembled as he kissed you. You remember all of it, the best night of your life.*
*Finish the sentence with &apos;very awful, rotten.&apos;*
Abilities
Are you proud of all you achieved?
*Gareth bows low, and looks to you with a wide smile as he rises.*
Say nuthin&apos; to no-one, but I&apos;m doin&apos; Lohar&apos;s good work too. I&apos;ll be helpin&apos; the pallies here with their uprisin&apos; in Arx.
*The deer bows its head in thanks, licking its chops all the while.*
It pains me to say, but you&apos;ve talents in the adventuring department that I do not. And this heirloom could prove valuable. For both of us.
*The salamander turns away from you with a hiss and a wheeze.*
I&apos;m afraid that ship has sailed, Lohse. I won. It&apos;s too late. You know that, don&apos;t you? Of course you do - you &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;it.
But me? I have a contract to sever. And if you&apos;re so eager to be at your King&apos;s side, then I am &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than happy to see it done - &lt;i&gt;here and now.&lt;/i&gt;
As am I.
Never was known for her patience, was she? If you&apos;re taking this run, the kid&apos;ll have to go with you. Feisty one, too. Liable to jump into the canal if you don&apos;t watch him close.
Reanimate Dead
City Guard Sniper
*Gears turn behind the ancient walls, almost like they&apos;re acknowledging the words you spoke.*
How the wind moves their hair... if only they were alive to feel it.
This large-sized, strength-enhancing brew still smells of the troll whose sweat grants it its magical properties.
Good luck on the Path of Blood, pilgrim. I hope you&apos;re truly free from sin.
Thank you! And I&apos;m sorry, but you do look it. I call it as I see it.
True enough.
The Supernatural Masquerade
Stow your weapons.
Rousing rabble is what I do best. Now, to stay out of Magister hands long enough to cause a &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;commotion.
Nothing. Not for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
Beer Barrel
You will meet him soon. Him and others, hidden far away.
It&apos;s too late for want. All you are is what you are.
Oh, I just love when random adventurers come to play hero. It&apos;s almost like they think fairy-tales are &lt;i&gt;real!&lt;/i&gt;
Got two of ma own, haven&apos;t I?
Pumpkin Peel
Ship&apos;s Manifest
Zombie Talk
Sodden Diary
*She eagerly returns your kiss, and just like that of the goddess, it is long and sweet as rosewater.*
*Take your leave.*
Now - fair horizons to you.
I am Sadha, princess of the House of Law. And you: you interrupt the destined union between the Red Prince and the Red Princess.
Browbeaten people allow all kinds of terrible things... until they realise &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; have the power to change them.
*Leave it be.*
Still, it&apos;s what&apos;s on the inside that counts - isn&apos;t that right? And this is the place you&apos;re meant to become a god. I can&apos;t help but wonder exactly what you intend to do with such a power.
Godsda&apos;it! A &apos;aster &apos;aze-&apos;uilder doesn&apos;t give away the king&apos;s secrets! &apos;y lihs are sealed. &apos;y lihs. I&apos;ll say nothing, I &apos;ean.
*Ask what&apos;s wrong.*
Just look at you! Never saw an ugly mark like that on a pretty face like yours. Bet you hate the fella that put it there!
Griff described his stolen goods. That should help.
You may be Godwoken, but that doesn&apos;t make you worthy.
&lt;i&gt;What?!&lt;/i&gt; I serve with utter loyalty, now and forever! Now get away from me, and don&apos;t come back unless you have information I can use!
*The tree&apos;s spirit embraces its putrid host. An ancestor, lost to the same demonic disease that infests all of Bloodmoon Island.*
&lt;i&gt;These were sacrifices that had to be made. You were but one. Each of them pains me, but... I would make them all again. I made so... many... sacrifices... Ifan...&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him he&apos;s dead.*
We &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; redeem Rivellon! No longer will you and your divine ambitions stand in our way!
Go on, Saam.
*Slide up close and squeeze the back of his neck ever so slightly. How about now?*
Adventure
*Clouds of ash batter you and flames lap at your feet, but you stand strong. It&apos;s all a trick of the mind.*
Then an elf would know whose flesh she&apos;s supposedly consumed. Do you know?
Perhaps you&apos;re right. There&apos;s no sense in risking more Magister lives if the Voidwoken will kill him for free... very well, we&apos;ll call off the search!
Just one thing at a time I guess. First, I go back to the kingdom, see the queen. There&apos;s a lot to do there. Damage that needs undone. Dwarves&apos;ve lived in fear for too long, on the outside &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the inside.
We found Tarquin locked in Dallis&apos; cabin. An odd man in many respects, he claimed to have been her prisoner.
Duna&apos;s grace, I hope boss understands...
*Ahem*. Go on then. Show me what she taught you.
Not yet. But if Lord Kemm says to search, I&apos;m going to search.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Tell them you have more than enough to keep the Path Keeper pleased.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
*His whiskers crack into a mischievous smile.*
Whatever it is, it looks dangerous.
It&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;important matter that I locate this Migo. Tell me if you hear mention of him.
He has a date with a needle.
Question Amyro.
But I&apos;m on duty here, sir. There are rocks ahead and Ablewether must know&apos;t!
Pot Helm
You expect me to swallow that? I&apos;ll see you choke on your lies!
Door
And then I took her place. It didn&apos;t take long to realise that Lucian was the key to my vengeance - and I was the key to the salvation of Rivellon.
*Say that dwarves give you a rash, but you usually have the decency to keep that to yourself.*
[IFAN] *Quote the late Divine. &apos;Blessed are the charitable, for they will receive in kind.&apos;*
[ELF] *Reach for your weapon. Scion or no, she is lost.*
*Dismiss her question and ask who this &apos;Lord&apos; of hers is.*
*Look at him in surprise. Really? He&apos;s having fun?*
Great. Can I have it then? Please?
A potion that restores your vitality. It makes a soft tinkling sound when you shake it.
Find Griff.
Retrieve the teleportation gloves.
If he can survive our hunt, he can survive the Dunes. I won&apos;t have him sneaking back in the night to take another life. We search until we find him!
I - I mean - I just rather wish - um...
*Spying some blood on the owl&apos;s beak, you pry it open to investigate. Inside, you see a human finger.*
Bearing a Cocoon
*Ask if these revelations jogged anything in her memory.*
Annihilate
*These other lizards, ask what they looked like.*
*Tell it to tell you how to get to the Well.*
Gated Crypt
add status effect
The Forgotten and the Damned
The Red Prince was once more waylaid by House of Shadows assassins.
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry to hear of the loss of a family heirloom.*
*Ask him to wait. You may have spoken in haste, but you&apos;re not sure yet what the right thing to do is.*
[BEAST] *Admit it. You have committed many sins in your time.*
Improvised Shovel
*Tell her &apos;spoiled milk&apos;.*
Exploration Theme 11 Mystic B
The Shadow Prince used Deathfog on the Mother Tree. In one fell swoop the past and future of the elves was destroyed.
Exquisite! Magnificent! A stirring display of violence. Although an equally unfortunate display of curiosity.
