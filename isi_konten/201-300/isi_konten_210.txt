*Say you&apos;re interested in trade.*
Can nothing harm this horror?
Next Level [1]: +[2]% Physical Armour.
Restore the Physical Armour and Magic Armour of your shield.
Move along.
Report back to the Advocate.
Sure. It&apos;s nothing really.
*Tell her you found their eggs, but they&apos;ve been transformed into Voidwoken.*
Pigskin Gloves
Got a good one goin&apos; on as we speak!
But you...
Oh come no, surely you must have heard of the Gallery! Why, it&apos;s the repository for the Godwoken tomes!
We ventured on without pursuing the matter further.
Would you mind awfully procuring for us a small potion that Alice Alisceon keeps in her cellar? We&apos;d rather like to, you know, assume our rightful forms and... toddle off. Thanks ever so.
*Argue that a small, vulnerable child is a limited vessel. A more mature host would give the demon greater options.*
Oh. Okay.
*He slowly drops to his knee, his torso quaking and his jaw clenched.*
No, please don&apos;t get cross. This is too important!
*Comment that it seems like whatever&apos;s in her head doesn&apos;t like music.*
Desert Sand
[MYSTIC] *Look closer. Her stillness is not a calm one. She waits for someone, something.*
*The heat and ash dissipate. Were it not for the glowing orb in your hand, there would be no proof of the vision at all.*

Do you know me?
*Say he has mistaken you for someone else and ask after the dwarf he&apos;s talking about.*
I never said it was without risk, stranger! You seem to have survived the effects of the fish, and I have learned a great deal!
A bow of Dwarven origin from which arrows fly true and hurt plenty.
*The spirit looks at you regretfully.*
*Say you&apos;re looking for a ranger who can dabble into the arcane arts - a Wayfarer.*
My soul jar is almost in my grasp. With Source and blood, the fount will flow and the reliquary will open!
He does? Damn it! We can&apos;t risk him setting it off here - half of Driftwood would go up in flames...
Die, assassin!
Madam, please do hold still.
You won&apos;t put a Source collar on me, Dallis! I&apos;m a big bad evil Sourcerer and I&apos;ll kill you dead!
I&apos;m Lohse. Pleased to meet you.
*Ask about the arena.*
If we don&apos;t have &lt;i&gt;order&lt;/i&gt; here, we won&apos;t even survive long enough to get cured by the Reds. Surprised you lent a hand. Well done.
The man that walked out of here is not the son we knew. Be brave, for both of you.
Warm Hold
*The ghost swivels his head back to the sea-captain. The bell rings on.*
*Ask the crab how it came by its Source powers.*
Birds Deep Forest 01
&lt;i&gt;...good evening... my prince... i trust you sleep well...&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s shit.
Back again, eh? Looking for anything in particular?
Scene Folder
*Take your leave.*
*His sneer is now a gash, wide and gruesome. You can barely believe one spirit could harbour so much contempt.*
Firebrand Scroll
Given how well you handled yourself in Fort Joy, I rather think you could be of use. And I am certainly useful to you.
A... child. An innocent life. This beast must die.
*Note the mutilated Magisters - what had he done?*
Saheila... no...
*Deep silence echoes within.*
*You have reached your wits&apos; end. Consume his Source.*
Eternal Artefact
Is that... an elven ancestor tree just ahead? It&apos;s... beautiful.
Autopack
Eternal Protector
*With a last suspicious look, Mordus hunches over and hurries away.*
Blind
Cursed Widow
Always business to take care of. Say, you were on the ship here with me, weren&apos;t you?
And if it was important, odds are it was &lt;i&gt;extremely &lt;/i&gt;dangerous.
*Ask what&apos;s going on in there, beyond the gate.*
Something isn&apos;t right. The ring&apos;s gone, but not its curse.
Magisters, of course! Who else?
Oh my word. How you do astound me.
*Examine the shrine.*
Weight
Now, come towards me. I&apos;ll teleport you down; I just need to see you clearly.
*She slides one of the drinks toward you, her head bobbling heavily on her neck as she nods at the sparkling ale.*
Honey. I know what you are, and I know what I can give you. This isn&apos;t about a little rough and tumble. It&apos;s about that longing in you. The one that nags.
A potion that makes you feel instantly heavier, as if made of stone.
[BEAST] *Grin and tell him no-one&apos;s called you anything but &apos;Beast&apos; in years.
Plenty of new recipes and unique items to craft!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
Pumpkin Soup
Return to Tarquin.
Get that beast out of here!
*Ask if she&apos;s worried people will think she&apos;s a Sourcerer like you.*
So make no mistake, my champion: chances are the road to divinity will be paved with dead gods, their blood on your murderous hands.
*Stay silent; Lohse can handle this.*
*Keep a careful straight face. Ask what else is going on in the world.*
It would have solved all of our problems.
NEW SAVE
Clay Embrace
*Admonish her - how can she expect people to trust her if she hides this from them?*
Oh come now, surely you&apos;ve heard of my writing, or my work with the Historical Guild of Arx...no...?
I- what&apos;s that? What&apos;s happening?
This Black Ring rot has infected the very soil we tread and the air we breathe. I must not let it reach the kingdom...
Johnny! That&apos;s actually true, and you know it.
&lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Talents&lt;/font&gt; determine a character&apos;s unique &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;features&lt;/font&gt;. &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/font&gt; Talents to complement a character&apos;s &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Abilities&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Attributes&lt;/font&gt;.
Grebb gave one of us a Void-tainted fish called Crimson Bream to consume. It made us horribly ill, but Grebb told us that we can combine the species with Ferocity herbmixes in order to increase their potency.
I know you come. I know you do. I know I only have to wait.
It was Sadha who set events in motion, Red Prince. If you were the ripple, she was the wave.
Cave - Drawbridge (Down)
I&apos;d like a word with the guy.
Our gargantuan friend has something of a one-track mind, hmm, Quercus? Why are all giants so focused on taking all they can?
And a well deserved rest it will be!
Excellent! My master has found your kind to be an eternally pragmatic group.
Right, right. Sorry. Just hard not to see yeh as that wild-eyed troublemaker you used to be. It&apos;s been... what? Over a decade, yeah?
Wrongly wrongly wrongly wrong! Your eye decides! Your eye! Now lookie lookie lookie here. If you have three eyes and take away one, how many eyes are there? Last chance! How many eyes?
For the spirit of Eleanessa&apos;s Ancestor Tree to be free, Doctor Daeva must die.
Funny boy. Stick around a while; that&apos;ll change.
The parchment, stiff and expensive by touch, has a distinctly sour, eggy smell.
I am the Meistr&apos;s apprentice. I study under her, but I do not learn. I hear tales of the ritual, of what lies beyond. Such wonders. Such powers. I decide to pursue them myself.
Wouldn&apos;t you like to know!
*Ask for news of Fort Joy.*
*Slowly back away.*
Spiky Flower
Magnificent Amulet
*The seventh tumbler succumbs to your quivering touch. Yet still... nothing. What genius could craft a lock so capricious?*
Character is chilled.
We told Isla Gall about her husband&apos;s plot. Furious, she ran to tell her father.
*Insist he stand down. You killed Isbeil; you will not hesitate to kill him too.*
That was the right answer.
*Shake your head. You sense nothing.*
Tea Herbs
*Say he could be remembered as a hero, if only he revealed the groom&apos;s hiding place.*
Protect Lord Arhu.
What happens now they&apos;re dead? Do I still get paid? Should I even stay here...?
*Say that you came to an agreement with the Advocate. You won&apos;t be killing him.*
Duna knows this ain&apos;t what I signed up for.
*Ask the kid what he&apos;s up to.*
Through Amadia I saw my sins, and I could bear it no longer. I threw myself from the cliff at the entrance. I tried to rid the world of my evil. But Braccus would not allow it...
*The reaver&apos;s spirit wheezes and coughs - a splurt of ectoplasmic matter emerges from his mouth.*
Cooking Pot
*His cheeks tremble, and his eyes move to the skies.*
The biggest news of the Dwarven Queendom is usually the location of the Queen. And guess what? Queen Justinia is here in Arx! She&apos;s staying right here in Lord Kemm&apos;s mansion.
*Allow your mind to touch on hers.*
Toyseller Sanders gave us a Source amulet and the Scroll of Atonement. With them we may bypass the Path of Blood and access Lucian&apos;s tomb.
Hail, darling. Call me Dorotya.
Indeed. Yet more than that. His name is Jonathan. He is my friend. Or... &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; my friend.
*Ask her to tell you something you &lt;i&gt;don&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;know.*
A ha - proof! Pay for your crime, thief!
*Remind her you saved her from certain death back on that ship. Just saying...*
Human Leg
A killer, a thief and a traitor, you are despised and feared by many.
You can&apos;t silence me! GUARDS! GUARDS COME QUICKLY! There&apos;s a Sourcerer in my cell! He&apos;s unlocked the door! GUARDS! Why isn&apos;t anyone coming... I&apos;m being good! I&apos;m being GOOD!
*If he knows this place so well, what does he think you should do?*
Sir, at the service of the realm! Sir!
*She smiles... warily.*
We could use someone ferocious at the elven temple to the north.
*The construction is delightful. Fiendish, even. You wonder if this vision shall prove useful, somewhere along the line.*
Blessings be that you are here. Blessing be that they did not get you too.
Alright, I won&apos;t press this further. Just don&apos;t make me regret this, alright?
Bah! You self-delusional fool. Even to be forced into subjection is to give into it.
(reflected)
City Militiaman
[FANE] *Smile sadly. It&apos;s good to see an Eternal look like a normal person again.*
[BEAST] *Slam your fist down on the crown of his head to get him to shut up.*
Mmmm, home sweet home...
*A long and glorious litany of gruesome murder plays out before you. But all of it is underlaid with a yawning chasm in your heart - a deep and desperate yearning to be loved.*
*To your surprise, he loosens his grip and actually lets you go.*
As for the slave thing, let&apos;s forget about all that shall we? One good turn deserves another, so you may as well have your freedom.
*You are Zusan once more. Alexandar dies. Worse, your human comrades look at you askance, as if his murder was your fault. Even Borris turns against you - when he&apos;s posted to Fort Joy, he does not say goodbye.*
