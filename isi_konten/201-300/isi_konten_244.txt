*Silence greets your answer. In the distance, you hear the screech of an eagle. Worryingly closer, you hear some kind of a &lt;i&gt;moan&lt;/i&gt;. Time passes. At last, the lips on the door creak open and the door speaks.*
*Offer him a healing potion.*
Debugger
*As you approach you feel it hum with a benign power. It seems to pull you in.*
Oh, but it&apos;s so good to meet a friend of Kniles&apos;. Here: Have a little something to eat. Kniles&apos; favourite, you know!
You are the one? We come because of you. I thank you. But the Lone Wolves take her before we are there.
*You struggle to focus on the so-called healer looking down at you... nothing but a human &lt;i&gt;quack&lt;/i&gt;... the end is near, you can sense it...*
You helped retrieve my precious cargo, isn&apos;t that right? How can I help you, my friend?
My, my, a ship fit for a prince! I&apos;ll leave you here and check if young Alexandar kept a decent stock of wine.
Hunter&apos;s Charm
*He shivers and nods his head in the direction of the bridge, but offers no other instructions.*
*She drops the now-empty soul jar to the ground, smashing it to pieces with her foot.*
*Remind her that she&apos;d set out to help her people - not herself.*
You have my thanks, milady.
Put the amulet on and charge it up by consuming Source. Once it&apos;s got five charges in it, it&apos;ll be ready to go.
This time, freshie. &lt;i&gt;Only &lt;/i&gt;this time.
Are ye her man, or sail ye with us?
Greetings!
*Off the dragon soars, ready to heed your call.*
Step away from my child. I warn you!
Tension: Medium&lt;br&gt;You shouldn&apos;t do anything out of the ordinary.
Or shrieking monsters tied to posts...
&lt;i&gt;&apos;Beat us, break us, green-black sea - we are slaves only to thee.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
*Within you, Amadia stirs. She says little, but her desire rises from your heart as if it were your own: &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;must make it to the mountain. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;must reach the well. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;must make the necessary sacrifices...*
Blood Forest Foggy
*Square your shoulders and fix him with a look that says your patience is wearing thin.*
Boar Form
[UNDEAD] *Shake your head. You&apos;re never thirsty.*
Codlefish
Please. It was a mercy to put those dolts out of their misery.
Wreckers&apos; Cave - Depths
Exter is reluctant to attack the Magisters without the means to defeat the Shriekers that guard the approaches to the harbour. We should investigate on how to defeat such creatures.
Huh. What&apos;s this? There&apos;s a note here...
*Ask what she was doing here for this boss Lohar.*
*Side with the brother. The rebellion was a terrible mistake.*
*Before you can remove it, it vanishes. You stand before the figure, unmasked.*
*He rolls his eyes, and turns back to the flames.*
Not your heart that&apos;s supposed to be in it, prince.
Magic statues, a meeting from on high... whatever&apos;s happening, I must say, I quite like it.
Poor fella. Can&apos;t imagine such a thing, myself. Family&apos;s not supposed to do that.
Natalie&apos;s Despair
Report Higba&apos;s death to the Magisters.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him you&apos;ve precious few friends and he&apos;s not one of them.*
Even a god&apos;s got to get laid, chief. I... think, anyway.
Brave lad, waltzing in here now.
A black cat! Hello, kitty.
*...but not this traitor. This Scion has betrayed the elves. This Scion has taken a darker path. This Scion wants your Source for someone... or some&lt;i&gt;thing...&lt;/i&gt; else.*
*Ask where she&apos;ll go now.*
What just happened? You mean my display of proper posture and etiquette? The benefits of charm school. I don&apos;t expect you&apos;d qualify.
We weren&apos;t able to help the Magister. He attacked us.
*Yes, here she stands. Your deepest secret. Your deepest desire. She whom you&apos;ve longed for since your soul slipped into consciousness. And you lock eyes with her.*
*Tell him you have other obligations and take your leave.*
We seek to master the secrets of the universe.
[JESTER] *Ask if she&apos;d like to hear a joke.*
Air Skill Scroll
Smoke Trap
*The leader gives you a curious look, then turns away.*
*You hear - not with your ears, but deep within you - a whisper: &apos;Saheila&apos;.*
It is not a difficult battle - it is an impossible one. Gareth will lead them to their deaths.
Bloody ring - it&apos;s loose!
Decorational Sword
Strong is bark; weak is flesh. Even this dying heart will shred you!
The ancestor tree. The screams came to me on the wind - though I am not sure the devil&apos;s breath that perturbs the air here can rightly be called &apos;wind&apos;. But they&apos;ve been silenced...
The path might be clear, but we can&apos;t leave without Sir Gareth.
Look away from the past and into the future, Sebille. There is so much work left to do.
*The lizard holds a crimson-soaked rag against his side. He looks up as you approach, his expression oddly serene...*
That right, Del? Isn&apos;t right to save the entire realm from Divine-damned chaos?
Dead Black Ring Mage
Distinctive Wizard&apos;s Hat Agaric
An extra layer of protection for the Princess. The arena was fashioned after one in my homeland, but the opponents you faced were provided by your unconscious mind.&lt;br&gt;
Billy
Pull the lever.
Take care. Be tough. These are easy. To keep an open heart in a place like this is hard. But an open heart knows the difference between right and wrong.
...but in a pinch, marrow will do, too.
Fish Storage Key
You must be mad. I cut you down to size!
Physical Armour
Hell, if they can finish &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; off, I&apos;d pay for their golden coffin myself.
How interesting... I haven&apos;t heard that before thus far. Duly noted!
*Your fingers burn with cold as you pull them away, and you can feel a darkness twisting in your gut.*
Come, sit down with me for a moment.
Make... it... stop...
*A dwarf you&apos;ve never met stands within this otherworldly plane - and a voice you&apos;ve never heard echoes in your mind. &apos;Marcus Miles&apos;, it intones, and you grasp your own head in familiar terror.*
Get rid of the demon.
*Carved from unfamiliar metal in an alien style, this mysterious object yet glows with a pulsating inner light that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; familiar to you: the unmistakeable brilliance of Source.*
*Say you haven&apos;t seen any signs of her, and perhaps Fara should start expecting the worst...*
A clean kill... from the wrong killer. Alexandar should have had the courage to execute her.
*It&apos;s daunting, it&apos;s too much, &lt;i&gt;it&apos;s far too much&lt;/i&gt;, it&apos;s...*
Know? No. Heard of? &lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you&apos;ll see about that, then turn away.*
No weak links are allowed within the chain...
*You awaken, still strapped down. You groggily turn your head to see the Doctor place another piece of you into a jar of fluid. How much more can you lose and still live...?*
&lt;i&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...!&lt;/i&gt;
Of course she&apos;ll be so kind. Speak freely, kinsman!
History would damn us, if anyone were left to write it.
*He pauses a moment to wipe a thick mixture of sweat and blood from his brow before continuing.*
*Your whole body flushes. You&apos;re sure you must be glowing, so deep does the warmth dwell.*
I thought we were dead. I was so sure.
[1] has been slain!
*Nod and take your leave.*
You&apos;re trapped, Seeker! Stand down; no-one else needs to die!
*Tell him where to stick his oath.*
*For the briefest of moments, the wooden scales upon the dragon figurehead undulate, almost like it was &lt;i&gt;bristling with anger.*&lt;/i&gt;
Reptiles
CRITICAL
[SCHOLAR] *You&apos;ve seen this symbol in forbidden texts of the Ancient Empire.*
Explode, creating fire surfaces and dealing [1] in a large area around you (except areas blocked by obstacles).
Sleep is for the weak! WEAK! You just wait indeed, you&apos;ll fall into it like all the others... not &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; NEVER &lt;i&gt;ME!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you certainly understand the gravity of the situation - all the more reason to help her get that demon gone, fast.*
Doctor Daeva:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know who - what - you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not want &apos;treatment&apos; and I do not need to be cured. But there is another I would like to see... shall we say, &apos;healed&apos;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am willing to pay your going fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;G.V.
*The dwarf smiles, at ease despite his imprisonment.*
vignette
*She shakes her head, eyes squeezed shut.*
*Nod your head respectfully, but do not eat the flesh.*
*Ignore him. You&apos;ve seen enough conflict for one day.*
*You pull away with a jerk, gasping for breath. The dwarf whimpers a little in front of you.*
Harbinger&apos;s Step
*Insist that there&apos;s no time to spare.*
I&apos;m a man of taste, as you no doubt see. A relic this significant would make an incredible addition to my collection. Don&apos;t deny an old elf his... simple pleasures.
*Squeeze a tear from the corner of your eye. How could someone accuse you of such a thing?*
We were caught with our pants down, to use a dwarven expression. This mustn&apos;t happen again!
So you&apos;re telling me you weren&apos;t malicious - you were just too &lt;i&gt;weak &lt;/i&gt;to know you were bein&apos; played? What a gods-damned &lt;i&gt;joke,&lt;/i&gt; Justinia.
Backslash
&apos;Fast&apos; most certainly being the operative word.
*Tell her she needn&apos;t ask you: The floor is hers.*
*Say you spoke to Anhar&apos;s spirit. He seemed concerned about getting soulforged weapons out of a cave...*
Look who we have here! You were on the ship as well, weren&apos;t you? The one that sank? I wouldn&apos;t have bet tuppence on your survival, yet here you are.
*You feel him in your head, scrabbling for purchase amongst your thoughts, looking for a way in, his madness and his anger and his hate banging on the door of your mind...*
You really don&apos;t want to know. If you&apos;ve got business here, go to the main entrance around the corner. Otherwise, do us both a service and clear off.
*The cook shakes her head with a sigh.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source, just as she took the life of the young Magister.*
Or perhaps, and this is just a thought, we could find my mask and escape this wretched island?
*This is a book of songs and sonatas written by the great bard Kirill, the greatest composer known to both living and undead. One song in particular catches your eye.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The springs mix with the rivers, and the rivers with the sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the waters may duly merge, then why not you with me?
*And suddenly the weeping little boy is back; tugging at your non-existent heart. Were it not for your alarming lack of tear ducts, you&apos;d likely be weeping too.*
The river of my Source has been dammed. My link to the font from which it flows, severed.
*The dwarf glances at Ifan, pulls you close, and whispers.*
Imagine if I&apos;d&apos;ve said the same when Dallis was about to blow you to smithereens on the high seas.
I must admit - I always wanted to give the haughty captain a good thump.
[IFAN] *Quote the late Divine. &apos;You cleanse evil with every righteous blow.&apos;*
It has the shape of Tir-Cendelius, but speaks the tongue of beasts. How cruel.
You&apos;re lucky that I enjoy a bumpy ride, my dear. Our arrival here was... &lt;i&gt;vigorous&lt;/i&gt;, even for my tastes...
Ryker petitioned the newly risen Divine to free him of the Covenant. Would the Divine swing the Swornbreaker Scythe? Ryker was potentially a powerful ally in the continuing war...
*Tell him he&apos;s quite welcome here.*
[These White Magister meeting notes are written with the crazed fervour of the zealot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With much repetition and jargon, they reveal that the White Magisters firmly believe that they are following in Lucian&apos;s own footsteps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only that, they seem to believe that Lucian himself is still somehow leading them - and that they must prevent any outsiders from entering the crypt.]
No signs, no early warnings of... magic; sparkle? Sounds rather dull. Nevertheless, &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; landed you in Fort Joy.
