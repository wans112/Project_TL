*Say that what you were doing here is of no concern to him. He&apos;d do well to forget all about this, unless he&apos;s on the hunt for trouble.*
An unseen force protects the lever.
Earth Shard
Cheese
*Scalding energy compresses your head in an iron grip. You set your jaw tight, refusing to relent.*
*Admit that you do.*
Dear one... no. Your anger... no - I should not say. You must discover for yourself.
*The young woman flushes with anger.*
*Tell her you want to hear the story. You bet it&apos;s really fun.*
I came here and waited. The door swung open and it was... him. A face I hadn&apos;t seen since I was called to the Seekers. He didn&apos;t say a word, just flashed the arrest warrant. Seems he didn&apos;t expect the punch.
I ain&apos;t one o&apos; yer crew, &lt;i&gt;capt&apos;n.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask if you reject your God, can she get him out of you?*
A Magister caravan of captive Sourcerers was attacked by dwarves.
Advisors, councillors, grand viziers... burn &apos;em all and use the ash to wash yer dishes.
Goodness. I thought lizards were sophisticated, but your mind is so &lt;i&gt;feeble.&lt;/i&gt; To think, a simpleton touched with Divinity. The Gods really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;cruel.
*It whines, a keening sound that pierces your ears, but nothing intelligible can be heard within the din.*
There are monsters here. Lizard ones and real ones. It&apos;s really scary. And I miss my Ma and Pa.
Stolen - from Kemm? Such a loss. I had hoped the citizens of Arx might get a chance to lay eyes upon it. Seems that hope has been all but snuffed out.
There&apos;s Deathfog pumping out of every grate in the city. Arx never stood a chance.
You have done me a great service. The time has come to serve you - if I can. Are you ready, Lohse?
*As you draw in deeper and deeper breaths, you feel your tension dissipating. The anger slinks away, like a whipped cur. It will not shape you this day.*
Scrolls of Eternity
Oh, oh Conway. We can go &lt;i&gt;home!&lt;/i&gt;
You know him? Is he - was he - holding up okay?
[JESTER] *Let out a long whistle. Boy, Gareth packs quite a wallop!*
HA!
You&apos;ll have to ask the Meistr about that. She&apos;s dying to meet you.
*The automaton remains dormant. Weak light pulses from its core, and the compartment in its side lies empty.*
I am the Scion of the Mother Tree. Her heart speaks through me.
*Nod. He can trust you.*
Chapel of the Divine
*The spirit crouches - ready to leap up and catch the bouquet...*
[NOBLE] *Tell him the painting style was primitive, but you got the picture.*
Sewn Scale Armour
Release...
All together once more. We should throw a party.
*Say you recognise that troll. It&apos;s Grog, from Reaper&apos;s Coast!*
*Cry out and keep struggling to break free.*
Trader is busy
What you can do is read the tome by the bookcase and get started. Go!
*Take your leave.*
*Her face pales. A moment passes.*
Unripe Hot Kettle
*You won&apos;t take this kind of talk from a frog. Take your leave.*
Oh please. That&apos;s not nearly enough.
*Say that anything she can say to Lohse, she can say to you.*
Oh, but you mustn&apos;t leave just yet. There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one other promise I need to keep...
I&apos;m no canary, but I know b-b-bad news when I see it.
[SOLDIER] *Tell him that battling Voidwoken felt like a good use of time.*
&lt;i&gt;You&apos;ve tended not to the seed the Seven have planted. Without faith, it cannot flourish, and so on your flesh it must feed.&lt;/i&gt;
*Mumble an apology. You crossed a line. You shouldn&apos;t have.*
Beast. Your invitation arrived as scheduled, I see. Most excellent.
Hot enough down here to melt silver...
Captain&apos;s Skullcracker
&apos;Genuine Dwarven Smithing &amp; Ironmongering - open for business!&apos;
*Lie and say that you travel alone.*
*Break the silence with a whoop. The queen is dead - hurrah!*
*Leave the dying man be.*
It has been a while, hasn&apos;t it? It&apos;s good to see you well, old friend.
*You are a Magister, chasing the Sourceress Hannag from Paradise Downs, where her Sourcery drew Voidwoken. The damage was immeasurable. You harden your heart that you may do your job.*
*Beg the Magister&apos;s pardon, you think you were mistaken.*
You may stay forever. Each lock opens only with a soul. And how many of those does one mortal have?
Well, I suppose he might still be alright then... if you do see him, let me know. Please.
*Draw your weapon. You won&apos;t be intimidated.*
[JESTER] *Say that it&apos;s nice to have some food reserves for a cold night.*
Garvan abandoned his goods on the road west.
Poisoned Cup of Water
*Whistles* You are &lt;i&gt;tall!&lt;/i&gt; And red. What&apos;s your name?
Every forest camp needs a little culture. Let me help you! Come trade!
Dead Seeker
No, no, no...
That&apos;s the nicest thing anyone&apos;s ever said to me.
The God King will return those he favours!
*It&apos;s just too tempting. Crack the glass container and take a cutting for yourself.*
Trxyl
Where were the proud elves like you, when the Magisters came to rip me from the earth, and carve me into pieces? You ran - you abandoned your forest and your ancestors.
*You can barely contain your pleasure at having hurt it. Ask it how it felt.*
This is not the end. With him, there is no end.
Icy Skin
*Ifan&apos;s hands reach for your own. His magnetic eyes seek yours. You know this man. He is ruthless, capable of anything. These hands that hold your own have tortured, maimed, &lt;i&gt;killed&lt;/i&gt;...*
Let me speak to whoever&apos;s &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;in charge, or shut up.
That&apos;s it! The barrels and the chests! On the double!
Help survivors escape the lower deck.
My Queen - the Godwoken hobbled the Black Ring by slicing off one of its limbs, a necromancer known as the Sallow Man.
Save As...
Not a healer - a doctor. Think harder. You must have come across one in your travels.
*Kiss her back.*
*Leave the spirit be.*
Always happy to squash a bug if I get the chance. &apos;specially with a toughie like you on the front!
I taste it on the wind.
I can feel its power.
Unseen forces hold me back; only a Godwoken may press on, it seems. But do not underestimate my presence. Source flows freely here. It&apos;s a place of incredible power, where a single prayer holds the weight of thousands. Your heart and soul shall fill as quickly as they are drained.
*The scene below is a confusion of battle. Great powers clash against one another. Spells meet spells, swords meet shields.*
Throw an explosive trap at target location. Trap takes 1 turn to activate. When active, the trap will explode when a character approaches it.
To the Nameless Isle
Gratiana will not be pleased...
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry, but you must deny her.*
Sharp Sword
New talents! Have you ever wanted to resurrect your allies as zombies? Do you hate missing the one attack that really matters? This modification contains remedies to those problems and many more!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
*Assure him that he&apos;s exactly where he&apos;s meant to be.*
You would waste my gift? I will rip you asunder, then strip my armour from your undeserving corpse.
Source Chained
Arhu was one of the few that was either great or good. He was- &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;the Grandmaster of this Order. Never mind an old friend.
*An undead reaver lifts a clay goblet of wine and drinks deep... only the wine trickles out through a hole in his side a moment later. He glances at you with a shrug.*
You&apos;ve shown me kindness in the face of my sins. My worship is the least I can offer.
Rules don&apos;t apply to Griff. Or haven&apos;t you figured that out yet?
What in the world...?!
I miss being a wizard, though. Not sure I&apos;d be on top of all the latest techniques, but I&apos;d make a fine teacher of the old school, I would!
Blue Mushroom
From observing her, I gathered that the ritual involves inhaling the smoke, a lot of screaming, and a rather sudden death.
*Scoff and say she still defines herself by her Master: a slave&apos;s mentality.*
Pouch? What pouch.
Spirit of Lyn Pryce
Sight Range Indicator
Nature&apos;s Crossbow
Gawin
[UNDEAD] *Assure the dog you&apos;re not mean. Generally.*
You have just re-assigned a character who was recruited by an avatar. Keep in mind that the story arc for the character can only progress if it is assigned to the original recruiter once more.&lt;br&gt;Lending characters out is not a problem, just make sure they return to their original avatar to continue their story arc.
*The ghostly tiger bares her teeth at you, a triumphant glint in her eye.*
&lt;b&gt;Who knows, we might even find that mythical weapon of yours...&lt;/b&gt;
*Cough!* *Ahem!*
No trespassers in the court of her Royal Highness, the Princess!
*Rotate the statue.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you&apos;ve seen it before. Getting posted in a backwater like this makes soldiers&apos; feet itch.*
Please, my king, raise me again! The shriekers are so close - I didn&apos;t have time to flee! I&apos;ll be swifter next time, &lt;i&gt;I promise!&lt;/i&gt;
It is a lake: a pool of pure Source, containing half the powers of each of the Gods.
Initialising network...
Don&apos;t worry. I don&apos;t hold it against you. Besides, you weren&apos;t wrong.
We know what you have to do. Nothing in that terrible place would have swayed fate one way or another.
Character is bonded to Adramahlihk. As long as this character lives, Adramahlihk cannot die.
until the day I am freed -
Very well then, your eminent holiness.
I ordered it to be destroyed. I guess Mordus - whoever he&apos;s working for - wants it for themselves.
*Ask what will happen to all these souls. There are so many of them, each with their own stories, their own lives.*
Zaan-dey,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel evilâ€™s eye upon us. Every night my dreams are the same: the imperial consulate burns, and lizard corpses among the flames. If the consulate falls, you must be ready. Moor a boat at the rocky beach under the western cliff. Take every sacred artefact you can carry with you to the water - yes, even that heresy of the Devourer. We cannot let armour with such power fall into the wrong hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours in faith, Dreamer Taiara
What could you possibly do that&apos;s worse than that?
Devourer&apos;s Hunger
Good enough.
*Smile and thank him. You&apos;re looking forward to resting for a little while.*
*The spirit of a young woman glances around in confusion.*
*Gratiana&apos;s soul flits through the air, eyes wild and desperate. She turns to you as her spirit starts to fade from this world.*
*Ask if she means those horrific creatures that Magister had in tow.*
*Promise her that her destiny is fulfilled. Dragons will soar again!*
Adrenaline
*Tell him you&apos;re a Lone Wolf.*
*In spite of what happened the last time, reach out and touch the figurehead again.*
*Say &apos;Ygerna&apos;.*
History isn&apos;t just the past - it&apos;s knowing that there&apos;ll be a future which you can contribute to.
Beggar&apos;s Dog
THOU ART A... &lt;i&gt;MURDERER.&lt;/i&gt;
Dog Die
But it is you! *Ahem* All rugged and ragged. How the mighty have fallen, hmmm?
*The spirit turns in confusion, his sword at the ready - too late.*
Take a moment. Listen. Let the wind tell you its secrets.
That&apos;s the plan, Master mine.
[BEAST] *Tell him the truth: All you want is for good people to be safe, and bad people to get what&apos;s coming to them.*
But I do. For I&apos;ve no intention of losing myself once more.
Now is not the time. My demons haunt me too closely.
