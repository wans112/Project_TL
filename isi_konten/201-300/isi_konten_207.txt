Blood Contagion
*The spirit remains silent, even as you drain every drop of his lifeblood. His legacy of verse is reduced to a final, shivering form.*
*Yes, you most certainly would.*
This blood-flecked chest key is grimy beyond belief. It clearly suffers extremely frequent use at the hands of someone with violent tendencies.
[SEBILLE] *Implore the girl to fight on. She can only be enslaved if she lets it happen.*
It&apos;s dark, but I can hear the water below.
The God of the Orcs - Vrogir.
*Lie. Tell him you know nothing of his family&apos;s fate.*
We told Hannag that her apprentice Gwydian was alive and well; she was pleased to hear it.
Poor Alexandar. What else? Slaughtered like a supper lamb. Poor dear.
I&apos;ve told you before, and I won&apos;t tell you again: that doesn&apos;t belong to you!
Cryogenic Stasis Scroll
I&apos;d like to hear his reasons from the horse&apos;s mouth. People will say what they like about you; doesn&apos;t make it true.
[JESTER] *Juggle the jar back and forth between your hands...*
Poisoned Staff
Noble sir, my master awaits. To the west. I will not harm you...
Fire Essence
*Ask if there&apos;s any help or advice he could offer to you for what is to come.*
I fight. I do not win and I do not die. It is this way from the moment we left our homeland. From the moment the mists of death descend.
I hope Lucian appears this year. My husband is very sick - I don&apos;t know if he&apos;ll live to see next year&apos;s festival.
An empty cave with a bare altar. Strange.
Few survived.
Now, he&apos;s chosen... &lt;i&gt;another. &lt;/i&gt;I should &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; you for what you&apos;ve done to me. Hate you for the hell I&apos;ve lived.
Things do not end well for Alexandar. Trust me.
*Challenge the Magister. Who&apos;s she to ask you questions?*
*Say that you came here to confront a thief... you hadn&apos;t expected to find a murderer.*
Suite Key
I&apos;m glad you came when you did. Even if it weren&apos;t in time for poor Hammond here, Divine rest him.
It doesn&apos;t make sense. I&apos;m missing something.
[FANE] *Bow slightly and tell him your name is Fane.*
You&apos;ll do as you&apos;re told or I&apos;ll knock some teeth out of that highborn mouth - now get over here!
Stand down, Magister! STAND DOWN!
Changing [1] settings failed
And here and there, across the world, what was left of the Black Ring fought on.
*The ring sits heavily in her hand. Her fingertips droop under its weight, and it seems about to fall to the ground when she grasps it tightly and holds it to her breast.*
*Stay silent. Isbeil might have more plaudits for you.*
[BEAST] *Say no-one has called you anything but &apos;Beast&apos; in some time. He&apos;s welcome to do the same.*
What? Source? I-...
Honestly, I&apos;ve no idea -
Charred
Fort Joy Beach
*Say you were told he could assist you with an &lt;i&gt;errand.*&lt;/i&gt;
This ring... it bears the Magister seal. And there&apos;s blood on it!
He might have had good reasons to associate with the tyrant. We don&apos;t know his life - he should be given peace.
Dusty and crusty lab equipment that has been used recently. For what, you&apos;d rather not think about.
*The spirit glances down at her own ringless hand and utters a sigh.*
Now, do you accept this felicity or reject my master&apos;s grace?
Hrrm... alright. Pass freely, and don&apos;t interfere with the conjurer.
*Tell him the lizard champion is dead.*
If you hadn&apos;t come along, I would&apos;ve been eaten by them damn hatchlings we were guarding.
*Say you met that awful witch Radeka. Watching her die was your pleasure.*
*Focus on the spirit&apos;s eyes. The glimmer within them may reveal her purpose in this tomb.*
[BEAST] *Smirk, and tell him that history&apos;s just a series of lies we tell ourselves to justify our present sins.*
*Yank the lever downwards.*
A spell that destroys a character&apos;s body once and for all, preventing resurrection.
*Hold up your hand. You can&apos;t risk him. You&apos;ll deal with this.*
Crushed Elven Corpse
*Ah, the Yuthul Gor split. It&apos;s one of your more inventive tricks...*
Oh, yes. Do allow me to explain:
So you have found me. She who I plucked from the water as she sank and drowned, who I tossed unto the shore with seaweed in her hair, salt and sand upon her skin.
*He glances around the deck, gaze flitting from Sourcerer to Magister to Sourcerer.*
*The spirit of the Magister is now frantically attempting to pinch herself.*
The Shadow Prince thanked us for our service, and left us a reward.
Good day to you.
&lt;i&gt;Oh righteous Seven... reward the dead, and safeguard the living...&lt;/i&gt;
Why pause? I&apos;ve lost things dearer to me than him last time I trimmed my nails.
*Glance at the nearby bodies and ask what they did to deserve this.*
Despatcher
Two kids on the dock in Driftwood stood waiting for their friend. He had gone swimming and was yet to return.
We disabled the Source barrier.
Ah, freedom! Tastes better than wine.
*Confirm your position. You won&apos;t tell her again.*
&lt;i&gt;WHAT?&lt;/i&gt;
Here. Let&apos;s toast. To us.

My doors only open on the occasion of truth. What you admit to them, you admit to me, human.
*Hit him for an outrageously unreasonable sum.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82])

*Excuse yourself and take your leave.*
Lovely Sandals
We killed the Black Ring. The &apos;Advocate&apos; appeared. Grateful for our aid, he let us live.
*The skeleton passes you an amulet, dangling from a glittering gold chain.*
*Nod in agreement. It sounds to you like his crewmates are the real heroes.*
Don&apos;t be a spoilsport. &lt;i&gt;We &lt;/i&gt;are rising, Lohse. Don&apos;t you feel it? The great power that grows within us? Soon we will be strong enough to ascend to the highest heights imaginable.
Keep distant. My own demons haunt me too closely. I cannot also bear the burden of yours.
Contentious cur. Thou would&apos;st dare prance and gallivant about without a summons? Get thee gone, for at the count of a dozen less two, the sentries advance!
I do not expect to hear his voice. But I meditate, I look upon his disciples, I take in his resting place. Perhaps the answers come. Peace, too.
...Arx! Micheil Ros. Micheil and Isla must run! Tell Micheil Ros to take his daughter and run!
Amadia! What- what &lt;i&gt;happened &lt;/i&gt;to you? Did you truly fall so far?
We don&apos;t speak of &lt;i&gt;His Holiness &lt;/i&gt;that way in this establishment!
Get out of here, Prince. I can&apos;t be seen with you. I&apos;m... sorry.
Surgeon
The Hammer got you curious? Funny name for a gal like that. When I knew her, the Feather would&apos;ve been a likelier name.
We&apos;re better off without vile necromancers like that.
*You kiss. It&apos;s sweet and wonderful. You wish it could last forever.*
*The cook smiles. Her eyes bore right into you. Her hand remains concealed behind her.*
I smell a rat. Two of them actually. And I&apos;ve not much patience for pests...
*The old warrior steeples his hands and stares at you as you speak. When you&apos;re done he sits back, silent for a moment.*
Quercus - that squirrel. Is- was it a Knight of Drey?
[This manuscript about the imp goddess Xantezza is - or was - clearly in progress.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xantezza, the Goddess of mirth and laughter, wanted an intelligent race, and clove to the imps, creating the most talented magicians and engineers.
[SCHOLAR] *Scowl and declare that you are a learned scholar of some note - it would be the height of foolishness for him to reject your help.*
BEGIN.
To help the Godwoken. And why-
Attack the demon.
Winds like these... she would&apos;a capsized before she reached the break. Well! On to plan B.
Gwydian called her the Elementalist, though I don&apos;t rightly know what that means.
The Archers of the Northern Peaks need no introductions. Any lost hunters or curious wanderers who happen upon them are made aware of this fact by a swift arrow through the heart.  Self-sufficient nomads, the Archers have no concern for the affairs of flatlanders and are loathe to descend from the icy mountains they call home. Only once in all history did the tribe deign to join the affairs of the mainland: to fight the ever-encroaching war against the Source King Braccus.  Since Braccus&apos; defeat, the Archers have, once per generation, offered their finest soldier to the Order of the Source Hunters in an effort to rout Source before it ever may rise again. These soldiers are unmatchable in Rivellon for their marksmanship and ability to strike, unseen, like a frigid wind.
Ah, his specialty. In light of that, I&apos;ll keep it brief.
*The long, sharp needle is blackened with the ink that fuels its purpose: to tattoo the names of those you hunt upon your skin.*
We defeated the constructs. Who sent them? And why?
He&apos;s as cuuute as a kitten, isn&apos;t he?
Alexandar and Dallis executed a treasonous Magister. Other rebels in the Order may help us escape.
*Tell him this Sallie deserves a better man than he.*
*Say you&apos;d have thought she&apos;s a Master of the Source herself.*
It&apos;s so cold. I haven&apos;t felt cold in centuries!
Guilty as sin, are you? Then you will pay!
*He shoots you a patronising smile, the most infuriating smile you&apos;ve ever seen in all your years on this earth.*
*Sigh* Who would&apos;ve thought we&apos;d make it this far. I guess we make an okay team after all.
Consult Malady.
*Correct her. You actually &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;working on Griff&apos;s behalf.*
*Get indignant. How dare you be accused of such a thing!*
[SCHOLAR] *Muse that by the room&apos;s shape, you can tell you&apos;re on a Lucian-class frigate. But why?*
*Say that you would like to recruit Seekers to join you.*
Can you feel it?
&lt;i&gt;So when the Deathfog fell and all other Ancestors fell silent - I called out. And now I am broken-made-whole.&lt;/i&gt;
Better one soul damned than two.
*Sigh* If I were looking for a Master of Mirth, you would be ideal. Alas, there are no Masters of Source here.
Patty Cake, Patty Cake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basic ingredient of the most common food is dough. All you need is flour and water, and you can just about make anything from then on. Apple pie, fish pie, pizza, cheese buns?
*But first you have to steal the keys. Your tutors have one each, but you can&apos;t risk getting caught - you&apos;d earn yourself a trip to the Chancellor&apos;s chamber. One from which you suspect you would not return.*
The witch Alice Alisceon is dead.
Hail!
Lizard Sabre
Official Dwarven Merchant&apos;s Last Will &amp; Testament
You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;funny&lt;/i&gt;.
Like me, I guess. Only bigger. You seen her, mister?
That I did. In Lucian&apos;s own army.
You&apos;ll have rest now, y&apos;old bull.
There&apos;s a so-and-so going around talking to people, then teleporting away mid-conversation! Watch out - I think they&apos;re up to something.
BOCK!
We&apos;ve found the Devourer&apos;s chestplate. When we touched it, a sorrowful memory encouraged us to visit the lizard enclave in Arx.
*The elf&apos;s deep, golden eyes go wide. A strange smile dances across his mouth and he starts to roar with laughter.*
No, my child, it is perhaps worse. They have been corrupted by their own vanity. By the pettiness of the mortals they crafted.
Scarred and sturdy, this trusty workbench bears the scratched names of many apprentices upon it.
