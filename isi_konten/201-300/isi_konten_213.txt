Saheila offered to help us improve our mastery of Source by connecting us with the roots of the Ancestor Trees that lie all across the world, deep beneath its surface. We shunned her offer however, and lost a chance to deepen our powers.

See what I&apos;m dealin&apos; wiv&apos;? C&apos;mon, settle the argument. Tell &apos;im &apos;e&apos;s wrong.
Are you sure you want to delete [1]?
[BARBARIAN] *Move in for the kill. You&apos;ve had enough talking for one day.*
Stay out of their way.
Heartseeker
Malady&apos;s twin-tipped spear brims with magical energy. Just like its owner, it is ever cool to the touch, and quite deadly.
This place sets my teeth on edge.
Nameless Player
*Say you&apos;re sorry, she&apos;s right. She should go speak to him.*
*Saheila pats your right arm with a warm, motherly smile, but then...*
[MYSTIC] *Focus on the magic to determine its essence.*
The proud man has returned, but yours is the pride, is it not? All in this sanctuary rejoice to have Sir Gareth back, but yours is the glory.
I&apos;ve caught you red-handed, and now I&apos;m going to make you &lt;i&gt;pay.&lt;/i&gt;
*Intolerable! Ask what it is you&apos;ve done to deserve such hostility.*
See? Told ya! Take that, Sourcerer! Come on, Dallis, help me put a collar on &apos;er!
*Snap that you haven&apos;t fallen - you were pushed. It&apos;s all the King&apos;s fault.*
It&apos;s no easy life for a bull out there. All most see is a walkin&apos; steak, &apos;less I&apos;m hitched t&apos;a wagon.
*Ask her to tell you about this &apos;Covenant&apos; once more.*
&lt;br&gt;From Wits: [1]
*Beast grimaces and looks in every other direction but yours.*
Hey, I heard about you. Had a go in the Arena, didn&apos;t you? So? How&apos;d it go?
*As you approach Alexandar, Ifan catches you by the shoulder.*
Before you go, Lohse: Perhaps you sense it already, but this is where he lives. Your demon. You must be exceedingly careful; he&apos;ll be waiting for you.
HOLD IT! Not a step farther, understand?
*Let it go.*
&lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;. You don&apos;t look like you have it in you, tall Tessie...
Forget it...
Worn and torn and poorly darned, this shirt has seen better days.
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present your bastard cousin and the Seed of Divinity: Marcus Miles.
*Agree to the destroy the jar.*
Micheil Ros
*You&apos;re ready for this. Step into your destiny.*
There&apos;s Paladins up ahead, men of my vintage... wonder if I served with any of them back in the war?
We informed Jahan of the Advocate&apos;s demise.
My thanks, friend. I can&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve seen her smile like that. If there&apos;s ever anything we can do for you, you have only to ask.
While we fought the Magisters on the shore, the Seekers seized the Lady Vengeance. Escape from the island was ours.
Suit yourself. You&apos;d prefer something else?
Do you hear the beauty of the dragon&apos;s song? This is the majesty my Empress held in her heart.

*The putrid pile of muscle and malevolence gnaws happily on her food.*
Use SMAA for the best visual experience at the cost of performance. Use FXAA for a good visual experience and win some performance. Disable for the best performance.
You&apos;re making this much harder than it needs to be.
Think those fingers of yours will ever heal?
*Ask if it feels... pain.*
A reward...? You&apos;ll get nothing unless you can prove these claims!
*Ask him to take a step back.*
One day he vanished, and was never seen in Rivellon again.
*Tell him you don&apos;t like the sea. Bad things happen at sea.*
My fate was written from the beginning. I was never going to manage it. When someone that powerful wants something from you, they just take it. That&apos;s what they do. Only an idiot pretends they won&apos;t.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Beast - the prey that my master seeks... Godwoken...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Out the rear door there, then look over the edge by the waterside. There&apos;s a little patch of land, next to where the sewers drain into the water.
You have succeeded where I could not.
*You walk towards the figure on the dais, but wisps of mist start to cloud your vision. With each step, the mist gets thicker, hiding the figure from sight.*
Tremor Grenade
So many tales, so many memories, buried in the soil.
*The squirrel tenses for half a moment before relaxing into your fingers*
Not bad, not bad! I can&apos;t wait to hear more.
*Decline and turn to take your leave.*
Exit
*Nod, then take your leave.*
*You retch up the last of the ale into a foul-smelling puddle behind the tavern. You straighten, letting the cool night air sober you up...*
*Tell him to go right ahead.*
Your prey lies on a far-off shore, at the heart of the Nameless Isle. It is a place no-one can reach unless their soul becomes their compass.
*Squints...* Oh hey, you&apos;re right. You look just like a lizard what had a run-in with boss last week. But now that I think of it, he was got rid of later that same day. Never mind.
*Address the Sourcerer and ask her what she meant by &apos;There are others whose lives must end&apos;.*
Um... well marm, we were hoping you&apos;d see fit to re-open the school.
Haven&apos;t you heard...?
But I&apos;ll let you figure that out for yourself. After all, children must feel lost in the woods before they truly appreciate the security of home.
Insert
You do? Then... Then I think you&apos;re right. I&apos;ll not do it.
*Sniffs* I&apos;m trying.
*Her mouth meets yours, and devours you with predatory abandon. Somewhere in the recesses of your mind, you think you hear her voice sigh &lt;i&gt;&apos;mine&apos;...&lt;/i&gt; but then the kiss ends.*
Conjures a trusty personal demon and elemental totems to aid in battle
*Tell him his brother and his father likely wait in the Hall of Echoes.*
Oh, sh-sh-she was a &lt;i&gt;fine &lt;/i&gt;one! You see there, she writes like a cottage innocent, but the truth is, it was &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; who stole everything from the Kemms.
*You know all you needed to know. You will find Sadha and rescue her. As for him, he dies today!*
Glrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
I know you&apos;re perfectly aware of what I am, but those masks can be darned pesky.
Sir Gareth is looking for a way to defeat them now. Let us hope he finds it.
The archives...? Parchment. Books. Writings about evil things. And the hymn book that guards them. None of it helped us in the end.
You still need to face him. You still need to best him. But you can do it. Of that I have no doubt - &lt;i&gt;none.&lt;/i&gt;
Brahmos
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without the bounty on Mummie Dearest&apos;s head.
Who put the contract out on the Godwoken? My old pack will know. They may even know why.
*Wonder who exactly would hire the Lone Wolves to go after Godwoken.*
*Tell her that it will take a while for you to trust her unconditionally.*
Hah! Removed your collar like a disobedient dog, I see! I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
*Stay quiet.*
The moment we discovered the Void, we understood the Veil was created to hold it at bay by powers even more ancient than us. But thanks to the King, that evil has been seeping through the cracks.
The bastards burn well, I&apos;ll say that for &apos;em.
Yes?
Is that a promise, darling?
*Say you were born under the waning moon.*
*State that they should leave while they still can.*
Dunno. I jus&apos; pull it out of muh hat.
Toyseller Sanders told us that for assistance with the other obstacles protecting Lucian&apos;s tomb, we need to talk to Arhu.
We helped Dallis? That&apos;s a kick in the teeth.
*The White Magister yanks his head towards the hanging man and snickers.*
Instantly kills your target
Priest
Oh no! Help!
*Tell her you&apos;ll always be her ally in that endeavour.*
Amadia forgive me - it&apos;s true! As he grew distant, I just pushed harder.
Grapes
*Remark that you get the impression she doesn&apos;t like Gareth very much.*
We found dead prisoners in Isbeil&apos;s laboratory.
*Tell him he has no reason to protect the Whites. They do &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;look after their own.*
Maggot, I am no slave!
Poor thing. Must be starved!
*She bows her head in silence.*
*Tell her you care about her, but not more than you care about yourself.*
Then listen for me. When the breeze blows clean, I will be upon it.
Book
It&apos;s all a joke. There&apos;s nothing to guard. Only lies. You&apos;ll see for yourself, once you&apos;re dead.
By the tears of the Gods. Then the Seekers are surely doomed. None of them shall leave this island.
Realm of Orobas
*Alexandar smiles at you, a familiar smile from when he was but a boy in his father Lucian&apos;s arms. For a moment your lips twitch automatically in return... until you remember all that led to this moment.*
But Dallis, in her great wisdom, granted us a gift.
Village - Cobblestone Streets
&lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; are &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; now. The spells you need to know I will teach you when you are ready, but first you must learn to channel the Source in greater volumes. That is why you need to seek Masters of the Source. You must make them teach you, so that you may become a Master in turn.
*Thank her for her guidance. You&apos;d have perished if it wasn&apos;t for her.*
I am glad you understand. &lt;i&gt;At last&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;ll admit. I&apos;ve had nightmares about it. But it was necessary.
Even after all these years, he still resents my taking his body. Mortals can be such petty creatures...
*Reach out to shake her outstretched hand.*
Make enemies around you cower and flee.
*The spirit stares down at his own corpse, a bemused look upon his face.*
Can I interest you in a short discussion about the merits of Tir-Cendelius, the poet of the woods, the god of the elves and others?
&lt;i&gt;You wear the armour - your intent is my intent. Your will is my will.&lt;/i&gt;
We found Lord Arhu imprisoned in Kemm&apos;s vault.
*Alright. You trust her to handle this discreetly.*
*Ask if he and Lucian realised they were being tricked into killing the elves as they destroyed the Black Ring.*
*Cry out for her to stop singing; you won&apos;t be hypnotised.*
*Say that he&apos;s free to do as he pleases.*
Soulmarrow Cage
I&apos;d ask Hannag. But it seems she&apos;s deserted me. Deserted my family. I&apos;ve no idea where she disappeared to. Maybe it&apos;s best I don&apos;t know.
Hmm... interesting...
[UNDEAD] *Imagining the alcohol has loosened your tongue (and that you have a tongue), admit you&apos;ve often wished for happiness.*
Grenade Holy
Halt! What word do you bring?
Tribute to a Guardian
Magister Aeromancer
By Lucian&apos;s sword, these Magisters are madmen! Are you alright, lizard?
*Decline. Say you&apos;re just not very thirsty at the moment.*
Tiny Leap
*The rush of power through your body - through your very soul - surprises and delights. You feel stronger. More capable. You have taken one more step towards ultimate power.*
*She presents herself with open arms, grinning maniacally even as tears run down her cheeks.*
Character&apos;s damage is increased by nearby characters.
*He cocks his head to one side, confusion and suspicion wrinkling up his fuzzy face.*
If the vertices were aligned correctly, then my runes &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt;... aaagh, this is impossible!
*You can tell the Red Prince contemplates violence for the briefest of moments before reconsidering.*
*&apos;Anyone found trespassing on these premises before her trial concludes shall be charged as an accomplice, and will share her fate.&apos;*
Then you won&apos;t sail with her! She ran the ship upon the rocks, although I rang the bell. That light weren&apos;t no lighthouse. I rang the bell in warning and she ran the ship upon the rocks!
