[RED PRINCE] *Tell her that after meeting with Stingtail, you came here in search of another, &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; dreamer.*
Yes, my lord Lucian, I&apos;m coming. I&apos;ll free you. I&apos;ll protect you. I&apos;m coming, my lord. I&apos;m coming, Lucian. I&apos;m coming. I&apos;m coming. Right after I...

[FANE] *Muse his words. Many people are strange, but can you truly say one is &lt;i&gt;stranger &lt;/i&gt;than another?*
&lt;i&gt;Why do you come, dwarf-&lt;/i&gt;breaker? &lt;i&gt;You who hollow the earth but are not of it?&lt;/i&gt;
Doesn&apos;t take too kindly to dwarves. Can&apos;t blame him. Make yourself useful to him, and he may change his tune.
She&apos;s the woman I love, damn you!
I only hope perhaps you find her before then.
You, Fane, the Eternal Divine.
He&apos;s got &lt;i&gt;the thing&lt;/i&gt;. You know. Some people see the world as it presents itself. Other people see it as it really is. Jahan&apos;s one of those.
Target gains 100% poison resistance for 2 turns.
That it is, and if you want to take my boat off this island, you&apos;ll consider me a privileged party.
*Offer him your companionship.*
*The warg snarls at you. Its muzzle is stained crimson with the blood of its enemies, its flank with blood of its own - the hilt of a sword protrudes from its back.*
[SCHOLAR] *Peering at her distinctive nose, ask if she&apos;s any relation to Jarbin Esthmyer, the famed magical scholar.*
You have done all that I have asked and more. I shall make good on our Covenant. After all the races are dominated, you shall take your place with us and rule them.
Saheila died before she could help us.

What do you mean he escaped? Every inch of this factory was being watched!
*You take her sins for your own and they fill you with power. And then she is gone.*
*Tell him to drop the sword and get his arse up that ladder &lt;i&gt;right now.*&lt;/i&gt;
Wind Deep Forest 01
We don&apos;t know where we&apos;re going, but we&apos;re definitely not going &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt;. There&apos;s no reason for anyone to go where we came from, unless they have a death wish.
Who knows? Letting it free might be a blessing in disguise.
Ravager
*The light from the candles dances in her dark eyes as she looks at you.*
I know you won&apos;t.
[You open what seems to be a map of the island. It&apos;s covered in strange, arcane runes, but it seems to show the location of three vaults, a forge, and some sort of archive.]
*Don&apos;t move. Breathe him in. His heady musk. His intoxicating aura. His very presence, tantalising and beguiling.*
You, my friend, have earned a front-row seat to today&apos;s performance!
*Fold your arms and stare at her expectantly.*
Consider for a moment &lt;i&gt;the dwarf&lt;/i&gt;. What is he? A mule; a beast of burden. But some defy that role. There are &lt;i&gt;rats&lt;/i&gt; among them, dancing to their rat queen&apos;s tune.
So? Heard any word about the stolen supplies? C&apos;mon, shortbread, out with it!
The Order has something you could never understand: a code.
[DWARF] *Swear on Queen Justinia&apos;s life that she can trust you.*
One against seven, one against all odds. I&apos;m starting to warm up to the God King actually.
*There&apos;s a curious-looking panel discreetly nestled upon the wall. Upon it is a lone button.*
Are you sure you want to start a game in Honour Mode? You can only have one Honour Mode save game per profile. When a party member dies, your Honour Mode save game will be overwritten. When all party members die, your Honour Mode save game will be deleted. You cannot change this setting once the game starts.
[OUTLAW] *Tell the cub it&apos;s a treacherous world. Trust no-one.*
*Protest: you already paid the toll.*
It&apos;s the least we could do. We&apos;ll never be able to repay you for what you&apos;ve done.
Heh. No indeed, boy. But &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;ain&apos;t my final destination.
Orifice manipulator - activated!
Think you&apos;re cute, do ye? Business is business; even the Magisters know that. Get shoppin&apos;, shrubsy, or leave me be.
*Grog drags a rough map in the dust of the bridge with one claw. He then spends an inordinate amount of time sketching a highly vulgar doodle of this &apos;Marg&apos; he wants you to take care of.*
It&apos;s the &lt;i&gt;Void&lt;/i&gt;. Nothing is safe from it.
But &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; almost got yourself killed back there. You should be more careful.
UI Add Stat Points
*You step from your hiding-place as the mob goes racing by, crying &apos;murderess&apos; and &apos;witch&apos; and &apos;hag&apos;. None but the younger men give you a second glance &lt;i&gt;(they &lt;/i&gt;give you a third glance, and a fourth).*
PEEP!

*Return his gaze in stern silence.*
The fog is lifting...
So make no mistake, dear Fane: the road to divinity may well mean the blood of those six traitors staining your ivory hands.

*Brahmos holds out one empty hand and chants in a low drone. Light flares and blossoms in his scaly palm, revealing: a &lt;i&gt;key&lt;/i&gt;. He hands it to the Red Prince with a solemn nod.*
*Argue that maybe the wizard had very important things to do.*
*She stands there, implacable, her icy gaze upon you. Deep in her pupils you fancy you can see... a burning flame.*
Peace highlights
*It looks at Fane, clicking and chittering in excitement, and introduces itself. Fane starts in shock - he knows it.*
*Try a different tactic.*

Enough have died so that we could get this far - I do not want to provoke more violence.
Hey! Wait - one sec. Ma. MA! Look!
Huh. Guess that one doesn&apos;t really end with a bang. But that&apos;s alright. It&apos;s a work in progress.
Your kind. And the elves and lizards besides. Those of you that&apos;d see the whole realm eaten up by the Voidwoken &apos;fore you&apos;d change your ways.
*As you coax the dial to the left, a second tumblr joins the first. This lock may yet yield its secrets to your touch.*
*Say that you found a ring belonging to one of the murdered Magisters - best that it be returned to her comrades.*
*In low tones, wonder what the hell is wrong with her.*
What do yeh think, Leya? Can yeh help?
The Meistr is dead, more&apos;s the pity. One with such an authoritative title could surely have aided us well. But even in her absence we must trace what it is that she knew somehow.
*The spirit floats before you. She seems all but spent.*
Driftwood is mostly the same as every other fishing town. It&apos;s got the same aroma, and the same herds of unwashed dwarves.
Ever heard of that place? Fort Joy? They send you there, means you ain&apos;t never coming back!
*Very well. Ask him how he wants to deepen your alliance.*
*Assure her that her eyes are fine. She was under Mordus&apos; thrall - but is now released.*
*In an instant, the ghostly imprint of pain and suffering is no more.*
*Ifan&apos;s lips curve in a sly smile. It would appear frightening, save for the bright twinkle of his eyes.*
*The guard growls faintly and stares at the scene before him without blinking.*
Fake Arrow
Setup brightness and contrast
That&apos;s the whole idea I&apos;m afraid. Even I myself thought it myth.
It is far more than a pile of bones! It was my finest creation, where death embraced life.
This very large potion, a beautiful, swirling concoction smelling faintly of coconuts, grants resistance to water damage.
*Say that you&apos;re going to investigate this strange decaying shroud first - removing it will make for an easier escape.*
*You open your eyes and look out over a swamp. The air is heavy, fetid, and choking.*
*Explain that you have some questions.*
*Take your leave.*
Rename
See that, elf? That&apos;s Magister flesh - loyal flesh that&apos;s made sacrifices for a true cause. You have more in common with insects and vermin than you do with me.
Mmmmmmm.
*Ignore the burning in your lungs and quickly explain what happened - the presence within you, your new power, and the Masters of Source*
*Maybe later.*
Good. Know that there are other Godwoken in the world. But &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the one who will be a god, none other. Keep your claws sharpened, my wolf. You&apos;ll need them.
Talk to the Ancestor Tree.
Yes, it does. You have been here with me through all of this. Thank you, my love.
[FANE] *Admit that any future would be better than your past, but thank him for his words.*
*Ask him what he&apos;ll do now he&apos;s free.*
*The Voidwoken seems to sense that you won&apos;t make it. It unleashes an outraged screech, then releases you from it&apos;s grasp.*
Well, you know what to do. Unless... unless you &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to pay the big bucks?

Spirit Vision: Finding Ghosts
We found a single bottle of the witch&apos;s potion.
Alexandar is dead. This time for good.
Not quite.
When we came to Arx, to prepare, she rarely left my side, except to tend to her laboratory. I&apos;d no idea what... what atrocities she&apos;d been committing there...
Self-Made Two-Handed Club
You there, kinsman. A word!
Gods help yer! This place ain&apos;t like home. We&apos;re at the bottom of the totem pole here, next to the snake-faces and moss-munchers. I got m&apos;self a cushy spot on Griff&apos;s guard, but few dwarves&apos;re so lucky.
*The angelic figure stands upon a mosaic that depicts a dragon - or a leviathan.*
*Tell her the truth: Probably not, all things considered.*
*The spirit seizes the pain you inflict upon it and turns it back on you. The pain you share nears unbearable levels - and the spirit begins to smile. This is the pinnacle of its existence - *
*Ask if there&apos;s anything she can do to help the people here.*
*A look of terror overcomes the girl&apos;s features as she finds herself lurching towards you, as if her feet move against her will.*
Of course he&apos;ll be so kind. Speak freely, kinsman!
*Tell it you require plain answers, not poetic mumbles. Cry out its name: Xhaxh!*
*Grab him by the shoulders. No. He couldn&apos;t know this would happen - he&apos;s not at fault.*
Magical Metal Shield

[RED PRINCE] *Tell her you have sung many such songs - to as many scars.*
He was... killed quite mercilessly by a young companion. A trader - the young man wanted to seize his business.
*Tell him his allies are dead.*
[IFAN] *Tell him he&apos;d be wise to take a more respectful tone with the Silver Claw.*
None
The gods themselves were corrupt, and even Lucian could fare no better than them.
*Ask about the kraken at the harbour.*
You are about to leave for a higher level area. If you have unfinished business in the Hall of Echoes, you should take care of it before venturing forth. Are you ready to leave?
*Ask what he may spare you for the fight ahead.*
*The spirit tries to flee. She makes it no more than a couple of paces before she is consumed.*
Set target health
*Tell her you plan to enjoy what you&apos;ve earned. Divine power suits you.*
I know taste when I see it! Care to trade?
[BARBARIAN] *Divulge you&apos;re of the opinion every Magister should be boiled alive.*
One moonless night, the succubus that was my lover turned to me, fangs exposed, but I could tell from the glint in her eyes she wasn&apos;t bent on our usual fang-play.
Redbrand Ranger
*You see a grinning squirrel looking up at you. The cat seems pretty pleased with itself too.*
*You recall the eyes of the dwarves: black until death, when they faded to normal...*
We collected feathers from the corpse of Duna’s Undertaker. They appear to be cursed.
