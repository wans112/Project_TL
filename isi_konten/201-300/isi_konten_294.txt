*The boy shakes his head in denial, then beams like the summer sun. Impossibly, your heart stirs at the sight of a young child confined to a cage.*
You show your face here, cursed one? I hear you are the one that returned Gareth to his flock.
*Click.*
Heeheehee! A little boogie?! EW! Heeheehee!
*The sister has found peace with what was her life, but her brother rages on. The rebellion was a disaster. His sister&apos;s treason cost them their lives.*
Target cannot be teleported ([1])
I got years of fishin&apos; experience behind me, an&apos; I&apos;m reduced to beggin&apos; to gut &apos;n&apos; clean what catches make it back.

And so I must trust it to be done.
*Tell him his duty is over before it began. You already met with Brahmos again.*
*Tell her half the truth. Say you met Tir-Cendelius, god of the elves, and he called you his champion. Leave off the part where he told you to get rid of Lohse.*
*Note the hiss. Peer closely at his tongue.*
Let me guess. It failed?
*She looks to your left with one eye, and to your right with the other.*
Bromley
[JESTER] *Tell her that you&apos;re a jester who&apos;s roamed all over this land.*
&lt;i&gt;I see you.&lt;/i&gt; You have the strength I&apos;ve been looking for.
*Thank him for his service. Tell him he has done his duty.*
Crafty Weaponry: Die by the Sword
*A memory, though not your own. Horror and anger wash over you. Seven figures point to you, just as the blue-grey obelisks surrounding you begin to bow and break...*
But... if I&apos;m dead, who&apos;ll look after the child?!
*You blink, and there she really is: not the person you thought you went to bed with, but &lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt;: the Red Princess.*
I have rights! You&apos;ve no authority to storm in here like this!
Is this some kind of joke? Hand it over. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
*Say you need more information than that. Who does he mean?*
To you I am this pressing pain you wish would go away - but won&apos;t.
*Joke with him. You hope it goes better than when he was scouting Fort Joy!*
A word, if I may. I know you&apos;re anxious to leave for the Nameless Isle, but I can feel I have unfinished business here.
[MYSTIC] *Finish the Magister&apos;s rite. &apos;...and so on your flesh it must feed.&apos;
I&apos;ll remember...
Wait, Milady!
He gave every last copper piece to that swine! I&apos;ve got &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.
*Alexandar offers only a stoic nod in affirmation, his eyes glowering intensely.*
[NOBLE] *Tell him you value coin for what it denotes: &lt;i&gt;pedigree.*&lt;/i&gt;
Circle Dagger
The Void, though... it&apos;s closing in. Voidwoken roam the land and pollute the sea. That they haven&apos;t invaded the town is... a miracle.

Heh. You&apos;re no royal. Not anymore. A Beast you were - and a Beast you remain.
To cross this threshold is to plunge into thy grave. Do not decide in haste.
There&apos;s no hope of going back that way.
*Seems... logical? Draw your weapon and prepare to strike.*
Stun targets in a [2] radius and deal [1] to them. Creates a small oil puddle with a [3] radius.
Demons are weak and easy to manipulate. I wouldn&apos;t put too much stock in it.

Didn&apos;t ye hear me on the first go-round?
We have escaped Fort Joy. We will no longer be able to help Fara with her troubles.
Let me have a look. It takes just a moment.
If they were smart, they would&apos;ve killed us outright.
*A rather poetic description of the common salamander and its impressive - at least to the uninitiated - Voidwoken cousin.*
[SEBILLE] *Smile and say that a trial sounds like fun. Shakes up the routine of being the executioner.*
*The Magister&apos;s eyes narrow and her lip curls as she assesses you.*
But they&apos;ll kill me! And if I&apos;m dead, who&apos;ll look after the child?!
You? It is you, isn&apos;t it? You can hide that skull all you want, but I see you.
Paladin Cleric
*Lean in and gently kiss her.*
Off to Arx, then. Got two ladies there in need of a dressing-down!

*Declare that you&apos;re innocent - you&apos;ve never seen that necklace before in your life!*
Missin&apos; hat, natty beard, vessel adrift. It&apos;s a sea cap&apos;n&apos;s worst nightmare, it is!
*Kemm mentioned a certain Lord Arhu. What more can he tell you about him?*
We came across a wrecked caravan. The mutilated dead litter the ground. What happened here?
*The spirit offers no resistance, but instead spreads his arms as if to welcome his fate.*
We convinced the Magisters to leave.
As well you should! I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like elves, for instance.
No, I won&apos;t end my vigil over the door. You shan&apos;t pass.
Whatcha want?
*Say that in his current condition, in a place like this, his only job is to stay alive.*
*Speak slowly and loudly. Who. Are. You?*
I&apos;d love nothing more after what they did... but it&apos;d be suicide. I have to choose my battles - I&apos;m here to gather information, not to fight.

Gods, gods, gods, that&apos;s good.
*... and suddenly, within the cloak&apos;s shadows, there is light. A flash of teeth. A wicked grin. Suddenly you realise he&apos;s...*
Hmm... you&apos;re an impressive specimen, Godwoken. I can always spot when a pupil has put effort into developing their strength. Bravo.
Perhaps we can use our new power on the cursed lever.
So?
*Ask who he is.*
*He pauses for a moment, then gently takes your hand from his cheek, holds it a moment, and drops it.*
*Your god mentioned something about a well. Ask if she knows about it.*
I can always count on you, can&apos;t I. Always.
Mouldering Executor
My, but you didn&apos;t even hear what I had in mind.
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll nest in your soul.&lt;/i&gt;
You think you&apos;re the Divine-in-waiting, but you&apos;re just another pawn. A stooge for Arhu and the Seekers, those arch-traitors. They&apos;re the enemies of Divinity. And so, Godwoken, are you.
Bearded Wolf&apos;s Head Axe
A survivalist and a practitioner of magic, the Wayfarer is hard to hit and even harder to evade.
They were corrupted somehow. If it could happen to them, it could happen to us. We should be cautious.
*Lie and tell him you saw nothing fishy at all on the way here. No sir.*

&lt;i&gt;TREACHERY!&lt;/i&gt;
The elf, Elodi, told us of a safe place where we can talk safely.
In the Hall of Echoes, my parasite gave me Spirit Vision to commune with spirits and Source Vampirism to consume their Source.
None of your business.
Adept Rogue
Can&apos;t help you there. *Ahem* If I could, I wouldn&apos;t be here peeling goddamn potatoes.
No. Find your true love and forget my kiss. Remember only the blessing I gave you.
Kemm&apos;s Vault
*Claim that her stew is phenomenal and wax lyrical about the flavours you couldn&apos;t truly experience. Ask her what her secret is.*
Please, what I have is more valuable than any coin purse. It can be yours, just get me out of here!
Your quarry lies on a far off shore, at the heart of the Nameless Isle. It is a place no-one can reach unless their soul becomes their compass.

The exorcism failed, but Jahan asked to travel with me to Arx, where the demon is hiding.
You may.
*Ask why not.*
*She looks up at you with a mirthless smile.*
It appears you&apos;re free without realising it, Saheila. The Mother is quite dead.
Patience, my friend! Plant the seedling in the bucket, and place it in the ground. Then watch and listen - the wisdom of plants is mighty indeed!
Dead Squirrel
The younger the meat, the purer the power, mortal.
Awrite, sister! Right glad Lohar ain&apos;t left us here to wither.
*Ask if you reject your God, can she get her out of you?*
I... I see her. She&apos;s in a city. There&apos;s a great cathedral...
At least... it&apos;s quite... quite &lt;i&gt;beautiful &lt;/i&gt;here, isn&apos;t it.

Well then, if we&apos;re going to be &lt;i&gt;friends,&lt;/i&gt; let me mark your map. See this place? There are others hiding there. You should join them. You&apos;re welcome.

You know what it means to be on my skin... The names... They are Scions?
Don&apos;t you understand? The Wolves know we are here. We cannot enter their base. They slaughter us, and Saheila stays with them.
Mind yourself.
Return the rest of my power to me.
I enjoy living grandly. I know these aren&apos;t... ordinary servants. But I prefer the... &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt;ordinary. There is no pleasure in mediocrity. Don&apos;t you agree... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt;
You need not hide fear. You see that you serve no one. You are first of many -
You&apos;ll be sorry you ever spoke to me that way, by the time this is done.
If Hardwin were to receive her head, it would make his day. I&apos;ll leave that with you.

They kicked me out! Don&apos;t they know who I am?

My lord, you will not let this... this commoner tell you how to proceed with your very destiny, will you?
*The skeleton pulls a notebook from his robes and starts scribbling. After a moment he pauses and looks back to you.*
