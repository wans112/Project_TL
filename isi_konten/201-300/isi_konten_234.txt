Earnan
Verdas is dead. It seems that he was important for some reason, but it remains unclear to us for now.
What&apos;s the hold-up? Snap snap, cupcake.
*Ask the dwarf if he can help you get the collar off.*
*And suddenly the tide reverses. It is your own memories bearing down on you now, crushing you beneath the weight of every trauma, every regret, every &lt;i&gt;failure.&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her the particulars don&apos;t matter. It&apos;s just a general feeling.*
Cannibalise
A god, perhaps. *Winks*
*Ask her what happened here.*
Unequip
*Say you&apos;ve changed your mind about freeing the elf; you&apos;d prefer cash.*
[IFAN] *Rescuer? Deflect the question and tell him you&apos;re nothing of the sort.*
Come now. Nothing you&apos;ve done has been your own. You owe every note, every show, to the voices inside you. Visitors like me. &lt;i&gt;We &lt;/i&gt;make you great. You know that.
Those shards look pretty sharp...
What makes you think...? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are not &lt;i&gt;her,&lt;/i&gt; so don&apos;t you dare take such liberties with me!
Take your theories up with Magister Carver, if you wish. I have better things to do.
The pages of this tome are adorned with musical notation and elegant calligraphy.
*The flaming figure emits no heat, yet your bones seem to sizzle if you draw too near.*
Oh, it&apos;s easy. We link up souls and share our innermost beliefs. Think of it like an innocent little duel. The winner remains comfortable with their personal truths.
Wait to see what happens next.
We learned that the Magisters have been taking Purging Wands dating from the time of Braccus Rex from the armouries and caches scattered around the island. Perhaps they overlooked some.
You bribe your way into an early tomb, criminal!
FORWARD!
They worshipped that girl like she were their flesh-munching god himself.
I was waylaid by House of Shadows assassins! I must find and slay whoeverâ€™s behind this foul conspiracy against my royal person.
*As he watches the encyclopedia sink into the ocean&apos;s dark heart, Fane pulls out his own notebook, opens it, and tears out the first page...*
*A man&apos;s pale face floats high above you in the gloom. He smiles and offers you his long-fingered, long-nailed hand. You know this is the God King&apos;s sallow envoy. There is no choice to make.*
We should get moving soon - this place mightn&apos;t be as safe as it looks.
*Ignoring the meat, ask what else he carries on him.*
How could he? &lt;i&gt;How could he?!&lt;/i&gt;
Wonderful. But I must ask some... &lt;i&gt;uncomfortable&lt;/i&gt; questions. Are you ready to answer?
&lt;i&gt;...good evening... godwoken... i trust you sleep well...&lt;/i&gt;
*Master? Is she in the thrall of a Magister?*
Hired Assassin
*Ask if he&apos;d like to join your party.*
Sinew
I&apos;m... glad I still have people I can call family.
*Scoffs* Didn&apos;t you know? When they take your life, your family, the clothes on your goddamn back away from you, your dignity goes along with it.
Laaaaa... la-laaa...
Never killed that pigeon-feather Marg for me...
Demon Hound
*The graveyard&apos;s deathchill fades, leaving within you only hope and forgiveness.*
Oh goodie! You&apos;re a good boy. Yes you are! Who&apos;s a good boy, then? You! That&apos;s who!
*Beg her forgiveness.*
They haven&apos;t &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; met me.
The sooner I find my brethren, the better - if they&apos;re even still alive...
[VILLAIN] *Say that it was a lot safer for her before you arrived.*
Eep. Eeep eep.
*Another snap. Different fingers; different sound. She looks to the ground? She&apos;s... She&apos;s bowing before him!*
Hah! What I mean is... look, you&apos;ve never been a... a host, right? That&apos;s cause you&apos;re like... a clump of leaves on the side of the road. That ain&apos;t bad though. I&apos;d give just about anything to be like you.
Saheila thanked us for saving her and wished us well.
I was hoping you&apos;d come find us again. I&apos;ve never known a god before they became divine. I was curious if it would have changed you.
&apos;Here lies Marjolinea Pruitt.&lt;br&gt;Who won many battles&lt;br&gt;At the bridge and elsewhere.&apos;
We escaped without Gawin&apos;s help.
*Note that while you&apos;re short, you&apos;re not in danger of being snatched away by a seagull... unlike some people.*
[ELF] *Shake your head. Her carelessness cost lives!*
*Offer her an entire bag of gold coins.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82])
Contract&apos;s a contract. &lt;i&gt;Two,&lt;/i&gt; in this case. Easy money. Been running since the Great War, too. Each of your kind gets me a hefty sum.
What part of &apos;talk sense&apos; passed you by, bark-brain? I ain&apos;t killing me brothers and, if I stay right here, they ain&apos;t killing me.
&lt;b&gt;NOOO!&lt;/b&gt;
In your godsdamned dreams, you shameless little...
You one of her little Seekers? Chasing down Godwoken and beggin&apos; &apos;em to save us all?
*Ask why one of their own lies bloodied on the floor.*
*Huge claws wrap around your chest and squeeze. With your ribs about to shatter, an orb of pure energy appears in your palm.*
Godwoken? Heh. Stay on the current course, and you&apos;ll be the death of us all.
Stop that prisoner!
*Tell her you don&apos;t have time for this. You&apos;ll take your leave.*
*He holds the apple to your lips. It feels not cool and dry, but warm and wet. And more - it tastes of fear.*
You and me, chief. We got this.
I knew it was you! So they&apos;re lettin&apos; just any ol&apos; riff-raff into this joint now, eh?
*Bow your head. He was an honourable man.*
Of course. I must depart post-haste, but Julian here will stay behind and be a good little parrot. Ask, and he will answer.
Now if you&apos;ll excuse me I, uh... I have some research to do.
You&apos;ve unlocked the Hall of Heroes. If you &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;dismiss&lt;/font&gt; your companions, they will come here to rest.
Go then. Get out of here.
This is how Lucian - even in death! - will become the saviour of us all: with him, all Source will wither. With him, divinity itself will die.
*Inform her that this is no dream - she is dead. If she tells you what she knows about the Black Ring, then you will release her.*
Altar to Rhalic
*She takes a shuddering breath and idly itches her face. You&apos;d expect her cheeks to be ruddy from tears, but they are pale instead, almost translucent, revealing the vessels snaking underneath.*
*Enough talking, just give her a bear hug.*
Too quiet for my liking. Then again, it usually is.
Infused with falcons&apos; tears, this medium-sized elixir infuses its drinker with superior speed.
*She disappeared without a trace. Finding her back will be a long shot at best.*

Here - I&apos;ll mark your map. If you change your mind, you&apos;ll know just where to look.
*Isbeil&apos;s voice rises and her fists tighten. You presume she&apos;d have gone red with fury, were she not wholly translucent.*
What makes you think a noble creature of the land would want to associate with a devil like you?
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
You&apos;ve found a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Trap Disarming Kit&lt;/font&gt;! If you spy a trap: use the Trap Disarming Kit from your inventory, then select the trap.
*Growl that you could have the Magister over here in a few moments.*
*Turn away and take your leave.*
Hey, stranger. Glad to see you. No Reds in the offing yet; don&apos;t imagine they&apos;ll stay gone, though.
Search the cave.
A guest... how brazen of you to enter without knocking.
My crowning glory and the millstone around my neck. Yes, I made the bomb. I served Lucian as best I could. I gave him what he asked. Would I do it again?
I don&apos;t want to hear another word out of you, prisoner. Not. One. &lt;i&gt;Word!&lt;/i&gt;
Did you suppose you silenced me with your pitiable display of force? Were you so naive as to think I would not come to watch my comrades make the ultimate sacrifice?
*Tell her you just aren&apos;t interested in the story.*
We found the Paladins under Voidwoken attack.
At the start of each turn, launches a fiery projectile at the nearest ally with an active Hard Place status.
That Voidwoken had someone in its claws!
GREETINGS PAULINA KEMM - LADY OF THE HOUSE - WISE AND GENTLE
Sure. And when they do, they&apos;ll disappear too.
But instead, I became part of their story...
Sure I have. Biggest one of her kind.
*Tell her there are no kings on this island. All that is left are their ruins.*
Noticed that, did you? For future reference: if I don&apos;t answer a question, it&apos;s because I don&apos;t want to.
Fan of Knives
*A swirl of intoxication travels up your spine and into your head. You set yourself straight and turn your face toward hers.*
Poisoned Cup of Honeyed Milk
*Ask her what she makes of the new god of the realm.*
Beast carries papers warning of &apos;Operation Downfall&apos;. The Driftwood criminal Lohar may be involved.
*Grins.* Buy me a drink when you get paid, if we&apos;re still alive and away from this place. That&apos;ll be thanks enough.
Glad to hear you say that. I guess it was pretty obvious by now.
[SWORN] *Tell the statue you serve the God King and no other.*
That it did. I was to hurry through the forests with a rift portal for the elves, so they could escape before the Deathfog exploded.

*She moans impatiently and taps her bony foot.*
Elegant Dwarven Key
Forever, Fane... you can live forever with us...
*Look surprised and tell her this is just how you talk.*
Cancel Action
*Say you suspect there&apos;s more to this situation than meets the eye. Suggest he tell you if your suspicions are correct.*
Like a godsdamn gold star inn for the disembodied.
*Behind the containers, the fish in one of the barrels shift slightly.*
Ah... the Path of Blood is a, eh, &lt;i&gt;more advanced&lt;/i&gt; form of pilgrimage. I would not advise it, unless you believe yourself to be free from sin. And trust me, none are free from sin.
Foggy
*No sooner have these words left your mouth than she turns about and grabs you in a stranglehold. You feel the tip of a long needle being pushed a little ways into one of your neck&apos;s vertebrae.*
*This must be Donna, the one spoken of by the Paladins guarding the door.*
Dwarf an&apos; a elf is a dwelf.
The spirit of a great stag sent us in search of a halo of wildflowers.
Rusty Sword
*Protest. Is he sure it was Jonathan he saw?*
Well, hello. Care to get a little... fresh? If that&apos;s not too... cheesy?
*Stand your ground.*
We&apos;ve made a pact - I won&apos;t have a choice. Besides, that&apos;s a house-call I don&apos;t want to miss.
*The little black cat trailing you hisses at him, hair raising a ridge along its back. Without batting an eyelid, the man rumbles a lupine growl. The cat hides behind your leg, mewling.*
&lt;i&gt;Get the hell away from me, lizard!&lt;/i&gt; Only place in Arx for your lot&apos;s at the end of a rope.
Be careful on the road, stranger. You&apos;re safe enough in here, but past the bridge you&apos;re on your own.
*She rubs a hand over her smooth head, then suddenly looks up at you. Her great greenish-gold eyes are alive with worry.*
I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m sorry that I didn&apos;t realise the truth of him.
Bloody Reds! Bloody, buggering, bastardly Reds! But you ain&apos;t to blame, lass, I know that! You tried, and that&apos;s more than I did. Damn shame though. Damn shame.
I can&apos;t believe that Lucian would do that. To lie to me? To use me? I &lt;i&gt;ran&lt;/i&gt;. I &lt;i&gt;tried&lt;/i&gt;. And all along, the annihilation of the elves was in my hands. He must have been set up.
*Ask the rat the question: to which tune does the ship dance?*
I had no idea. What a fool I am.
In life, we are the earth&apos;s caretakers. In death, we are the sky&apos;s.
