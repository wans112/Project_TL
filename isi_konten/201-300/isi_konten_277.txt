*Ask the lizard what&apos;s on his mind.*
Decide what to do with Adramahlihk&apos;s soul candles.
*Praise him for his sterling performance of his duties. Tell him he&apos;s earned shore leave.*
*Note the odd smell you whiffed in his garden - Deathfog!*
Only the Beast knows the truth.
Emrach
*Turn and walk away. This is altogether too irrational for you.*
&lt;i&gt;This is not the time for talk. Kill him - &lt;b&gt;now!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s time for us to go, little one. The Magisters will return. Evil always does.
I applaud your empathy, Godwoken,  but that was the most ungainly display I&apos;ve borne witness to in a long time...
*Say you may, depending on what he&apos;s interested in. But there are things you want to know, too.*
Kills
*Insist that no kin should apologise for offering food and shelter to lesser beasts.*
Too many things have gone wrong along Reaper&apos;s Coast to attribute to bad luck: Magister ships sinking; weapons disappearing; and as you&apos;ve seen: a caravan attacked and destroyed.
*Say her instincts are mistaken. You&apos;re just you, no better or worse than usual.*
My, what spirit. I admire it, even if it is utterly misguided. At least we&apos;ll put it to very good use; I can assure you of that.
Paladins march on the Blacks and Reds, hurrah! Hurrah!
*Knock on the door.*
They died knowing they were loved.
The One will walk among us, though not today, it seems.
Sounds good to me. I know a safe place on the outside. Maybe we&apos;ll meet up there and you can tell me how it went.
My advice is to strike before he even has a chance to speak, but should you choose to disregard me, should you allow him to parley, all you have to do is say &apos;no&apos;.
Freedom. I can hardly remember what it tastes like.
*She blanks you once more.*
*She stares at you in horror, trying to work out if you&apos;re joking or not... and then realises that her breathing has slowed. The panic is gone.*
Slane the Winter Dragon is dead.
*Shrug; you like shiny things.*
Eithne is dead. She has no need of the book.
*Indeed they did. Ask what he wants in return - that seems to be the way of things here.*
*Say you&apos;ve never heard of &apos;Seekers&apos; until today - what are they?*
*She closes her eyes and settles back to sleep.*
There&apos;s nothing inna chest, &apos;retty lady! So don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
Dallis cared for their bodies
*He lets it fly at some towering invisible horror visible only in his mind&apos;s eye. He reaches for another arrow...*
Conjures a trusty personal demon and elemental totems to aid in battle
*So that&apos;s it? He hid in a hole while his comrades died?*
*Drain the spirit - you could use the Source.*
Gloves of the Faithful
Your Highness! Good to see you again.
Spirit of Brahmos
Cute blade. I gather you&apos;re guarding quite the prize with it?
I have died once before - I do not fear it. I am just glad to die free.
A couple of White traitors doesn&apos;t mean every Magister is in league with the Ring!
*You see a dwarf, trying to sneak into a room filled with barrels. Barrels covered in the marks of death. There is a distant shout and he bolts - scrabbling for freedom.*
Then you know what you have to do. Ascend. It&apos;s the only way.
Those Paladins have gone too bloody far, elf. Arx will end up in ruins with that lot in charge...
I must retrieve my mask from the witch, or craft a new one from Source orbs and the ripped-off faces of the dead.
Ignition
*Tell him he&apos;s wrong. You&apos;re going to be Divine and he can step aside or die.*
Be in good health, dwarf.
If you would be so kind... *Cough*
Hate to cut this short, but I ought to dash off. My boy&apos;s waiting for me.
[BEAST] *Roar in anger. He knew Justinia was shipping Deathfog &lt;i&gt;this whole time?*&lt;/i&gt;
The Godwoken would fill your head with lies, Your Majesty. He merely wishes to cast doubt on our successful strategem.
Import
*The reaver gives you a silent, mirthless, malevolent laugh, tossing the heart from one hand to the other like a ball.*
*Stare at him in contempt and remark you remain a Prince of the House. He must bow before you!*
Hey, chief. &apos;member a little while ago, when I told you I might go it alone if things didn&apos;t change between us? Well... I really meant it.
[1] succumbed to death.
*Say that you&apos;re not quite sure... there&apos;s something there that might be a mouth...*
&lt;i&gt;What kind of person does the lying?&lt;/i&gt;
You really should keep your hands out of other people&apos;s pockets. You&apos;re under arrest!
Normally I&apos;ve a hollow leg, but I&apos;m afraid I couldn&apos;t swallow another morsel unless it were &lt;i&gt;particularly &lt;/i&gt;worth my while.
*Pull.*
Oh, that makes me so happy! Nothing is more important to Four Sisters than happy customers.
My new father-in-law Micheil Ros must die, and you must retrieve his will. I will not prescribe the methods you use, but I &lt;i&gt;shall&lt;/i&gt; insist on your discretion. Now tell me: what payment do you require for this service?
An exhaustive manual concerning how to make your own clothes. Interesting reading material sure is hard to come by around these parts.
Total
That&apos;s right.
Estocs are most customarily used for backstabbing. Just like all aristocrats&apos; tongues.
[NOBLE] *Tell her that you came from a high-born house, and never thought you&apos;d end up here...*
Today? Another time, perhaps. Next week or next month. If you leave a name and address, I&apos;ll see what I can arrange. But today is &lt;i&gt;Lucian&apos;s Day,&lt;/i&gt; and Arhu must give counsel to the lost. He cannot be disturbed.
I told yeh, lass. We&apos;ll be headin&apos; home in no time!
*Give him an easy smile and say that&apos;d be a terrible waste of your talents...*
Trophy
What&apos;ll it be, mercenary? A bow? A few feet of sharp steel? Something to bludgeon with, maybe?
I will &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;allow it to be disrespected.
If you don&apos;t like the game, Topsy, you can fold.
Goblin Spider Tamer
A fair exchange.
You must be ruthless, where I was not.
Onwards?
We&apos;ve been through a lot together, for better or worse. I don&apos;t know if either of us could&apos;ve made it this far on our own. I won&apos;t forget that, no matter what happens.
*Peer into the room and ask what happened.*
It is under a city, not within it, that ya might find buried its greatest riches.
Hey! What are you doing?
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Winged keeper, song doth bid you break.&lt;br&gt;The priest shall scry the demon&apos;s lies; the chains await their captive.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*You don&apos;t care what you&apos;re up against - you&apos;re here for the adventure.*
*Shrug, and leave him to his work.*
She... she... she... she and her... her... her... her &lt;i&gt;traitor!&lt;/i&gt;
Make it &lt;i&gt;stop.&lt;/i&gt;
Curious Chest
&lt;i&gt;You have spoken to a God?&lt;/i&gt;
Belt of Talent
*Tell her that you haven&apos;t had a real home in years.*
At any cost. You don&apos;t learn, do you? &lt;i&gt;At any cost.&lt;/i&gt; A symphony to any demon&apos;s ear.
A vial of blood labelled &apos;Beast&apos;
There&apos;s nothing we can do about it now, so we may as well press on.
Magister William
You&apos;re kidding, right?
But rest assured, your help is not needed. My Paladins will find her, and she will face Divine justice.
*Tell him you don&apos;t have the jar, but you&apos;ll go back for it.*
A world full of Sourcerers, that&apos;s quite a thing... but don&apos;t worry darling, you&apos;re still special to me.
An end to tyranny!
Speak with Garvan.
Armor (platemail)
Play the Lute to Encourage and Heal your allies. This will also damage nearby enemy Undead.
*The squirrel smiles, nods, and pats you on the leg.*
All set?
To see you dress... Truly the world has never witnessed a greater crime.
There are voices in many things. Talking straw is quite new to me though.
*The elf straightens to his full height; martial and unwavering.*
That-... That is a surprising spurt of logic from one of your kind.
Dorian Gall is dead.
I thought these bloody collars were supposed to keep those things at bay.
*Hand over the jar as she puts her mask back on. She looks like she&apos;s suffered enough.*
Necklace of Wine
*...but the sky is already thick with Magister arrows...*
The Red Prince and I didnâ€™t exactly see eye to eye. He left the party for good.
We&apos;re wanted. Wonderful.
*Your Source drains into the machine. It dims ever so slightly, but the shield remains steadfast.*
*Ask about this song - the &apos;Taming&apos;. What happens if you sing it?*
*The spirit turns and desperately scrambles for more projectiles.*
*Tell her you don&apos;t care where she got it, but you do need to buy it.*
*Kneel before her.*
*Apologise for disturbing him.*
*Ask about this goddess Amadia.*
*Look around. You don&apos;t see Malady - where did she go?*
Daddy! Daddy! Lookie lookie at &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
Paladins - Easy
&apos;A symposium on the anatomy of the human body.&apos;
*Ask why the groom might have wreaked such havoc.*
Good luck on the Path of Blood, pilgrim. May you discover that you&apos;re truly free from sin. Although, looking at you... that seems unlikely.
But M-a-a-a-a.
*The creature perks up, blinking rapidly with anticipation.*
*The beast goes silent and looks toward the nearby panel.*
But that is no reason to trust it - giants like that destroyed our forests. They are the very reason the Great Acorn is returning in all its wrath!
It&apos;s true.
*Tell her Braccus Rex is dead. Why does she still do the Source King&apos;s bidding?*
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you, Ifan. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
*Ask if those two poor creatures lurking in the chamber are playmates of his as well.*
*Tell him he&apos;s been very naughty and should get those clothes off immediately... and also very slowly.*
*He claims the Magisters put a collar on him. Ask was that a lie.*
My ma is dead. It&apos;s my fault.
*Ask how much she&apos;d be willing to pay.*
Fore!
He contained the demon and its blood spawn to the doomed shores of the isle, surrounded it with Deathfog, and never looked back.
Give Justinia&apos;s letter to the Magisters.
(I know they&apos;re still here.) My apologies for my idiot friend, but we really could use your help.
Spirit of a Royal Protector
I think you&apos;ll find something interesting there. Found some goodies during life number six. Now, if you don&apos;t mind... I need a bit of &apos;me time&apos;.
To the Mountain
*Ask them where you can find their witch.*
*Soon you spy it: the solitary red eye. The haven in the horror. That is where you are headed.*
*Its head leisurely lolls toward you in response, its glowing eyes revealing surprise at your knowledge of the tongue.*
*Agree.*
*Sebille trembles, all rage and pent up emotions.*
Why, selling you some cheese, of course!
[VILLAIN] *Offer him a nice, quick disembowelment.*
*He watches you depart without a word, then turns back to face the sea.*
[BEAST] *Tell her you&apos;re not sure. You don&apos;t believe in one person having too much power. But if that person were a champion of the &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;...*
Your talent for following simple instructions fills me with wonder and pride.
Sallow Man
This is... this is awful! I can&apos;t go back into the world like &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;.
We defeated Alexandar and his forces. We should be able to escape the island now. Let&apos;s just hope that the Seekers managed to take over the ship. We are to regroup at the shore.
*Tell her the Shadow Prince is dead. You ate his heart.*
Speak with Crispin.
Don&apos;t make this goodbye harder than it has to be. Just hand over the contract and I&apos;ll be on my way.
