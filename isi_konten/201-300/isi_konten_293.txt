Come, Godwoken. There is work to be done.
*Alexandar speaks with the insincere friendliness of a wizard selling spider venom and calling it a cure-all. &lt;i&gt;&apos;My girl, Tarlene is dead to us, along with the rest of the Seekers.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Ignore his remark, and question if that&apos;s his blood upon his hands.*
Did you hear that the ship is &lt;i&gt;alive?&lt;/i&gt; I don&apos;t understand... but no matter, as long as we can get away from here.
Voidwoken? That means Source was used... Which means some third party must have attacked first, and I&apos;ve a fair idea who that might have been.
Eternal Fire
Hrrm... n-never mind - you&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/i&gt;. I should have guessed...
I hope you&apos;re not still upset, stranger. Your help&apos;s been invaluable, trust me.
Haven&apos;t the dead suffered enough already? Why should we bother them?
The winning Godwoken sealed the Veil and banished the Void. Will peace reign with Rivellon shorn forever of Source? Time, as always, will tell.
*Smirk and say you&apos;re not looking to help Magisters - the more that vanish, the better.*
It is a strange moment. Elves travel far from home - or they are taken. I hope you are well, dear one.
That&apos;ll be worth a pretty penny.
*Ask him what exactly he does here in Driftwood.*
Ancient Hallway
The Gods parted the clouds and let a ray of sunshine through. My beloved Gwydian&apos;s safe.
Well, I was giving this concert up on Overlook Hill. There was a great crowd - they were really &lt;i&gt;feeling &lt;/i&gt;it.
*Say haughtily that you cannot fathom such a thing. What a rude accusation!*
*You got what you wanted. Leave him to witness it.*
The temple must hold. The temple must hold. The temple must hold.

Stone Defender

*Take your leave.*
CAW! RAKAW!
It seems we&apos;re not the only ones taking on strays.
Dwarves leave their dead for the birds to consume? How... barbaric!
*He looks at you sidelong, brow furrowing.*
*Smile disarmingly; say that you&apos;re just making conversation.*
Captain Ablewether is dead. Maybe her spirit lingers.
Squeeeeeeeeee!
Look, it&apos;s been a long one. Maybe I&apos;ll just enjoy my drink, if you don&apos;t mind. Captain Orell will be more useful to you than me.
A large-sized potion that restores your vitality. It makes a soft, tinkling sound when you shake it.
Very well. Lead on.
Got a map? There&apos;s a pull-y thing here, and then a pool with no water and a hatch in it. Easy.
So, here we are, my darling. Sourcerers, like everyone else in the realm.
Royal Blue
Damn. That&apos;s intense. I like you.
*Tell her the Covenant is a lie; it brings only death.*
I do believe my notes can wait.
If I never see an udder again it&apos;ll be too soon.
She hated it when I joined the Paladins. Hated the idea of me going to war.

I&apos;m listening.
Battlemage
Electrify a surface
So good of you to come, Godwoken. You know, you are many things - but above all you are... reliable. Reliable to the point of being predictable. You came to the Wellspring. I followed.
*Fane&apos;s words are quiet, but you hear the blacksmith repeat &apos;face-ripper?!&apos; in shock. She slowly backs away.*
*Dying? Worriedly ask her what&apos;s happening.*
*Tell her you have... questions.*
Game Master
I have a stake through the &apos;rain. The &apos;rain. The thing I think with. Thinking &apos;loody well hurts. Wanna know what I think?
*Ask why she&apos;s here alone.*
&lt;i&gt;Missing?&lt;/i&gt; Are you quite certain...?
*A lizard, tall and beautiful, turns towards you. He fixes you with a sultry look, and when he speaks it&apos;s like listening to honeyed gravel.*

Scalemail Drop
There! Now. For the moment, you&apos;ll need to back off. No pay, no stay.
Please shut up.
I thought as much.
*Say you&apos;re interested in someone with a little muscle. Ask if she has any martial experience.*
*The vision fades as the soul thrashes, trying to sever your connection.*
A fan, madam! No - it isn&apos;t that I &lt;i&gt;enjoy &lt;/i&gt;your work. I live my own with the singular hope of producing &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;like that which you have done!
Pathetic? Yes, that sounds about right.

*Ask him what he&apos;ll do now.*
Please - excuse us.

I won&apos;t lie, it still angers me that you sided with bullies against that elf.

We made it to the Arena of the One. Who shall be the next Divine?
A word of warning to you, Fane, my mysterious friend, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;

Such slaughter... this is terrible!
I&apos;ll find out, girlie girl. Trust me.
So let&apos;s just leave it on, shall we? Because to answer your question, what this collar does is this: it makes you unable to cast Source.
In vain.
*He tugs the collar of his uniform and chuckles.*

*State that there is no greater purpose than to banish life&apos;s tumult in the pursuit of pleasure.*
*Shake your head and say that he has lost his way.*
I wonder who that was.
*Curl your lip. If he could be so easily subdued, he is no god of yours.*
You look like you&apos;ve been through quite a tussle... all is well, I trust?

*Tell it to stop talking. You&apos;re not interested in whatever it has to say.*
How strong a dose can a Godwoken handle? How long &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; it take for one to succumb? So many questions!

Well, I&apos;ve certainly played more fun games of hide-and-seek.
*Ask him about the Advocate. He doesn&apos;t seem to like this creature very much.*
*Focus. Focus. Focus. This is your mind. &lt;i&gt;Yours.*&lt;/i&gt;

Unnamed Poem, by Cranley Huwbert
Don&apos;t you know, my little pepper pot, that it&apos;s ever such bad manners to enter a queen&apos;s boudoir without permission. But... what&apos;s &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt; Something familiar beats within your heart. A venom promise, a gift from one of my kind.

Beryl Griff was pleased to hear that Sister Schori and the others had left.
I&apos;ve done all I can. Their wounds are too great. All I can offer them now is prayer and a cup of water.
The Doctor is vanquished, and I am at peace. Farewell.
*With a single stab, both brutal and exact, you drive your needle into Stingtail&apos;s heart.*
It&apos;s true that you sag like an arthritic vulture. If you hope to ascend as the One, you must prove yourself a worthy host.

*Drop the topic and ask something else.*
*They skip away, still children but now... somehow... older than before.*
...the stew...? You&apos;re saying we&apos;ve been eating the missing Magist -
My days of chasing after does is long past me, of course. A shady grove and the occasional root vegetable is more than enough to keep me happy now.
Of course, madam, of course - you mustn&apos;t allow me to detain you! But do know this: Mine is not the only life you&apos;ve touched. I do so hope you&apos;ll return to the stage soon.

For shame, Scion. Saheila says you betray us. I spit on you. I spit on your name.
[BARBARIAN] *Spread a toothy grin and growl. You are as hungry for battle as the beast is for flesh.*
As for myself, I&apos;m counting on a second chance as well.

Hmm. Interesting, I&apos;ll give it that.
Quit sneaking about, will you?
*She scoffs.*
*Remark that she is no more a god than you are. You were the same, once.*
You seem in an awful hurry to leave... an &lt;i&gt;awful hurry&lt;/i&gt;... you know what that makes you seem like to me...? A SPY!

Bell-who...? Oh, yes - &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. Well, she died a Magister&apos;s death at least. I&apos;ll be sure to honour her sacrifice in my report...
If she is not here before the setting sun, I fear Magister Atusa forgets us...
