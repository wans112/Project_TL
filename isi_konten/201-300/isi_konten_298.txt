You killed him! The villain&apos;s dead. He is gone along with his name. All gone... All gone...
There will be a reckoning, Sebille. Killing gives you too much comfort. You&apos;ll be your own needle. You&apos;ll see.
Danrun
Ever the joker, that man. We design a vault of brilliant cunning and he hides our soul jars in it. As for us? We get a tower with gargoyles, tough walls, and a tougher lock.
The Black Ring will kill us on sight. We must avoid or fight them.
*Nod sagely and take your leave.*
Well then! Let&apos;s hie us onward. Suddenly there&apos;s an especially tasty carrot at the end of my stick.
So, underneath the tavern in Driftwood there&apos;s a place I feel right at home: a delightful little hive of scum and villainy. Few months back, I was relaxing down there after a job. Just a hint of drudanae, you know, a &lt;i&gt;hint&lt;/i&gt;.
A demon-hunter. One of your party is under the influence of a rather nefarious guest. I&apos;ve pledged to help her.
*Turn towards her. You&apos;re here to fight &lt;i&gt;her.*&lt;/i&gt;
I may be bound to that lamp, but I can still strike you down with a thought. Other fools will find my prison - I will have my freedom some day.
True Brew: Augmentor
Easy now. Whyn&apos;t you move along, get some fresh air?
Well, most certainly. I brought my own share of knowledge with me from the get-go. No sense in keeping it all to myself.
Whatever Lohar might have told you is neither here nor there. Now then. We adhere to a certain decorum in this court. I am sure you understand, my prince.
Burial Note From Ryker To Chaucer
Well, someone will have to clean up the mess in that cave. Bury the dead; get rid of anything the Magisters might use to pin anything on us.
Yarn
*Roost turns his face to you - and roughly wrenches the elf&apos;s jaw toward you as well.*
*A mischievous glint appears in the dark of his eye as he turns his back to you.*
Malady told me that my demon lives in Arx. I should be wary.
Weresheep
The Doctor appeared. We refused to honour the pact. There were... consequences.
Crafter&apos;s Kit
Hey there, chief.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 8: The Rise of Alexandar
Sweet Seven, now I know why they call you the all-conqueror.
Dunno if &apos;pleasure&apos;&apos;s the right word. He don&apos;t take too kindly to your kind. Make yourself useful to him, and he may change his tune.
I seem good, don&apos;t I? Yeah, I do.
You&apos;re under arrest for assault! Off to a cell with you.
Linder Kemm&apos;s Room Key
Too late, you mouldering blight-stained pigs. Grant me power, my ally! &lt;b&gt;GOD KING, I CALL ON YOU! &lt;/b&gt;
*Ask him what sort of power this is.*
*Note his ruined red clothing and say that he doesn&apos;t look much like a Magister.*
*That&apos;s quite enough. Drain her of her Source. That&apos;ll teach her to mouth off to a Godwoken.*
Wind Generic 02
The Red Prince was waylaid by a paid assassin! But who sent him?
A whetstone! Quite useful for a war-weary blade.
*Tell him he&apos;s in for the time of his life.*
I&apos;ll tell you what, though: the House of Shadows will have to do a lot better if it seeks to get the better of &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
Labrador
*You lie back on riverbank&apos;s edge, eyes closed, waiting for the fish to bite. This is the life. You open your eyes to take in the blue skies, but another sight awaits - a gaunt elven face, sliced by a chilling smile.*
N-no wait... Please... People need to know about this. They need to be warned.
I&apos;ll do what I do best: hold things together. Those that remain still need a chief, so I&apos;ll attend to whatever needs attending to. I have no more surprises up my sleeve; I dare say you&apos;ve had enough.
Brace!!!! Brace! Brace! Brace!
Highlight an enemy and press [IE_ControllerContextMenu]. Select &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Examine&lt;/font&gt;. Having more points in &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Loremaster&lt;/font&gt; reveals more information about your target.
The guests? They call themselves Seekers. They&apos;re brave people and friends to Sourcerers, but you&apos;ll find them a battered band here today, brought low by bloody battle.
I can say with confidence who I am now, at least. A thinker, the likes of which you&apos;ve never known, and never will!
*Tell him you want to help Gareth. He needs to know what happened.*
Hello again, child. What brings you here?
Stormforger
Are you sure you want to return to the lobby? This will end this fight for all players!
I make no claim that is not manifest. Warfare brings Arx to the brink of destruction even at its holiest of celebrations. You do not convince me that it is the superior way.
That so? Well, I certainly am glad to hear they didn&apos;t get to her yet. That camp of theirs - what&apos;s it called? Fort Joy? - seems positively barbaric!
[BEAST] *You know the ways of a captain like this. He must be &lt;i&gt;stopped&lt;/i&gt;.*
*Inform him the way to the shore is safe; you have defeated a great Voidwoken there.*
As I drowned, I heard a mysterious voice. The voice seemed to save me, but where did it come from, and why am I important to it...?
*Turn away with a grunt. You&apos;re here to work, not haggle.*
*Say she&apos;s seen enough of Saheila as far as you&apos;re concerned.*
*You are a dancer, a lover, and a jester. But then the Deathfog takes the forest and all you know is gone. The screams of your people echo in your heart. You become a warrior. You die fighting, all play forgotten.*
Birdie
*Sebille doesn&apos;t blink, but with a few quiet motions slips out of her clothes. She stands before you gloriously nude; fragile, yet absolutely at ease.*
*Draw your weapon. You won&apos;t be intimidated by some troubled bones.*
Formation
Hmph. Amadia&apos;s champion, are you? I&apos;ll give you what you need to find the Well of Ascension, but I need a small favour in return.
*Ask her how she knows no spirit remains of the White Magister.*
*The Red Prince takes on a reserved air, and you&apos;ve the feeling he&apos;d blush if such a thing could be noticed.*
Save your spirit to fight the reaper!
Bind yourself to target character, copying any healing or Armour restoration you receive to them. Clears Frozen, Stunned, Knocked Down, and Petrified from target character.
I will lead you to the lake, my child, but not yet. Not until you have remastered the Source and once again speak the language of creation.
Bad dwarven thieves! Thief! Mother, there&apos;s a thief!
Birds Clear Forest 05
Brass Ring
Flanged Mace
*Lie and claim not to remember.*
She made it - she made it past the flames!
I&apos;m a member of Her Majesty Queen Justinia&apos;s royal regiment. Special Officer, Rank One. Ma&apos;am!
Terror Aura
*The flower&apos;s beauty is betrayed by your memories of its sharp touch.*
&apos;Tension&apos;? How quaint.
*Even if he regrets it now.*
*Very well. Beckon Sebille. She&apos;s wanted.*
You expect me to believe that? Your Seeker friend won&apos;t escape these ruins, and neither will you!
*He squints at you for what seems like an agonisingly long time. The total silence doesn&apos;t help.*
Easy for you to say, mister! You&apos;re not smelling what I&apos;m smelling!
It&apos;s so... &lt;i&gt;lonely&lt;/i&gt;.
*The rooster looks his son over, first with one beady eye, then the other.*
*Smile. They &lt;i&gt;remembered &lt;/i&gt;you.*
Grebb does not need any help with his studies of the Void-tainted fish at present.
High Tier Blank Polymorph Skillbook
*Tell him Karon the Mistake is dead.*
You can&apos;t see it &apos;cause it&apos;s under a carpet thingy that&apos;s nice to sleep on, but a bit of the floor comes up and you go down some steps. You&apos;ll smell it when you get there!
&lt;i&gt;You are wrong.&lt;/i&gt; The verse will reach his ears. It&apos;ll drift to the realm of demons, to the Hall of Echoes, to the Void itself. Wherever he roams... &lt;i&gt;he will hear.&lt;/i&gt;
*Consume her Source.*
We sit here, our best bits rotting to nothing, while she sups on Source with Braccus and jousts with him in bed? There&apos;s no justice in the world...
The exorcised arch-demon laid waste to the island. Doctor Daeva&apos;s fate is unknown.
*Nod in empathy and ask what&apos;s next for him.*
*Whimper*
There must have been lower standards to be classed as a hero in times past...
You know you really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;the worst sometimes.
Spirit of Zimski
[SEBILLE] *Tell him your purpose: to kill for justice... and a fair bit of pleasure.*
He ruled all of this once... he was obsessed with Source, and wanted to unlock all of its powers for himself. Many suffered because of his desires... to my shame, I helped him...
Shouldn&apos;t be too hard, trust me. May require some needlework though.
*Ask her if she&apos;s alright now. You thought you were about to lose her.*
*Ask if they can read your fortune.*
*The child whimpers, poking at a maternal instinct you&apos;re sure you didn&apos;t have.*
We must bring Roost&apos;s dead flesh to the elves.
I&apos;m exiled, hunted, and plagued by ever-stranger dreams. Someone seems to be reaching out to me in my sleep... I should find a lizard dreamer to explain these visions.
Don&apos;t touch me!
*Keep things vague. You&apos;ve seen many a battle in recent days, but few survivors.*
*The toyseller nods and smiles, clearly not listening to a word you&apos;ve said.*
You can&apos;t channel enough Source? Gods be damned, why couldn&apos;t you have a nice, simple problem? Finding an orc to dance the hornpipe, perhaps?
But that doesn&apos;t matter, Lohse.&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;saw something special in you. Something they didn&apos;t see. That&apos;s enough.
Skeletal Flameweaver
But fine, keep your bloody rotting limb. I hope the flies make excellent company.
I think I shall call it the... face... ripper.
What? No - no, get back! No!
His friend&apos;s sword couldn&apos;t save him, it would appear.
Listen. I need to have a &lt;i&gt;chat&lt;/i&gt; with this here morsel of flesh. He has wronged me once, but may just do right by me this time.
Arrow Shaft
*Taunt him.*
*Shrug. She could attack - and destroy the armour in the process.*
Looks like the Silver Claw failed. Finally.
I&apos;m afraid I rather like it where it is.
All she needed from you was a dollop of prophecy juice. I dare say she got it.
*Words fail her, so instead she throws her arms around you in a big hug.*
I&apos;m guttin&apos; fish - what else?
[UNDEAD] *Respond with a cryptic smile. You know as little of death as you do of life.*
*Guess the fish aren&apos;t biting.*
*He brightens and reaches for you.*
A new life awaits! And if you&apos;re a particularly good boy, perhaps a cure as well. An end to Source - for good!
But I am fortunate.
Sheep Talk
I beg your pardon, but I really must search your bags. My belongings are missing!
It has a nice rhythm to it, doesn&apos;t it? Kind of like a song... beautiful language.
I am getting ahead of myself. You&apos;ve shown me kindness in the face of my sins. My worship is the least I can offer.
Here&apos;s one I heard lately: A group of strangers landed on the beaches outside town. Meistr Siva&apos;s people.
*You feel rage surge within you, barely containable. Feel it electrifying the blood in your veins, pumping through you. You feel like... &lt;i&gt;yourself.*&lt;/i&gt;
Gutwrencher
*Admit that you&apos;ve no idea what he&apos;s talking about.*
Speak to Tovah if speak you must, you forget you are an elf and I speak no more with you.
*Pat him on the shoulder and lightly push him away from you. Dust off his shoulders and tell him he&apos;ll be alright.*
Malqg the Stalker
*He freezes and shoots you a wary glance, looking for all the world like a wild animal caught in the lantern-light of a racing carriage.*
