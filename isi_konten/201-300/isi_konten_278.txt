Of course! Do you still not see? You are more than what you once were. More than what our people ever were. Do you still not realise there will never be abatement?
I don&apos;t care, I don&apos;t care! Please, just leave me be.
Damage On Move
No Laughing Matter
Alexandar you&apos;ve been bished! Lie down!
You still wanderin&apos; around? Easy, lad - they&apos;ll get your scent! You can hide here - there&apos;s room for ya!
Blood Cocoon
But I guess there&apos;s no use crying about it now. What&apos;s done is done. And we still need to move forward.
There could still be information to uncover. And if I&apos;m to get back in Kemm&apos;s good graces, I need to be the one to find it.
Door to the Dwarven Temple
Oh hi again.
Most certainly.
*Ask him what he&apos;s planning.*
Rock
And besides, he had some business that coincided with Dallis&apos; interests. Of course, if he were to act up, we could always work on his little &lt;i&gt;&apos;vulnerability&apos; &lt;/i&gt;to Fortify...
Hah! Good one!
*Remark that demonology is your specialty. The Paladins in there could use your expertise.*
I should see a healer. Maybe there&apos;s still time...
I am preparing my soul. In case I fall...
Um... what did that do?
I hold your marrow. No take-backs and no returns, and defaulters all... suffer. Thank you for your custom, please come again.
Take a step back.
&lt;b&gt;7 Aventuris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve learned of the perfect scent to complete my collection. The rarest bouquet of all: death itself, spiced with filth and tinged with sadness. The name of such a treasure? Attar of the Blood Rose. The petals of three blood roses when crushed will yield this most intoxicating perfume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;23 Junar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have found the location where the blood roses grow, deep underground on the island of Braccus Rex, from the bones of his tortured dead. I will journey there to find the blossoms. Oh sweet nectar, how I long to smell it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 Germinet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have arrived in the caverns and not sighted a single rose, yet one sniff of the air assures me that they are close. I must delve deeper...
Easy for you to say, standing there with your head on your neck like a queen.
*Just as the spirit fades away, a final phrase escapes her lips.*
[1] unlocked [2]
Really? Neat.
Shush, Fedor. You, stranger. Go to Reimond at the docks. He&apos;ll want to know of the news you bring. And hurry - he sails soon.
Well. I&apos;ll just have to take your word for it!
*Windego says nothing, but her unspoken words envelop you. &lt;i&gt;&apos;No more games. Only liberty.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Free of her cage, Windego intends to break into Linder Kemm&apos;s vault in search of the Swornbreaker and freedom from the God King.
You&apos;re here.
Driftwood - Dunes
Don&apos;t make this hard. It&apos;s a two-way street you know.
You have what you want, don&apos;t you? Get gone.
*Turn and walk away.*
A new species of Void-tainted fish found recently along the shores of Reaper&apos;s Coast. Noted for its malevolent intelligence, as far as fish are concerned.
Dead Black Ring Defiler
Yep.
*Beneath your fingertips, you feel the third tumbler shudder into place within the mechanism. Your breathing slows. Your mind goes blank. Nothing remains but you and this lock.*
I go - my armour finds its spore-mates.
Run. Run away, Beast. Run from Arx, run from the coast. Just run. Run from the Deathfog...
*Say you pose no threat to her whatsoever.*
*Tattoo a line across the name of Roost.*
*The air surrounding the totem seems to hum - it remains awake.*
*She looks up at you, a look of slight disbelief on her face, then lowers her head again. You feel a little damp spot on your chest where a single tear has fallen.*
*Your body convulses with Amadia&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile grows at the sight of your agony.*
I feel the pull of the Hall... it&apos;s my time at last. Gods, I hope I&apos;ll meet my boy again. Maybe I&apos;ll get to look him in the eye when I take his head from him again, and again, and again.
Alas, we&apos;ve seen them tumble from their tower...
*Ask what Lone Wolves are doing out here in the cloaca of nowhere.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve heard enough, and draw your weapon.*
If you want a dedicated crew, then you make their problems &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;problems. Justinia&apos;s got the rebellion in her sights. My comrades. My friends. I got their backs - &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; yours. Only right you got theirs, too.
I was left with the oh-so-important task of guarding an empty vault.
Did they show mercy or strength? Did they sacrifice others as Lucian had done? Did they regret becoming Divine? Did they wonder if they should have given their soul and sealed the Veil?
Hush now. Set your quivering bones and we&apos;ll not fail.
A luminous fungus that thrives anywhere it can bask in the silvery light of the moon.
Self-Made Shirt
*Ask him who he is.*
*Say you&apos;re pretty comfortable here. Sun, sea and sand: this is the good life.*
Mantle of the Pilgrim
My husband&apos;s grown weaker each year. The hope that Lucian will return has kept him going, but now he can barely stand.
A grimy old key. Now to find what it can unlock...
*She offers you a grateful smile.*

Exploration Theme 07 Dark A
Forged by the Dwarf Queen&apos;s personal weaponmaster in the eye of the storm, this mace will shock all who are touched by it. And worse.
[MYSTIC] *An undead creature... lich, perhaps? You try to recall the chant that forces one to reveal its true name...*
A round, well-ornamented lizard shield that bears the distinctive markings of the House of War.
Desperate times, desperate measures and all that.
*He draws his weapon, ready for the final confrontation between the Red and the Shadow Prince.*
Poisoned Cup of Milk
*The lizard lets out a low, rumbling hiss.*
I extinguished them in an instant. Like they were &lt;i&gt;nothing...&lt;/i&gt;
Prison Grate
Slumberjack gave away the location of the loot.
It is time. The Elves need a new Mother. They need you. Take root, Sebille. The Mother demands it of you.
Spirit of an Elderly Mage
I&apos;ll need evidence you found the bugger before I listen to a whole yarn.
You could just say so, y&apos;don&apos;t need to show me yerrrr hands, like I see them and go, &apos;Oh, yerrr right! No drudanae therrre!&apos;
Hunt those who hunt the Red Prince.
I just need to plead his case. To Dallis herself, if I&apos;m able. Or to whoever&apos;s in charge now.
Sebille wants Divinity. I will stand at her side at the Well of Ascension.
At it keeping, gnomans!
Get you something, friend?
Mortar And Pestle
That&apos;ll be Aurnia; she has the skills you need - and then some.
Keep the Boss Happy
What are you... No! Please! My boy! My boy needs me! Barin!
Shooting arrows will inflict bonus elemental damage depending on the surface your target is standing in.
[FANE] *Intriguing. Move towards the chest, if only to examine it more closely.*
*The heat recedes. The screams die beneath the dull roar of the flames. Syrus Oates grits his teeth. He does not scream.*
Of course, of course! Anything- just name it.
Ah, Alexandar. Just in case we forget who holds us captive...
*Shrug. Sure.*
Debuff All Potion
*Uneasily agree. What should you expect?*
Go away, go away, go away, go AWAY!
Finding the cellar door ajar, instead of trying to escape you snuck into the pantry like a common thief, only to find nothing but rather questionable turnips.
*White as Driftwood salt, the dwarf flinches at your approach yet she holds a short, clean blade aloft. Her fierce stance can&apos;t hide the trembling of her fingers.*
You who succours the souls of the dead: I thank you!
*Tell her &apos;interesting&apos; is a nice euphemism for &apos;violent&apos;.*
I clean the chaff away. I clean you out, Beast. I empty you.
*The Red Prince stands stunned when he sees the woman you were about to address.*
Oh, I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; sorry. Who are you again? Oh, right: Someone who needs to mind her own business.
You... you&apos;re an elf, aren&apos;t you? You&apos;re not straw?
*A mix of sweat and blood smears across Gareth&apos;s forehead. He looks to the house, then back to the graves.*
Attack 5 times with astonishing speed, each hit dealing [1] damage.
*Gareth stumbles backwards. His words pierce you like daggers.*
Really.
*The egg nestles in the glowing fire, where it must stay until it hatches. It cannot be allowed to grow cold.*
Paladin Priest
Alone? As you wish. I will now teleport you into the Arena.
*Grab a nearby cup and throw some water in his face.*
*Tell him you&apos;ll consider it.*
Ahaaaaaaa, you&apos;re back! Oh it&apos;s so good to see ya, mate. You look... you know who you look like? The moon. I bet you hear that all the time, don&apos;t ya.
*Maybe it&apos;s lust.*
Black Ring forces on the island were led by a twisted elven creature known only as the Sallow Man. He died in battle.
Of course there are some that struggle with accepting the honour that is serving the exalted House of War, hence the scars.
Ain&apos;t nobody needin&apos; your approval. You gonna tell me you don&apos;t like the idea of becoming a god?
*Remark that many aboard this ship died during recent ordeals - how is it that he survived?*
[BEAST] *Lean in and growl that you don&apos;t care what he asks -- you want an answer.*
*The warg snarls and growls at her comrades.*
I would n-n-n-never! My whole l-l-life was for Lucian, every action a p-p-prayer to him...
*Growl.* You! Sourcerer. Go! Emmie - crying! *Bark!*
Emanating arcane energy, this mask makes the wearer appear to be a dwarf.
Essential Engineering&lt;br&gt;By Barty Crumb&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curious about automatons? Unsure how to get the most out of these mechanical wonders? Then read on for Barty’s tips, tricks, and tutelage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step one: MAKE IT RUN! How? Why, with a phase capacitor, of course. More about those in Chapter Five. Suffice to say, an automaton cannot function without one. In the unlikely event an automaton should malfunction, rip the capacitor out before it can do any significant damage!
*Suddenly, Malady&apos;s face drains of all colour. She gasps, as though stricken by a terrible pain.*
The Divine sips from a lake of Source, but they sip all the same. And to seal this world off from the Voidwoken will take &lt;i&gt;every &lt;/i&gt;drop of that power.
Imp
*A playful smile of love and hate plays upon her lips as her heart beats slowly on.*
By Lucian&apos;s love, can&apos;t you leave me be? I&apos;ve lost enough today...
Magical Warbow
Two Magisters will die for every fallen Seeker here, if I have any say in the matter...
Raider Brute
[JESTER] *Tell the gem the answer is right in front of your face, then cross your eyes.*
Now, I may be able to steel you a little more, in preparation for the trials to come.
*Isbeil&apos;s hot stare burns into your soul. You meet her gaze with one of your own, though you know you could never match her intensity.*
*Tell her you&apos;d be happy to pay.*
*She suddenly snaps straight, trembling and rigid. A voice booms from the helm - not hers.*&lt;br&gt;
So? What do you want?
Eithne is... &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; my name.
Fear
You please me, child. Your loyalty will be remembered.
