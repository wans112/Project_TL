I suppose you heard of the disappearances around here, have you? Well the case has been solved, thanks to a Magister... or rather an &lt;i&gt;ex&lt;/i&gt;-Magister...
As for me... I was freed of the tyranny of the God King. To atone for my sins in this world I spent the rest of my days taking care of the sick and elderly. I would tell the story of the Godwoken to anyone who would listen. The story of the greatest heroes Rivellon had ever known. The heroes who chose not to close the Veil.

Oh you poor fool. What lies did they tell you? Did they promise that you were special? That they would treat you as anything other than a slave?
