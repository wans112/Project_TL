Frankly, I would not trust you with yesterday&apos;s lunch, never mind Divinity.

Yeah, can you? Can you make it? Huh?

So the House of Shadows thinks Sadha threat: their Shadow Prince wants me to kill her because she may become the mother of dragons.
There&apos;s nothing left I can do for you, Lohse. Nothing but feel sorry for you. And that I certainly do. For here, in this house, no harm may come to me.
*Sigh.* You &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;should not have done that. Now you leave me no choice...
*Ask the elf what he means.*
*...and as your body fills with the humming power of her stolen Source, with a wave of angered anguish he fades away to the Hall of Echoes, forever to be alone.*
*Suggest a deal: he lets you walk, and you won&apos;t tell anyone what you witnessed here.*
Ah, you want reunion. Life is lonesome, yes. Life is lonesome; the thing you love is gone. I have something for you, my friend. A gift.
*MORE.*
*Reflected in the mirror of his eyes, you see yourself: majestic, powerful, emanating an aura of purest Source. Ifan reaches out a hand and traces your jawline with the lightest touch.*
*Tell her you&apos;re looking for a way out; your heart has nothing to do with it.*
*Her eyes clear and she turns her head to the heavens once more.*
Oh, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. A trivial detail. An old agreement, long forgotten by all involved. Don&apos;t give it a second thought.
If you wish to be the one to claim that regal glory... I suggest you &lt;i&gt;hurry up&lt;/i&gt;.
*The Magister&apos;s hatred spills over and he opens his mouth as if to scream - in fear and frustration and pure, naked rage - *
Quisvilius the Malevolent
Chest of a Lizard Hero
You have forgotten so much of what you once were. You must start to remember. And then...
Alas, harmony was not to last. The Demon Divine desired ever more power. The demon wars began. Rivellon was ravaged.
*Shrug and respond that of course she&apos;s dead. She&apos;s &lt;i&gt;translucent.*&lt;/i&gt;
Let me ask you this: across the world, who is renowned above all others for their exquisite lovemaking abilities?

You&apos;re a terrible liar, you know. If you&apos;re trying to protect me, to protect the kingdom: don&apos;t. I must send word. Quickly.

Obey me!
Now is the moment for our people - our great people - to map out our destiny.
Cursed to pray for eternity. But for now, the Gods aren&apos;t listening.
*The tablet seems to glow from within with a subtle light. Etched runes cover its surface. The markings &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; familiar, but you have no idea what they mean.*
Fine, then. But I&apos;m keeping my eye on you.
I blame myself; I should never have encouraged him as a child. He could have grown up to be a merchant, or a dentist... not embarassing himself like this.

Listen here: we&apos;ll not kill Lohar on behalf of that Magister! I won&apos;t be a party to it!
A refugee from the Joy, then. Impressive. Few avoid the Magisters&apos; watchful eyes. Can this Godwoken declare other triumphs, Isbeil?
He came to me broke. I treated him for his lack of talent. The treatment was successful, I hope you&apos;ll agree. And then... he wrote a poem about me. It wasn&apos;t complimentary.
&apos;death awayts beyonde this poynte&apos;
This cannot continue. The Devourer seeks to ascend by claiming a champion who will feast on the ones bound to this set.

I smell cabbages! There&apos;s Source around here!

I&apos;ve had enough of your deceit. Prepare to die!
After all this time, after all these troubles, we will finally be together, Sadha.
I am looking for a man called The Doctor. Do you know where I might find him?

*Tell him that whatever service you rendered him was purely accidental. It isn&apos;t always about him.*

Come... let us be done with this farce...
Well, you&apos;ve got this wolf on a leash now.
*It &lt;i&gt;rises.*&lt;/i&gt;
[UNDEAD] *Crack your bare knuckles. She seems fearful; has she noticed something... untoward?*
Blood Spit
Someone paid me to. Nothing more to it than that.
You sure about that?
You gonna scratch my back or what?
*Gareth&apos;s nostalgia lasts for just a moment longer. He composes himself, clears his throat, and waits for your next question.*

Teleport things! Relocate enemies into harmful surfaces, place explosive barrels closer to your foes, or move allies out of harm&apos;s way.
Beggars can&apos;t be choosers. Atusa extends her hand. I take it, even if it&apos;s but straw I grasp for.
My! I was all but certain you were worming your way through a bug&apos;s bowels by now. Glad to be mistaken of course. Let&apos;s find the others.
Fane...

I&apos;m writing about Amadia, the mother of all magic. Truly fascinating.
*Lucian&apos;s gaze rests upon you - and goes through you. He takes your measure &lt;i&gt;entirely.*&lt;/i&gt;
Ha.
*Say you are fairly uncomfortable with the game&apos;s elements and aren&apos;t sure you understand them.*
Well, I&apos;m hardly the person to ask for advice about romance. The last person I loved turned out to be a polymorphed wollock. But the way I see it, the best way to get the love you want is to become someone worthy of that love.
Something so peculiar is probably particularly dangerous.
*Choose the rebel tune.*

Skills get penalties or bonuses based on your primary stats.
Ah, fellow noble. Such a dignified carriage could belong to no other! It&apos;s a delight to greet someone of my own station. Not that I would judge these present plebians; they are here by invitation, of course!
Between you and me... he&apos;s really not. He&apos;d just be a liability to you.
*Assure him that you&apos;re a simple creature. You want gold: a percentage of the will.*
Hold it, now! Papa no know? You... ah, it&apos;s the Beastman! Go on in! And if&apos;n ya see Dorotya, give her a wink for me. *Wink*

Voice Overhead
*With each in-breath, the voices flutter in. Whispers, at first, then gentle murmurs like water over rocks.*
There must be a way across.
Bring the Voidling chick to its father.
Ha! It&apos;s working; keep it up!
Preset
What do you make of it?
*Say they&apos;ve been absolutely useless.*
Nobody&apos;s pure in this world. You do what you have to do.
You are a fine specimen. Most fi-*ksssrrrk*-ne. Your arrival is long overdue.
*Tell her you&apos;re eager to learn.*
Mmmmm... There&apos;s some discolouration, but I&apos;ve seen worse. After all, one can&apos;t expect to find prime merchandise on a squalid little ship like this.
So what? You gonna neutralise the threat? Shuck off the liability?
Shall we sail?
*Bow your head and say it&apos;s been an honour travelling with him.*
I took no pleasure in it, but when Dallis wants it done, it gets done. If not by my hand, then another&apos;s.
The hunt. &lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; hunt. As for the reason: you&apos;re staring at it.
*Stay where you are.*
No harm done, I suppose! Though why I pay good money for these so-called bodyguards is another question entirely.
I tried to leave. I heard of a shelter in the Hollow Marshes, a place where Sourcerers could go...

*With a tremendous surge all power leaves you. You weaken in body and spirit. The silent darkness draws near...*
Most certainly. In this one and the others in my tent. They will soon hatch my children: the offspring of the Red Prince and I, the Red Princess.
Times are tough. We pay more fer less.

Death Wish Skillbook
It is as you say. The God King... he&apos;s a powerful drug, and the Black Ring is no more than a band of junkies. But there is a way to shatter the Covenant. A Swornbreaker scythe.
*The turtle&apos;s eyes dart about in a rather non-turtle-like way.*
*There&apos;s no doubt in your mind: as a hero, and a king.*

I am so, so lucky to be here with you, and yet...

You&apos;d pick up anything, wouldn&apos;t you?
Long Branch
After all, it&apos;s not every day one gets a glimpse into the past.
*Say that clearly she meant a very great deal to her people. Didn&apos;t they mean a great deal to her?*
But... she was in no hurry to call in her favour.
When a slave strikes a Master, the slave dies! You are a demon slave. You die!
