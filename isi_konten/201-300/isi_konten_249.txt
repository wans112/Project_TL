*Wonder if he&apos;d be willing to recite you a piece.*
*Slobber drips from the dog&apos;s bared fangs. Where the driblets land, the soil bubbles.*
You aren&apos;t sure? How do I know it won&apos;t w-w-worsen the torment?! How do I know you know anything at all?!
What&apos;s happening? I- I don&apos;t feel well. I- wait, what are you doing?
*Give him a blank stare, pretending you don&apos;t understand him.*
Quivering Dwarf
*Sadha is in the city of Arx. You know where to go if you seek to find her.*
*She flinches in fear, and begins to stammer an answer to you.*
*You are Lennard Rawl. You&apos;re a Godwoken and a thief. You keep your secrets well - even from yourself.*
Very well, the master of the Voidwoken is a creature older than any demon. My master will never speak his true name, but the Black Ring know him as the God King of-
You gonna waste my time, we&apos;re gonna have trouble. Go on. Out with it.
Or, my dear Beast, shall I cut straight to the cure? You and I, we have a common enemy.
*Tell him he should be more careful.*
Hmm? What? Oh. New, are you? Very good, very good, make yourself at home.
Oh, but you&apos;re a clever one, aren&apos;t you, Ifan? Fine - I&apos;m tired of pretending I serve this weak wench, anyway. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
Ah, sure. Maybe I&apos;ll see you around then. It was... really nice meeting you.
The God King spoke. I was to fulfill the Covenant and kill all who stood in his way: Lucian, Dallis, Braccus... everyone.
Mending
*Not for long. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*She ekes out another thin smile.*
*She talks for some time, about birthdays, about Felix&apos;s prickly beard, about the skunk Stefan once dragged home for a pet.*
Takes one to know one. Just don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
[RED PRINCE] *Refuse the call. What can Gareth know of your destiny?*
[BARBARIAN] *Grab her by the hand and press it. Hard.*
Source Hound Liszt
You there! If you see Lord Arhu, inform us at once! He seems to have gone missing. He&apos;s tall, dark-skinned, white-haired. Occasionally takes, erh... the form of a cat.
*Relent. If the future of all elves is truly at stake, that is worth a great sacrifice.*
Yit Vorr
*Ask what happened.*
*She nods her thanks to you before turning and following a path into the unknown.*
And if anyone goes near my mum I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll.. I&apos;ll bite its head off! Thank you, mister! You&apos;re a good person!
*Say you know the feeling. It&apos;s all been so surreal.*
We beat the Shriekers.
I found a dreamer, but before I could speak with him he was killed. Just my luck.
Ha! Of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt;, precious. But which is worse, the cure or the disease?
It&apos;s a shame that poor girl couldn&apos;t be saved... but at least I&apos;ve learned what happened to her.
We kept the ring for ourselves.
My, my, you still have the needle I gave you! How very gratifying. A fine instrument, is it not? Precise. Exact.
A vile-scented draught capable of draining your constitution.
Red Prince, Spouse of the Sun, &lt;i&gt;Anan Erchet!&lt;/i&gt; I - your servant, Brahmos - I was keeping the portal at the consulate open for you, but, but...
What I wouldn&apos;t give to get that back.
But never mind. Smash that mirror to bits for all I care. I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; find her, with or without you.
The Advocate offered to increase our mastery of Source... by taking it from some tormented soul, locked in a distant dungeon. Nevertheless, we accepted.
Reset All
*The statue appears to almost hover above the blood and filth of this place, yet her feet are stained red. Although her eyes are bound against the destitution around her, her expression is mournful, grieving even.*
*Remark on her anger. There&apos;s something behind it - but what, exactly?*
*He raises an eyebrow and wryly grins...*
The Hammer could not strike me down, but this place... this place... May the Seven protect us all.
1 point would add +[1]% Vitality.
You&lt;i&gt; remember!&lt;/i&gt; My blind eyes make you see!
Be wary if you should, for there are others in this world. &apos;Godwoken.&apos; The mortal champions chosen by the others.
Low Ground! [1]% Damage
*Solid ground materialises beneath your feet. Your weight falls back into your body all at once and bright sunlight stings your eyes.*
I&apos;m waiting to meet a brave, beautiful, highly skilled adventurer.
Omelet
The gods are weak. Weaker than I expected. The Void is nearly here. You need to go the Well of Ascension and absorb the Source of the Seven. &lt;i&gt;All &lt;/i&gt;of it.
Aid me!
I think ya might have a bit of brain leakin&apos; out yer ears. Ain&apos;t no-one here like that. Get yer act together, boy!
*Gareth stands at attention. His square jaw tightens, and he takes in a haughty breath.*
Leave me alone, okay?
*Say you&apos;d like your nearby party members to join you. They are at your command.*
You&apos;re stupid. And smelly.
We were &apos;aze-&apos;uilders, see. We constructed la&apos;yrinths! &apos;raccus hi&apos;self said the one with the gargoyles was the &apos;est &apos;aze ever. Right &apos;fore he cut off our heads.
Until we meet again, Sebille.
You doin&apos; okay, boy of mine?
Statue of the Divine
Acid Spores
Laced Scale Gloves
*She looks up.*
Aha!
*The servant emits a menacing growl.*
Sometimes, yer best leavin&apos; the past where it is. I&apos;d rather focus on sweet songs over battle chants. But if you want to make music &apos;stead of war, I&apos;ll be around.
A sturdy, slightly sticky key smelling faintly of dog&apos;s breath
Mordus! Mordus takes all! Noooooooooooooo!
*The canvas sails above you slap angrily against the topmast.*
Chamore Doran
Oh, Master Fane. You were always kind.
One must put in due effort if one is to reap the proper reward.
If you think you can fool me, you are even more of an idiot than I imagined. You are a scared child, but you cannot hide from what you have done.
Look... me and mine, we moved... classified cargo. Took it right off Magister ships and put it into the hands of those that would use it rightly.
Minor Memory Potion
[1] reduces all status durations by 1 turn, including positive statuses. Does not affect statuses with a duration of 1 turn.
*The creature tries to speak at the sight of you. One of the stitches binding its lips snaps open. It winces in pain and fingers the wound.*
[IFAN] *Admit that once upon a time, you served with Alexandar.*
*It seems suspicious. Grab a rock and smash it.*
I felt someone&apos;s gaze on me from almost the very moment I stepped foot on the coast. Lucian taught never to ignore augury, and sure enough - I saw the flash of white, I heard the sprigs snapping. Someone was watching. Following.
&lt;i&gt;I know.&lt;/i&gt;
*He blanks you.*
Still, there&apos;s something about you. I see guilt in your eyes. Can you prove your innocence?
...the conjurer over there was dispatched to us, to help flood the temple with seawater instead. I won&apos;t fail the next time though, I s-swear.
Most fleshy folks aren&apos;t really alive, anyway. Don&apos;t sweat it. Or... whatever it is you do.
I want to visit Lucian&apos;s shrine. To find answers. But perhaps it is a fool&apos;s errand.
Temple of Tir-Cendelius
I&apos;m glad Lucian wasn&apos;t around to see his son murdered by Sourcerers. Those fiends are Rivellon&apos;s shame.
Character gains twisted power by sacrificing their own blood.
Dwarf Civilian
Well played.
*Say you&apos;re curious about him; can you ask him a question?*
This dagger has an inscription: &apos;When the night shadows gather, the hunter howls.&apos;
*Ask if he knows his thugs are terrorising the camp&apos;s citizens.*
*Ask what a dwarf is doing palling around with humans.*
Battle the Voidwoken.
Could have used some help back there, I&apos;ll tell you that. But all&apos;s well that ends well. Say, you were on the ship here with me, weren&apos;t you?
Then you shall rise as I descend. The future has come!
I couldn&apos;t stop them. I didn&apos;t think &lt;i&gt;anyone &lt;/i&gt;could stop them...
If it knew us, it must have been hunting us. We must tread with care.
*Muster the Source within you and commune with the spirit.*
Beast
You may thank Lord Kemm for the information, I will put it to good use. We&apos;ll get to the bottom of this, I guarantee it.
*Wonder about the &apos;he&apos;, that it referred to - who does it speak of?*
*Offer an understanding pat on the back.*
Thief!
*The Seeker has removed one of her gauntlets in order to flex her wrist. It bears inflamed marks from where shackles bit into her. She sees you.*
*The dwarf stares in shock and starts to tremble.*
*Tell him to stop staring.*
I&apos;m worth more gold than that!
*Show her the ring they gave you. Insist that you&apos;re on her side.*
*The cook piles a bundle of what appears to be red clothing into the hearth. It ignites.*
*Roll your eyes. This smells of charlatanry.*
Knight&apos;s Promise
Everything... everything is very dark all of a sudden.
How DARE you?
I thought I&apos;d seen everythin&apos; in my travels. But I ain&apos;t never seen a place like this.
I do not belong to a child. I belong to the bad place.
&apos;North - Bloodmoon Island&lt;br&gt;West - Reaper&apos;s Bluffs&lt;br&gt;South - Beach&lt;br&gt;East - Driftwood&apos;
Changed by his experience with the Godwoken, the Sourcerer Mordus proved a useful tool in the fight against the demons. The Alliance quickly learned to keep him away from ordinary soldiers, for the sake of morale.
*The monk has no response to your stick or your scream, unless you count its head&apos;s nigh-imperceptible rhythmic sway as a response.*
Exquisite! The perfect tool to rip a face from a corpse.
Now our fates shall forever be entwined.
*The brother is at peace with himself. He stood by his queen, and he stood by his sister too. His exile and ultimate death wasn&apos;t his fault. But his sister rages on - she did the right thing, she stood up for what she believed.*
I&apos;m not one for wasting time. Out with it, already.
Trumpeting Statue
Another ode to crass dwarven excess.
*Interrupt. Ask him how it came to this.*
The gargoyle gave me a skull. Uh, thanks.
I should have known you&apos;d be trouble, right from that first moment when you refused to shake my hand. A lack of character. A lack of righteousness.
That&apos;s it, I&apos;ve had enough of this shite today. You&apos;ll die for what you did, traitor, and you&apos;ll die now!
Destiny Of Souls
You take her from me. You take her from all of us. You damn our people.
*Tell Borris that Saheila died by your hand.*
We chased him to this factory, but lost him on the docks.
*Offer your support in her search for the truth about what happened here.*
Can we get on with this already?
*Tell the dog you&apos;ll investigate if you can.*
Bowl
The statues guard the path. They will grant passage to those who sing from the hymn book, from the archives.
I&apos;m - I&apos;m Buddy.
[LIZARD] *Say you&apos;re just another lizard, a long way from home. You mean her no harm.*
