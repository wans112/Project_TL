Sebille! Right? Glad to see you made it.
*Shake your head and deny your companions.*
*She looks at her father and manages a small smile.*
You think a bloody &lt;i&gt;cook &lt;/i&gt;could best the Magisters of &lt;i&gt;this garrison...?&lt;/i&gt; How? What proof do you have?!
Trust me, convenient is the last word I&apos;d use to describe the experience. Pass me that copper wire there, would you?
*Wonder what&apos;ll happen if this fugitive is caught.*
Perhaps this will offer you some small consolation...
Well now! I *Hack!* certainly hope that&apos;s the truth. Your kind&apos;ve caused enough troubles for ours, don&apos;t you think?
[Translate32_ca3030a0-6e31-4cb3-a51b-67a057deb556]
War and death were the mad Sourcerer king Braccus&apos; constant companions on his quest for power. Resist at your peril.
*Ask her what she&apos;s trying to fix.*
Track Marker
Me and some &lt;i&gt;otherrrs&lt;/i&gt; just barely made it, but then these &lt;i&gt;blood beasts&lt;/i&gt; attacked us right away. A few made it away. I &lt;i&gt;dddidn&apos;t.&lt;/i&gt;
Raining Blood Scroll
I can&apos;t say for certain, but I bet you could simply &lt;i&gt;sniff &lt;/i&gt;her out. She&apos;s got quite a nose for the fetid. Find the foulest pile of shit you can, and she&apos;ll be wallowing in the middle.
Metal Armour
Do you take me for a fool? I&apos;m afraid you are the foolish one!
C
Nothing to do with me. I have other fish to fry.
*She waxes on at length regarding her wartime exploits, describing feats no rat you&apos;ve ever seen could actually perform.*
I prefer actions to dreams, good sir. The Void cannot be turned back on the power of wishes.
Resist Death
*Tell them you&apos;ll see what you can do.*
If he still thinks he&apos;s the one that will replace daddy dearest, he&apos;s in for a surprise.
If you find my bones, see that they are burned in the lizard quarter - I&apos;ll see that you are rewarded!
*Price? Boldly state that she gave you the goods for &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt;.*
Bring it home... let me rest...
*Nod. You understand what&apos;s at stake here.*
They&apos;d &apos;ardly kick out their own flesh and blood, would they?! I barely know any of them - friends of friends of *HIC!* business acquaintances.
That tablet Ryker wants has to be close. Better be worth the trouble.
[JESTER] *Point out that being an adventurer is no laughing matter. You could really use someone to keep you cheered up.*
[VILLAIN] *Insist that heroes are overrated. Gareth would do well to explore darker paths.*
Lucky for you, I ain&apos;t lookin&apos; to pick a fight outside the arena. Ya wanna show yourself off, you do it in there.
*Insist she&apos;s as mad as a rabid were-rat. You&apos;re no servant, and she&apos;s a ghost.*
Porridge
No... no...&lt;i&gt; no!&lt;/i&gt;
Hi there. Bye then.
*shrk*
Remind me to apologise later, Mal.
*The truth hangs heavy upon the air itself, unspoken. This is the point of no return. Somewhere beyond this point you shall be undone - or you shall ascend. There is no middle ground.*
*Marvel at the beauty of the axe. Ask if that&apos;s fresh blood on the blade.*
*The captain snaps his fingers. Zapor&apos;s arm scurries to his empty shoulder.*
There is no civilisation among slavers. Only the word and the whip.
A [1] will be summoned at the location of your target(s).
Gnarled Tree
Nothing good. The Voidwoken are everywhere.
Shoes of Trembling
*Ask if he&apos;s changed his mind about Divine power, given everything that&apos;s happened.*
I do hope I&apos;ve not been overestimating your intelligence. Anathema&apos;s blade. By the weapon&apos;s own admission, it&apos;s to be found somewhere on Bloodmoon Island.
This is a gift from the gods; perhaps they still smile upon us. It must not be harmed.
Pick one up- tip back your cup, eighty-
*A child&apos;s voice inside you whispers &apos;We make our own...&apos;.*
*Note that he looks a little pale - is he unwell?*
*Ask if you could just hear more about what the rat saw unfold here.*
*Say it is. You&apos;re glad he was able to resurrect his friend.*
Whatever.
*Frown. So in her analogy, &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; rancid pork fat?*
To think she awaits me even now, no more than a walk away... Come, we must move north at once!
[SCHOLAR] *Say that you&apos;ve read about Amadia: a few snippets in a very obscure tome.*
*Say you need to speak to Micheil Ros. Lean in and whisper that Lohar sent you.*
You may spout jovialities from dawn until dusk, but I assure you that our situation is not a mirthful one.
*He grabs hold of the plank and hefts his great bulk backward. The rusted nail pops loose, and the dwarf stands back smiling proudly, his prize in his hands.*
My dear sweet prince, I&apos;ve grown to trust you. More than I&apos;ve trusted anyone since...
Flaming Amulet
I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t accommodate you with the opportunity to have a word with milord Kemm at this precise moment, milady. Milord left early in the morning in pursuit of business and he hasn&apos;t yet returned.
Please - not now. Something&apos;s wrong in the camp.
You won&apos;t believe it. (He won&apos;t believe it, Mabel. He&apos;ll think we&apos;re mad cows.)
*A note flutters out of the waterlogged bicorne the minute you pick it up.*
Fearful of his shadowy pursuers, Brahmos the Wanderer sought refuge in a Paladin camp. I hope he made it there safe.
Not a moment longer than we have to, but we&apos;re at something of an impasse. The ship won&apos;t move.
*You reach out to touch the relic.*
I expect nothing and everything. I expect rainbows to span the sky, and earthquakes to shake all of Rivellon. I expect demons to roar and sparrows to sing.
Amn&apos;t I cream then?
*You start to speak, but it&apos;s too late. Duna breaks free, and the voice that emerges from your mouth is not quite your own.*
It&apos;s easy for Hannag to write, but where in the Void am I supposed to find tenebrium tools?!
&apos;Here lies Zebedie Haran.&lt;br&gt;Would sell his granny.&lt;br&gt;But at the fairest of prices.&apos;
Oh poppet, what makes you think you&apos;re leaving?
That advisor of hers. Isbeil. She&apos;s involved. But... how?
*The spirit&apos;s face warps into an indignant scowl.*
*Duck out of his embrace and laugh.*
[RED PRINCE] *Accept. You know what pleasures await. You long to taste them again.*
*Consume his Source.*
*Admonish him. He does not always deal well with stress.*
A gentlewoman among jesters, you are. Give that lever a pull, and I guarantee we&apos;ll both get something out of the deal. &lt;br&gt;
Well, I do appreciate the tough love. After all these centuries, I&apos;m still learning new things!
No!
*The girl grimaces and thrashes her head about. The demon within utters a growl.*
You... you are our most favoured, &lt;i&gt;most delicious&lt;/i&gt; friend. Come and go as you will...
Yes, yes, I&apos;m sure you did.
Only she who claims everything will &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; everything. The Void&apos;s doom; this world&apos;s liberator.
*Say one who knows how to get other people to do what they want.*
Questions? There is no time for questions - just give me the jars!
*The shrine depicts Duna, yet has clearly seen better days. Scratches and fissures deface its exterior, and its eyes have been gouged hollow.*
Number of uses
Tenebrium Resistance
Save Meistr Siva.
*Smile and squeeze her hand before you leave.*
The Reluctant Servants
I will not harm you, never! So if you can truly imagine my torment, I swear upon my mother&apos;s long-crumbled grave, I&apos;ll help you if you free me. Freedom for freedom.
Tattoo Needle
One guess who the emergency targets were: us!
Combining several of these single face masks, along with a Source orb will produce a Mask of the Shapeshifter.
No. I&apos;ve been through too much now. I have too much skin in the game - my actual skin. I need to be sure of this. I can&apos;t risk letting this demon have me, body and soul.
Harpoon
*Ask why this God King is so worthy of all this effort.*
That ship - it&apos;s the Lord Dread!
*Try to interject. You&apos;re not sure you understand anything anymore...*
Well, I hope we catch them soon. I don&apos;t like it when people aren&apos;t nice!
Permanent Vitality Potion
Incandescent Sharpshooter
If you don&apos;t know her, it&apos;s best to keep it that way. That Thieves&apos; Guild of hers is a cutthroat bunch of young&apos;uns.
I show you where to go. There is another Ancestor Tree, rudely torn down, sadly fallen. But if you cross the trunk, you pass this place of sorrows... to the other side.
*Tell him you have no interest in Divinity. You have business in the mundane realm.*
So? Heard any word about the stolen supplies? C&apos;mon, elfy, out with it!
[JESTER] *Remark that the rain stayed off on their wedding day. That&apos;s a sign of good luck.*
Village - Houses &amp; Bridge
*Take your leave.*
Decide what to do with Adramahlihk&apos;s soul candle.
*You feel a degree of Source pass from the puppet to you.*
One mortal in a red dress does not trouble me. Travelling this world without a mask, however, leaves me exposed to &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell him that the tinkerer has escaped.*
Cinnamon, not nutmeg. There&apos;s a food shortage in these parts; fresh meat can be... hard to come by. Liberal seasoning helps disguise all sorts of sins.
Change your mind about my offer yet?
*Awooo!*
We&apos;re short-handed. Deserters, if you can believe that. Abandoned their posts and wandered off into the wastelands. Left their friends here to die. It&apos;s shameful.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Too late, you mouldering blight-stained pigs. Grant me power, my ally! &lt;b&gt;GOD KING, I CALL ON YOU! &lt;/b&gt;
Bring it to me.
*&apos;He promised he&apos;d take me home,&apos; you cry. &apos;You are home,&apos; she smiles as she seals the door. &apos;This is where you belong.&apos;*
What&apos;s going on? Why isn&apos;t it attacking?
I suppose patience is a virtue...
You... You WHAT? BASTARD! I told yer smelly arse in confidence and you betray me? Put &apos;em up! PUT &apos;EM UP! Gone teach you a lesson! YAAAHH!!
We shall be who we once were, and the world shall be restored to what it was - &lt;i&gt;before we were betrayed.&lt;/i&gt;
Crafting failed, [1] is dead.
Some of her cargo may remain.
The Master hungers...
And I&apos;m sayin&apos;, you can trust me. I can see a Sourcerer from a mile away.
*She steps close, puts her hands on your chest and leans in.*
campaign description
*In an instant, pretense drops. You may still wear your mask, but your true self is momentarily bared...*
And you can&apos;t be too careful, ya know? If they can get Alexandar, they can get any of us.
Don&apos;t be castin&apos; yer long shadow around here, missus. This here land&apos;s not fer your kind.
But he must trust you if he&apos;s told you about his plan. Could you lead him safely away and finish this? You&apos;d be rewarded if you returned with his head.
*He runs a finger down your neck*
*In the squalor of these hellish surroundings you spy a lone, bewildered figure.*
I hate that it has come to this.
NoTime. NeedFood.
*She steals in close and whispers.*
I don&apos;t know. Tell me, what would you do?
Pay homage to their skills, solve their riddle, and prove yourself... if you can.
*Say you&apos;re sorry; you didn&apos;t think anyone could be saved.*
*Say you&apos;ll do your best, and you&apos;ll pay &lt;i&gt;special &lt;/i&gt;attention to the scourge of demons plaguing the world, too.*
And that? That&apos;ll be a first. &lt;i&gt;That&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;be something I&apos;m looking forward to seeing...
*As you walk away you&apos;re sure hear the lamp jingle slightly, but when you turn around it&apos;s sitting still in the sand. Oh well...*
*Scoff and say that the crab sounds like it has an inferiority complex.*
Marked Crate
*...a barbarian you, wild and free. But then the Sallow Man&apos;s grin becomes a snarl, and his outreached hand grasps at you, grabs hold of a part of you, and &lt;i&gt;pulls...*&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that you were just passing, and take your leave.*
