*Then all you hear, then all that is, is screaming. From the cage to you; their blood in your ears, screaming.*
Insert any rune
Withermoore&apos;s Girdle
Battle Axe
Surely not! A bag of bones like yourself must surely know that death leads to its own treasures. It&apos;s not just decomposing flesh underfoot, you know. Why, the very essence of decay flavours many an essential oil and tincture.
Watch out. It isn&apos;t safe here.
Ah yes. I am the Prime Scion. A revelation that came quite of the blue - which is somewhat ironic considering I&apos;m supposed to be our people&apos;s foremost memory keeper.
&apos;Magister Regional Headquarters &amp; Jail - Driftwood&apos;
Prisoners can&apos;t just VANISH.
Nebulous Crystal
Sweet saviour. Friend of death and fiend of life. How much will you give?
*Tell him if his offer involves killing someone, you&apos;re staying out of it.*
You look mighty suspicious, though.
Automaton Ravager
So it... it wasn&apos;t a dream after all...
*The tablet looks the same, but you cannot touch it. An invisible forcefield of some kind prevents you from touching the mutilated runes again.*
Stop right there. There is no escaping your due punishment.
Braccus betrayed Lucian and Dallis and became a vessel for the God King.
*Tell her you&apos;ve been told as much, and you have an interesting new power to prove it, too.*
You wish to&lt;i&gt; apologise? &lt;/i&gt;We have moved well beyond apologies, father.
We wished for power, and the Djinn offered a magical scimitar.
Immortality is only permanent, my little cub, until one day it simply ceases to be.
I... have something for you. A spear. But... curious. It is gone. If you find who takes it - it is yours.
I need to get back to my bridge! Who knows how many tightwad Voidwoken are scuttling across in my absence...
[Translate48_1e592f2a-018a-4c04-be00-712048faf9d6]
Determines intelligence-based damage you deal.
I&apos;ll remember you said that.
I always thought that the Void was just pure destruction and nothingness... but the gods... they looked like they were being &lt;i&gt;punished&lt;/i&gt;.
I&apos;m not perfect myself - it isn&apos;t for me to judge this one.
*The spirit of the formidable dwarf stands tall before you, hands clasped behind his back, ectoplasmic blood leaking from a wound in his side.*
Come, my prince, let&apos;s retire to that satin nest of mine. Follow me.
Dead Pilgrim
*He notices your presence.*
But how will I know if I&apos;ve been chosen?
*Wonder where he came from.*
No weak links allowed within the chain...
*Stare him hard in the eyes and say you can always beat it out of him.*
Nope. Haven&apos;t smelled her either. She was real bright, you know. Had the best sniffer you&apos;ve ever seen. I guess that&apos;s why they wanted her *whimpers* and not me...
I&apos;ve been so, &lt;i&gt;so &lt;/i&gt;lonely, since my man went away to fight the coming war. I need someone to take care of me. You&apos;re so masculine, darling. Won&apos;t you take care of me?
*The lizard slams her fist against her throne, sending embers flying. One of the stars above her ignites, wreathing itself in flame.*
The spirit of the One survives! May you continue to fight - may you continue to WIN!
*Give the dog Atusa&apos;s nice, juicy leg.*
ARCHIVED
*As you move to ascend the stairs, the skull at the top of the pile creaks around and gazes at you. Well, it &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to be gazing, but there are certainly no eyeballs in those barren sockets.*
The Master is on the Nameless Isle. We should travel with care.
*Say that only she could make the word &apos;visit&apos; sound so sinister.*
Kindly heed my words this time. There will not be another.
*She ignores you.*
As for the older woman... I&apos;ll have to check out the ship&apos;s log. If she&apos;s aboard, I haven&apos;t met her myself. Must avoid us &apos;Reds&apos; when she sees us.
I did not resist the will of the God King, and so he prevailed.
*The spirit turns to meet your gaze. You feel heat upon your skin, the acrid stench of charring flesh assails your nose, and you can hear... screaming; the agonising cries of people, burning alive.*
*Tell her you&apos;re serious.*
Poison Infusion
Elven Apparition
*You stare at the artefact in amazement. Even though it&apos;s broken and suffering from centuries of neglect, there&apos;s no mistaking it for what it is: Eternal technology.*
*Tell him to stay here and rot with the rest of the Divine Order corpses.*
Medium Air Resistance Potion
Right. Right... I get it. I&apos;m lucky to have you around, you know. Even if I can&apos;t... well, never mind.
So, what&apos;s your poison, &lt;i&gt;guv&apos;nor?&lt;/i&gt; A sip or a smoke?
*Reimond&apos;s spirit smiles. The fanatical gleam in his eyes makes him look almost alive once more.*
Pag Koor
Wooden Board
Nope nope nope.
*Note that she can&apos;t have just made those Magisters disappear by herself - not in a place like this. Who&apos;s helping her?*
Travelling light, are you? Smart. I&apos;ve got my whole life in these wagons and look at me! Like a fly in molasses...
Scarlet

Alright, then. I&apos;ll probably regret this, but... be on your way.
Both of them longed for power so absolute it&apos;s no more than an abstract. Yet it is that very abstract that causes so much actual misery for those that stand in its way.
You did well, my prince. You killed the Red Princess before she could achieve her objective and doom us all. Very wise. Very wise indeed.
Amadia&apos;s blessings! What a joyous time to exist. What a glorious day to feel &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;.
Of course! Do you still not see? Do you still not realise there will never be satiety?
Enter feedback here.
*Ask why she&apos;s encouraging you. Doesn&apos;t that just create more competition for her?*
Half of the fun is in the anticipation. But you&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
&lt;i&gt;The Covenant will be kept. I serve you with living and dying breath, my King. Glory be to you!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you&apos;ll have to report him for obstructing you in the &lt;i&gt;execution&lt;/i&gt; of your duty.*
Oh, and Lohse? Lovely little Lohse? Just kill her now and be done with it.
You already know this skill&lt;br&gt;
*The oblong object is crystal-clear and unmarked by marks or chips. It rests snugly in your palm, as if meant to be gripped with a resolute hand.*
*Tell her you owe her no explanation, but she can come and try to get one from you, if she dares.*
Tell me, little man - do you know why the soil here is so very fertile? Do you know why it&apos;s the only place in Reaper&apos;s Coast where blood roses grow?
*The dog gives you a gloomy look, then turns away.*
I go to her. I wish you good luck and I thank you for us all.
Pagan Pants
No, no... I was a scholar, a librarian. Braccus sought the secrets of Source... but he had no patience for sifting through ancient scrolls and tablets...
You smell of Source! Source smells like cabbage, you know.
The Red Prince desperately desires Divinity. I won&apos;t stand in his way.
How about you talk some sense? Those Voidwoken are &lt;i&gt;monsters.&lt;/i&gt;
They said I&apos;m a Sourcerer, too. Like an elf, right? They brought me here without Ma or Pa.
No, I&apos;m quite all right. But thank you.
*Consider this. He wants you to become the next Lucian, then?*
*Say that you tried the stew from the tavern - the meat it contains is that of Magisters.*
[MYSTIC] *Declare that you sense the Magister has a tarnished spirit - he&apos;s inflicted great suffering on many...*
Actions...
I&apos;m afraid. If I leave, I might hurt someone. If I stay, they&apos;ll make me into one of their monsters. I&apos;m... I&apos;m better off dead.
This is incredible! In all my years I&apos;ve never seen the goddess bestow her blessing on someone. I am humbled to be in your presence.
*Say you&apos;ve been in Divine lands for some time.*
The Peacemaker was transporting deadly Deathfog. What is Justinia up to?
Rosa!
Guess I could bullshit you some deep explanation behind it. But, truth be told, Roost always did have an odd sense of humour.
Chain Gloves
*She inspects the ring closely.*
Still on yer feet, ey? Glad to hear it. Feel free to take a gander at the stock, if you&apos;re so inclined.
Ah, Duna - a true god. Stout of heart and fierce of face.
I pledge my soul, O Lucian. Please return.
No cave for you.
The Master is on the isle with no name. We should head there post-haste.
*Speaking of divine business - what&apos;s next? How do you become the Divine?*
Obey him. Honour him. Feed him death.
I&apos;ll take my leave.
Pus-crusted rat! Cack-sniffing whelp! Where ya hidin&apos;, daddy&apos;s boy - where ya hidin&apos;...?
*The spirit remains silent, even as you drain every drop of his lifeblood, his legacy reduced to a final, shivering form.*
Fane travelled Rivellon, notebook in hand, recording the wonders he discovered.
*The cat leans into your palm, rubbing against you and almost unseating his small passanger.*
This option allows you to move selected characters to the cursor position when outside combat.
Hands off. You won&apos;t find anything interesting in there, anyway.
Claim Divinity for yourself.
Well... before there is a Divine, there must be a Godwoken. O-only a special few amongst Sourcerers have this potential... without them, a true successor to Lucian will never rise...
*The scent of incense abounds as the Red Princess reclines luxuriously upon large pillows embroidered with mythical scenes.*
Well, then I&apos;ll call it as I see it. Your legend lives, &apos;n&apos; only the fearsome rebel song&apos;ll do, I say!
*Suggest: &apos;The day has finally come: the Beast will shed his burden!&apos;*
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 16: Necromancy
[MYSTIC] *Tell him to search its thoughts - it wants something.*
*Tell her you had a device just like that once: it&apos;s a portal to safety, right?*
Magister Dallis Report
We have Roost&apos;s severed hand.
You understand, I&apos;m sure.
[Translate58_0e112faa-0eb8-4277-9ae1-107343d5730e]
*The Magister looks far from pleased, an eruption of flop sweat visible on his brow.*
And what became of the elves?
It&apos;s your call. I&apos;ve got your coin either way, so I would suggest getting your money&apos;s worth before I decide we&apos;ve never met. I trust you get my meaning.
Present Lohse to the Doctor.
Pity you don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to be.
*A sudden weariness washes over - bone-deep, and as irresistible as a strong current...*
White Magister Kari&apos;s got the greenhorn on the ropes right now, no doubt. Only a matter of time before he blabs about that mentor of his. He&apos;ll talk. They always do.
&lt;i&gt;Waaaaaaaaaaah!&lt;/i&gt;
And what kind of Divine was Ifan ben-Mezd as the world battled the demons?
*She looks you up and down, then...*
Make Invisible
[SCHOLAR] *Query Tarquin on his knowledge of the demonic tongue.*
&lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt;
*The quality of his clothes: say no man as rich as him lives in a backwater like Driftwood.*
You speak truth. I&apos;ve seen Seekers&apos; blood seeping into the sand. I waded through corpses on the deck of the Lady Vengeance. But when the lifeless eyes looking back at you are your own mother&apos;s...
*A thought suddenly enters your mind, though you&apos;re quite certain it isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;yours.&lt;/i&gt; You hear the voice of Zorl-Stissa in your head: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Do as she says.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
I am Divine! I am the god of gods! All is as it should be.
What a blissful life you must lead, never having to worry about the big questions of the universe.
*Apologise. Ifan&apos;s right.*
*Whine* Please don&apos;t hurt me!
Explosive Mine
Here you stand, a child of the Seven, and yet you chose to deal with a demon! There is no word for such stupidity.
Um... let&apos;s talk about that another time. A time that is not, er, now. You know, later?
