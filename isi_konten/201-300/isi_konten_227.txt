Magisters lie dead at the door of an ancient armoury. Did the door do this to them?
*Ask what happened to him.*
I know, I know. What a crybaby I am. It&apos;s just... you&apos;re so kind. It&apos;s been a difficult day.
Stolen Magister Weapon
Petrifying Touch
*Allow his touch; sense his Source pumping through your heart.*
Now, Godwoken, you have a course. There is less than nothing for you on this bloody rock - my esteemed advice is that you leave. Immediately, if not sooner.
That&apos;s for you to discover. Arx is rife with Divine Order grunts, though. If she&apos;s among them, they&apos;ll know where to look.
*Say that it&apos;s, er, Lenta.*
I&apos;m sorry... we failed you.
Looks like I&apos;ll be handin&apos; the talking stick to someone else next time, eh?
Cloak And Dagger
Let the sad bugger enjoy a little time in the light of day. Even a soulless skell-a-wag deserves that much.
Alright...
It is a lake: a pool of pure Source in which the powers of the Seven lie united.
Death. Death? Is this.... death?
*Tell Leya the feeling is mutual - and ask what&apos;s going on here.*
*The bear yawns.*
Accuracy
The area is heavily guarded. We must be getting closer...
*Apologise for your rudeness, and ask her to continue.*
It&apos;s almost cute, watching these cockroaches in battle. Ain&apos;t no way any of &apos;em will be named the One.
A long, &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; time ago now. Long before Source became a reason to leash us like dogs.
Oh! Bless you, good sir. Bless you!
*About the queen&apos;s plans...*
But given that this entire endeavour is based on my having that will, why don&apos;t you go and fetch it? Or perhaps you don&apos;t feel the need to be paid?
Ben. If he finds his mum in Fort Joy they&apos;re probably both really happy now. So don&apos;t worry. Isn&apos;t that right, missus?
*Wonder what Malady did to keep you from being purged.*
*Cough and politely ask the dwarf what he&apos;s doing.*
Nice to meet another pair of boots anyway.
Watch yourself...
*Tell her to think about it: what will she accomplish here? Nothing but a few hollow moments of vengeance. Your true destinies lie elsewhere.*
*Be on your way.*
Sorry, I&apos;m here with someone else.
You&apos;re so much like him. My instincts tell me to kneel to the new Divine. I&apos;ve done so before, after all. But... I can&apos;t drive myself to do it again.
So tell me, so-called soldier: did you meet with a Magister caravan on your way into town? The hour&apos;s growing late and I&apos;m beginning to worry something might have gone wrong.
*Remark on his predicament. What goes around comes around, yes?*
*Say you&apos;d like to update him on what you found at Mordus&apos; house.*
*Blush and don&apos;t meet her eyes.*
Excellent! We can use this shaft to open one of the vault doors.

[UNDEAD] *Say that you have your secrets, but assure him that a desire to slit his throat is not one of them.*
You... It is you... I have found you... Ifan... Sword of Lucian... failure of the Divine... vermin...
*Ask what the King was so afraid of.*
He married Sadha and they had more dragons.
*Shriekers? Ask Han what on earth a Shrieker is.*
I am the only elf with a human child, I think - but she is mine; she lives in me. I protect her now.
Now... that I was not expecting.
Phoenix Dive Skillbook
Alas, a contract is a contract. Now, if you don&apos;t mind, I&apos;m sure you can find the door.
It was like my hair was being ripped from my scalp. Like my skin was being flayed from my body all at once. I have never felt such horror. It was...
&apos;Right hand&apos; my winker! Fella&apos;s got more right hands than an octopus.
*Even stranger: a shard of polished iron peeks from under the statue&apos;s base. There&apos;s something hidden beneath this massive sculpture.*
We killed the imposter.
*The cat wipes a paw across his eyes and yawns - then emits a belch loud enough to make an ogre jealous.*
Stay away from me...
What? Nonsense, Marcus. It cannot be.
Hold it right there! I&apos;ve been authorised to search all of your belongings. Now let&apos;s have a look.

Was a time he was doin&apos; the queen&apos;s dirty work. Had a change of heart, though. And good on him.

Do you think it&apos;s true, what Malady said? That I&apos;ll never be rid of it now?
Item Sheet
Hmmm? What can I do for ya, lad?
Better to have stayed locked in that box than bandy words with a reprobate like you.
A doubting dormouse, are we? You&apos;re so uninspiring and unimaginative. Off, before I start nibbling at your ankles!
*The marking on the door was painted recently, judging from its pungent scent. You don&apos;t recognise the symbol, but it&apos;s clearly warning you away.*
Your kind. And the dwarves and lizards besides. Those of you that&apos;d see the whole realm eaten up by the Voidwoken &apos;fore you&apos;d change your ways.
To be whole. My armour is of the spores. But the &lt;i&gt;Magisters &lt;/i&gt;steal them.
Dune Beetle Nest
Bock!
Don&apos;t waste my time, inmate! And if you do see him... please do let me know right away.
Uuurrrgh.
*Two eyes on the eagle, back away and take your leave.*
*Godwoken? Ask what he means.*
[SEBILLE] *Frown and say fear doesn&apos;t become a god.*
No- stay back! Not another step closer if you want to live.
Fortify Skillbook
Ah! A tale of cloaks and daggers and daredevilry! You up for it?
And I&apos;m sorry to say you have nothing that I want. But don&apos;t you worry, there&apos;s still lots we can do together.
...I disagree Quercus, it does not need to know about the coming of the Great Acorn, spelling doom for us all.
Dagger
*Tell her you have just the book she&apos;s looking for.*
Only when Braccus Rex&apos;s armour is complete can one wear it with ease.
&lt;i&gt;Alright?&lt;/i&gt;
To that end I suggest we focus on the obvious: a farewell to Fort Joy and a hello to the mainland.
*The creature stares at you like a wolf observing a plump lamb.*
Skeletons - Normal
*Sense the precariousness of your situation and play along. Say you were sent to deliver a message.*
*Demand to know why this is being done to him.*
[Translate27_257a9a19-3152-45e5-a559-82fe508683f8]
… I&apos;m not sure, Quercus, I rather liked the tree&apos;s ornaments…
*The door goes back to its natural state - just a door, nothing more.*
She&apos;s right. You may be the accepted leader of our group, but this is greater than all of us. To deny me now would be a slight I could never forget.
*Say you&apos;re glad to see all that trouble behind you rather than in front of you.*
You are fierce; you are a terrible fury. You will be welcome here.
Not a minute&apos;s rest in this damned city...
Society
It&apos;s Void-worshipping, power-hungry fools like you that have made our actions so necessary. Rivellon needs to be saved from your ilk.
*She doesn&apos;t break eye contact with Lohse as she replies.*
Ain&apos;t had any drink. So why&apos;s it like I just woke up from a week of bingin&apos;?
*You fall to the floor and realise, as you draw your last breath, that your blood is boiling. Your blood is boiling and the debt is paid.*
Make your way to Reaper&apos;s Coast.
&lt;i&gt;You weakling.&lt;/i&gt;
Just you try it, thief! Mother there&apos;s a thief! MOTHER!
*The guard ignores you.*
I do not fall for such rubbish. I am no fool.
We move from one shadow into the next. Death keeps grinning at us with a thousand mouths.
The sails are full and the crew&apos;s in right spirits, barkin&apos; shanties like a chorus of seals. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Tell my mates I sailed the straits, and soon will dock in the echoes&apos; hall!&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Can&apos;t blame it for its maternal instinct...
*Ask what this place is.*
I&apos;ll give him one thing, though: he&apos;s funnier than a five-legged lizard dancing on a frozen lake. Nothing more entertaining than unearned arrogance.
Gwydian thanked us, gave us a skill, then left the Blackpits for good.
You prove my point, dwarf. The Order will set you right... or you will never leave here.
Trilinear
So? What did you and Wither talk about?
Honourable Dallis,
*Urge her to tell you. You&apos;ve got the time.*
*Agree that it seems dangerous. What&apos;s going on?*
What are you doing? I &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;this.
I feel so special.
Why would someone do this to another person...?
*The kid shoves his hands in his pockets and ambles off, resuming his tuneless whistling.*
You can&apos;t draw steel on a Magister. You - you &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t.&lt;/i&gt; D-drop it!

And yes... I know full well what they&apos;ll become. And I know full well they&apos;d rather die a thousand deaths than be used in such ways.
Investigate the Meistr&apos;s cellar.
Hmmm. Delusions such as these are rare, but not unheard of. I recommend a cup of mulled wine and another night&apos;s sleep. Just... take it easy.
You&apos;ll see why I&apos;m sore, if you get to hear the Endless Prayer at the cathedral.
Regardless of who they once were, they&apos;re our Gods now. We should not doubt them.
*She speaks into your neck, her lips brushing against your skin.*
Magister Yarrow rewarded us for finding her father, Migo.
A true, flesh and blood elf might. I cannot say what fortune the likes of you would have.
*Point out you&apos;ve seen her perform incredible feats of magic. Surely she can pull off some grand wizardry now.*
Someone&apos;s missing, isn&apos;t there? Ah, yes, the fearless leader. Better wait, I suppose.

You see? You are the first we save. You do not fear any more, do not&lt;i&gt; serve &lt;/i&gt;-
Now we&apos;re getting somewhere. Another sensation altogether...
Okay. See you later.
*Growl!* You! Fall in line! No special privileges just because you&apos;re tall! Bark!
*Agree. This arrangement sounds good for you both.*
Delicious. Not to mention... illuminating. Thank you.
*Ask what exactly happened to them.*
You can&apos;t think I fall for lies so easily!
Do not forget what I ask of you. Saheila cannot stay here. She is too important. Too rare. Our people must find her.
*Gently affirm that he is truly safe in death. The Doctor has no power over him now.*

You, my brother! Help me find it. There is little time.
Fane... FANE...!
I regret succumbing to his gilded lies. But I know that you can rise up and rip away his grip on our world. You can still free Rivellon, love. You can still free &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
*You&apos;ve almost never heard the old tongue spoken. Ask how he learned it.*
