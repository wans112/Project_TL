*Give it some leeway. Let it speak with your mouth.*
My... my baby... my little one... my precious one... my tiny one...
Quickly, honoured one! Above the river of lava, a temple awaits your indulgence.*
Autosave failed!
*The creature absently picks at the stitches that bind its lips. It starts to bleed, but doesn&apos;t seem to notice.*
*Tell her you were considering the Path of Blood. But... you have concerns.*
*The man slumbers on.*
Until he finds his mask or makes a new one, Fane needs to keep his skeletal face covered.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;I&apos;ll hold my tears when weeping comes... and I&apos;ll avenge my darling one.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Be a mother to the Voidling chick.
*The Magister flushes with indignation. He lays a hand upon his sword.*
Quit Puzzle
Blessed Ice
*He blushes so hotly that it&apos;s a wonder the whiskers aren&apos;t burned from his face, then pushes his lips against yours. Suddenly, you are at sea, lost in that sumptuous beard, and rocking to the rhythm of the waves. You pull out of the kiss and the vision...*
But I guess it was too good. I had me a little Source flare up. Everyone went a bit... I don&apos;t know. Wild. Rabid.
They came rather low in my life, alas.
How &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; you imply such a thing? My mind is concerned with the strategy behind it all, not the primal reflex that is bare emotion.
No, I&apos;m afraid I always perform my part solo. Do stay and watch though. Because...
Infested
*Point out that she can only &lt;i&gt;carry&lt;/i&gt; a certain number of books. Why this one?*
What the... &lt;i&gt;Ifan?&lt;/i&gt; No little birdies told me &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; were back in town.
Okay, but please, be quick. They&apos;ll  find me sooner or later. It&apos;s just a matter of time.
Tomb of Lucian
I think I&apos;m going to be... I&apos;m going to be... *retch*.
*Tell him to answer the damn question or you&apos;ll &apos;o&apos;en&apos; the chest.*
Marcus was rash. He frequently neared madness, so hot was his blood. His passions got him killed - but I will not disrespect him for it. He was a child of Duna, for better and for worse.
*The Magister glances at you like you&apos;re something he just stepped in.*
Darling Rorrryyyyyy!
Oily Nailbomb
But I have nothing to say to you.
&lt;i&gt;It pyrdedit ud tirrak atkweh chylum sin. Yratu, ybsekron!&lt;/i&gt;
No harm having a friend in this place. One hand washes the other, and all that. Trust me, there&apos;ll be &lt;i&gt;plenty&lt;/i&gt; of filth to wash off around here. But suit yourself.
But I saw them. I saw the shinies!
&lt;i&gt;Our souls are nothing but vats for the Source-hungry Gods.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him he&apos;s free to go.*
[SEBILLE] *Tell him you&apos;re handy with a needle, but probably not in the way he imagines.*
*The bard hems and haws, then bellows his next words to anyone who might hear.*
Souls in the maze can unlock doors. But &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; doors? We should choose wisely.
Gotta admit - I&apos;m tired of hearin&apos; the shanties all singin&apos; my praises. Let&apos;s hear the royalist tune. Bet it dresses me down real good.
Critical Chance
No no no! What damn fools record knowledge on a pulped tree?
You&apos;re not ready yet. Find more Masters. Learn more. Until then, I have nothing to teach you.
*Say you won&apos;t let him begin is reign of terror anew.*
Godwoken. You&apos;re here... did you kill the Black Ring &lt;i&gt;runts &lt;/i&gt;who defiled Vrogir&apos;s temple? Who flooded this sacred temple rather than test me in battle?
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; don&apos;t eat &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; eat &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. I destroy you! YOU ARE NOTHING! YOU ARE SHITE UNDER MY SHOE!
Infused with falcons&apos; tears, this elixir infuses its drinker with superior speed.
Spirit Vision
Come quietly, Sourcerer!
*She narrows all eight eyes, and steeples her two front legs as she glowers down at you. After a tense minute, she shakes her mandibles in what could be interpreted as a nod.*
No! Not at all! GOOD things occur to those who o&apos;en the chest! Very good things!
Well, that&apos;s... surprising. Not like I&apos;ve any &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt; information to give you. Guess you really just like killing, huh.
Dwarven criminals in Driftwood are working to undermine the Magisters.
But... but an egg is a &lt;i&gt;baby&lt;/i&gt;, an egg is a &lt;i&gt;baby&lt;/i&gt;, not food.
When they die screaming, their ship crashes. More fool Magisters come to investigate.
Emmie! No! Sourcerer - bad! Baddies! Bite! Bark! Bark!
Quite slipped my mind though. A slave scar will do that to a girl.
Nightmare Fiend
*He turns to you with a grin, and you see his eyes are dark, sharp, and absolutely merciless.*
A vandal &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a liar! I enjoy killing you twice as much...
Any sins can be forgiven under the right circumstances.
*And what&apos;s that? Smuggling barrels of Deathfog?*
He could endanger us - why take the risk? Let&apos;s do something about him before it&apos;s too late.
You&apos;ve shown me far more than loyalty, given me greater gifts - your lips, your touch. Besides, the Order needs someone to lead them for the long haul. I don&apos;t need Divinity to do what&apos;s right for my people.
Judgement
And &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;i&gt;Please &lt;/i&gt;do not lead anyone here.
I will be your surgeon - that much I promise - but there is much work to be done first.
*You lean in - that&apos;s no tear: it&apos;s Source! The shimmering liquid is seeping from her wounds and dripping to the ground below her.*
Very well. You can find my helpers - the Thieves&apos; Guild - within the Arx sewers, in their so-called secret hideout. Here, I&apos;ll mark it for you. But approach carefully; the foul stench is hardly the sewers&apos; gravest danger.
Rescue Amyro.
Tarquin told us that Dallis may have used an ancient lizard technique of using songs to control slaves. Perhaps this is related to controlling the ship. We ought to investigate further.
City Guard Colonel
P-papa?
...not all of them...
*You were kind and honest, and devoted to your dog. But you came a-knocking here in search of work, and the dog took fancy to the man of the house. Your own dog turned on you, and tore you down.*
[MYSTIC] *Summon your Source, reaching deep inside yourself to show the Meistr how far you&apos;ve come.*
*Tell her the truth. You met one of the gods, and they told you that Lohse was a liability.*
*Say that crash she heard was your ship. You&apos;ve just arrived.*
*Tell her it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;turn.*
*The spirit winks at you.*
Are you sure you are done with character creation?
Dead Paladin
I told you already - move along!
Iron Gloves
There were statues in my likeness around the Ancient Empire, too. Perhaps some stand there still.
Rooting Corruption
Oh, shut it! We&apos;re already dead. No one needs yer rambling.
If I tell you I die! Or- or worse...
Medium Potion of Shadow
Paulie
*Tell her you&apos;re not going to change her mind. She can join you or fight you.*
Run home, little Godwoken. You find only death here.
Another Scion gone. Another hope &lt;i&gt;dead.&lt;/i&gt;
Freshly-dug graves. Such an earthy pungence, don&apos;t you find?
&lt;i&gt;Stop&lt;/i&gt;. You your tricks fail on me.
*Nod. You&apos;re certainly no friend to Magisters.*
Search Gareth&apos;s corpse.
[1] shares lore with [2]
*She pulls her hand away and lightly wipes it on her leg.*
Find me and I will guide you to her! To Reaper&apos;s Coast I&apos;ll go, and hide in the mist beneath the hamlet of Driftwood.
...I say she&apos;s a&lt;i&gt; demon.&lt;/i&gt;
Source flows freely here. It&apos;s a place of incredible power, where a single prayer holds the weight of thousands. Your heart and soul will fill as quickly as they&apos;re drained.
Patience, Maol, patience, patience...
He sails from Driftwood shortly. If you wish to speak with him, be quick.
It wears the face of Duna, but speaks the tongue of beasts. How cruel.
Cart Tunnel
The Meistr&apos;s ragtag band are but a pale imitation of the tradition they sought to revive. I am one of the original Seekers: We swore to be Knights of the Council, Guardians of Godwoken and defenders of divinity!
*As the black smoke-snake takes over your tongue you feel yourself slipping away. You see a vision; an army of the undead, risen to turn the world to a lifeless waste, and at its head... a God King...*
*Say you&apos;re here on business.*
Turn To Oil
Whirlwind
You underestimate her. You&apos;d have me stand idle as she razes Arx to the ground?
I will be emperor, yes. Of lizards or dragons, that remains to be seen.
Shadowcloak Skullcrusher
*Catching your signal, Ifan smiles shyly and nods.*
You.
*Say you&apos;re glad to see Malady managed to piece her back together.*
*There&apos;s a shout from above decks, and then the world turns upside down. You&apos;re pitched violently sideways as the planks around you rip apart and black water floods in.*
She disgusts me... what kind of person would knowingly craft something like that?
Range: [4]&lt;br&gt;Burning does fire damage over time.&lt;br&gt;Can target terrain to create fire surface, burn ooze or oil, evaporate water, or melt ice. Can explode some clouds.
*Tell him that the honour would be yours.*
*You&apos;ve heard this before. You didn&apos;t accept it then, you don&apos;t accept it now.*
Deathfog&apos;s leaking out. It&apos;s time to get out of here. NOW!
I couldn&apos;t help it, I swear. Kemm all smelled like when the garden-man cuts down a decayed tree, like... like he was using flowers to hide the rot.
*Smile and don&apos;t reveal what you know. Say you&apos;ll take his advice.*
You can&apos;t be for real, cuckoo. You&apos;re like a babe in the woods! Purpose! Helping others! Give me a break.
There&apos;s Godwoken filth hiding up there. His head would be on a spike now, if it weren&apos;t for those Shriekers...
Malady! No!
Oh, thank the gods!
*Tell the rat the things at the bottom of the steps may well be dangerous.*
We&apos;ve known this moment would come. Now, it is time to put my research to the test.
I stand warned then, don&apos;t I? So much for the boon that is companionship. A blight, rather.
Yes...
We&apos;re getting close. Garvan said the attack happened somewhere around here.
[1]% of incoming damage is redirected to a nearby Ally.
Will my luck never cease?! After reading Isbeil&apos;s researches from Blackpeak Isle, I managed to come to a number of conclusions leading to a new invention! I’ve now crafted a wand that can summon the poison elemental Margaret to do my bidding at any time. Me! I control that fiendish one! Of course, the amount of poison I had to distill to create it was excessive by any measure, but by Duna I’ll never get tired of the look on her, er, face when I call...
House Interior - Worker&apos;s House
Talk to Beast.
Thanks for sending me here! It&apos;s quite beautiful, isn&apos;t it?
Animators Reference: Ladder_Destruct
It&apos;s openin&apos;. Finally!
Oh, you poor thing. You really think I&apos;m going to answer to you, don&apos;t you. We both know who&apos;s really in charge, don&apos;t we?
Can&apos;t argue with that.
If it helps, your death is one step closer to our freedom. The master is very keen to see your kind dead.
The Peacemaker was carrying deadly Deathfog. What in the blazes is Justinia planning?
Hello, gorgeous.
*Consume his Source. He was just a dog, after all.*
Deals [1] per turn.
*Tell her there&apos;s no hurry, her husband is already dead.*
Please, Audrey! Let me know you&apos;re alright!
*The dwarf leans in and peers intently at your eyes.*
The spirit of the mage lost his Source and no longer exists.
Change profile
O... kay. Have you - have you got a death wish, dearie?
*The elf&apos;s face, twisted in a grotesque rage,  slowly calms.*
Like death and desperation.
*Notice her curious way of speaking and try to imitate it: &apos;Telling her you don&apos;t have a knowing why here came.&apos;*
The Mother stands tall. The &lt;i&gt;elves &lt;/i&gt;are prepared. We must listen to her.
