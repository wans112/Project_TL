Memorise Skill
My chosen! Now is our chance.
Nobody I&apos;d rather see this whole thing through with.
Broken Mask
Peep peep. Peep.
*You can no longer stand by. Show them the true power of Source.*
Oaken Longbow
*Press your forefinger to your lips. The less attention he draws to you, the better.*
And still you linger? While my Soul Jar goes unbroken? Avaunt!
I heard there&apos;s a bard in this quarter who&apos;s got the best set of lungs in Arx. We could use a merry tune or two after what&apos;s happened...
You did? You found the greasy rat? Tell me everything. But wait... you have proof, right?
Roost Anlon. I own this place. I&apos;d ask you to introduce yourself, but I already know who you are, &lt;i&gt;Beast&lt;/i&gt;. Or do you prefer being called &apos;Godwoken&apos;?
*She hesitates, but you can tell she wants to speak.*
*Hold up the ring that you found - the one she took off the dead Magisters.*
I can almost see you... I can almost make you out...
Summon becomes immune to Fire damage. Also grants Epidemic of Fire and an additional Pyrokinetic skill (depending on summon).
The powers of the Seven are the key. Once you have claimed them as your own, use them to open a gateway to the Void so we may return.
Ah - the language of the demons! I consider it my scholarly duty to know what I can of them. There&apos;s a trove of information to be had, as long as you know... who to ask.
*The bull flips its ghostly tail at a non-existent fly. It registers your presence.*
Farewelllllll, sweet Rrrrory. I only had eyeeeeees for yooooooooooooou...
&apos;East - Marketplace&lt;br&gt;West - Driftwood Fishworks
*The spirit stands quietly, fearfully.*
Bye-bye, lizard lady.
She ran the ship upon the rocks, although I rang the bell. That weren&apos;t no lighthouse, I could tell. I rang the bell in warning and she ran the ship upon the rocks!
*He leans in and whispers, his voice hoarse with a desperate longing.*
*Do nothing.*
[IFAN] *Tell her she&apos;s got you confused with someone else.*
*Blood seeps from Jonathan&apos;s wound and pools at Gareth&apos;s feet. He stares at the stream as it carves a path around his boots.*
*Say that you&apos;ve already passed the Path of Blood.*
*He pointedly ignores your question. The far-off cry of a child at play can be heard - unsettling when contrasted with the grisly scene before you. Ifan closes his eyes as the child calls &lt;i&gt;&apos;My turn to be the Lone Wolf!&apos;&lt;/i&gt; to his companions.*
[IFAN] *Say that you bring no word for them. No word at all.*
Lohar trusts you, buck. Don&apos;t disappoint him.
*Tell him he knows what you want: Freedom. And you&apos;ll get it at any cost.*
Grasp of the Starved Skillbook
[NOBLE] *Insist this line of questioning is below a dwarf of your station. You shall enter forthwith.*
Still, it would be a shame to see any harm come to it. Here&apos;s a little something I uncovered in my research.
Alertness
Since the Deathfog, such a time comes... but someone hunts our Scions. Someone takes them from us, one by one.
*The statue speaks! Ask what spirit lives within.*
*A soothing sensation dips and waves through you, entering you from the air itself. As the feeling fades, you realise you&apos;ve become replete with Source.*
*Ask if the problem is physical or magical.*
I must bow before your majesty. I should have known I could never lay before you an untrod path to walk. You make your own path, my prince. May it lead you to greatness beyond greatness!
[The page looks to have been ripped out of a larger tome.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...said by locals to be a shard of the infamous weapon knows as Anathema - and perhaps even responsible for causing Johanna Surrey&apos;s descent into madness. If the ageing dowager was ever aware of the family heirloom&apos;s value, she never let on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the months before her death, Johanna&apos;s mind was lost to hate and hallucination. She would come to mysteriously chant &apos;Two, One, Three!&apos; at the few servants that remained as they attended to her bizarre beauty rituals. By the...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[You notice the same succession of numbers mentioned in the text has been scribbled in the page&apos;s margins: 2-1-3.]
You&apos;re a little tall to be asking questions like that.
...what happened here?
[BARBARIAN] *Explain that you&apos;re just trying to survive in this world.*
Physical Armour
I will, won&apos;t I?
*The pictograms on the jar stand fixed and still.*
*He stands to attention.*
*Reply with &apos;Braccia&apos;.*
Away from me, king slave.
*Tell her you&apos;re a dwarf.*
[1] absorbed all damage from [2] : [3]
Come now, Lohse. Don&apos;t you want to &lt;i&gt;play?!&lt;/i&gt;
Can you not speak without spewing lies? Death comes, crook!
*Say you&apos;ve been trained by the Master. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; make him suffer. You &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; make him suffer. So yes: you can intimidate him.*
*Hackles raised, the dog barks at the sand built up beneath the building. It turns towards you, like it&apos;s trying to tell you something.*
*Agree to take a look.*
*Ask what she&apos;ll do now.*
*Step aside. They&apos;re free to go.*
You seen it?
*Leave the hatch be.*
[ELF] *Kneel before the spirit of Eleanessa. Great has been her anguish.*
My mask! She stole it! If these savages see me without it, they will have my skull for a goblet.
*Ask the God King why his shrine lies in such a place.*
*Tell Roost you are Godwoken... and so is Ifan.*
Abyssal Void Devourer
Traitors like you - you have no code. You blindly ricochet from one conflict to the next, stirring the pot while scolding the virtuous. You pretend to have honour. But you&apos;re a fraud.
Be strong, ben-Mezd. The Halls await you...
Ah, you again! Got the coin to pass, have you?
[FANE] *Nod silently. Anything that takes their eyes off you is welcome.*
Demonic Surfeit
*The girl winks at you, then tosses you a single gold coin.*
Thank you so, so, so much for helping my ma. All those Voidwoken! Thank the gods everyone is ok.
I discovered the name of the demon haunting Bloodmoon Island: Adramahlihk. Now Jahan can perform the exorcism!
*Ask her how she intends to achieve such a feat, given that she&apos;s female.*
*Her eyes go wide with wonder upon your mentioning of a divinity.*
But I&apos;m sure &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;already in-the-know.
Blackfinger
Well... it&apos;s not often that you get to see yourself in &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;state, is it?
Sir! Can you hear me?
Careful now, nobody likes burnt fingers...
*Swallow it down.*
*The deck beneath you lets out a disdainful creak.*
Now, I really must get back to my work...
*Your closer scrutiny yields nothing further - it&apos;s just an old lever by the look of it.*
You&apos;ll find Demira in Driftwood and Donna in Arx. Dagmare... well, I don&apos;t quite know where she&apos;s got herself perched these days.
When they come again they&apos;ll be stronger. I doubt we&apos;ll hold. But hold we must.
Magisters. Not what they signed up for, I bet.
*Ask what happened to her eggs.*
*Wait, that voice... it&apos;s the same as the elf you saw down below.*
*Its eyes widen in terror, and it opens its mouth to howl - and then it&apos;s gone.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve learned a great deal since last you met. You are ready.*
Now, if you would be so kind: my bonds?
That... can&apos;t be good for him.
*Offer to rearrange his face with your fist if he doesn&apos;t release you right &lt;i&gt;now.*&lt;/i&gt;
Things ain&apos;t lookin&apos; good. I know the queen&apos;s up to no good in Arx, but my lead is good and dead. You ain&apos;t the most strappin&apos; lass I&apos;ve seen, but you&apos;re better &apos;n a floppin&apos; corpse. Probably.
You&apos;ll see for yourself. They take us for food. They take us for food for their spawn. They&apos;ll take you too.
Expedient magic, actually. The ship is made of livewood - it has the spirit of an elven Ancestor Tree within it. It seems Dallis has found a way to bind that spirit to her.
*Pirating sounds fun. Tell him you&apos;d pillage and plunder to your heart&apos;s content.*
That&apos;s mighty kind of ya. Can&apos;t very well do it myself. Well. You probably guessed that.
And water from springs of course, and flowers from the ground, but you catch my drift.
I can see through your lies, killer!
With a new Divine at the helm, Malady had a powerful ally.
Take me.
*Shrugs.* Seems the Magisters have been dicing with dark magic. You&apos;d have them to thank, if there were any left. Many fled. Those who didn&apos;t died... or ended up in a cell.
We had no choice. In the face of the Void&apos;s onslaught, our individual powers would never have been enough. Although we still had the sense to leave him a mortal.
Show some sense and hold your tongue! People are on edge as it is without newcomers looking for trouble.
*Ask him to tell you what he knows.*
*Hesitate... it&apos;s awfully convenient that he&apos;s here, right now.*
[HERO] *Tell the guard you&apos;re sorry, but you have to do something unheroic now. Then kill her.*
No. Not anymore, or so I hope.
To be perfectly frank... yes. I only had to do what comes natural to me.
...and I thank you for acknowledging my humble part in its outcome.
They... fell. I watched my own hands slaughter them. I tried to resist, but I... couldn&apos;t. And then a final roar, when the demon rushed away and into the only one still standing. The doctor.
*Nothing stirs in the dank and stinking basement. And yet you feel an imminent... presence.*
You lookin&apos; for a match? You&apos;ll have a good head on most of the competition, that&apos;s for certain. A good tail, too. Poor lugs won&apos;t know what hit &apos;em.
A Voidwoken attack has left the Ancient Empire consulate consumed by fire.
Awful day for it, don&apos;t you think?
Spiky Trunk
We operated on the young woman, and she&apos;ll make a full recovery. Swann should be pleased.
*Ask him if he wants to do this... &lt;i&gt;together.*&lt;/i&gt;
Die, Godwoken!
Hold up, right this instant! Once more I must call you to attention like a naughty schoolchild!
I pray my child will return from the final battle. My prince will find me, and together we&apos;ll rule an empire the likes of which the world has never seen.
All this commotion&apos;s bad for business.
Of course, who else? The Keeper of the Cathedral isn&apos;t just another priest - he must be kept safe.
Spontaneous Combustion Skillbook
*Tell him you&apos;re impressed he cracked the spell! Shouldn&apos;t he use it... now?*
You may yet be the One. You prove yourself again. And again. And again.
*She points at her head.*
*Ask Han how he got that vicious-looking wound.*
Thank you. And. Hurry. Please.
*She searches your face, looking for the truth, or for perfidy. Finds neither.*
Why the long faces? Right?
Blank Summoning Skillbook
We decided to escape without help.
Mystical Small Rock Rune
*The fletcher trembles before the mass of bodies littering the camp, then looks you in the eyes.*
Perhaps we would do better to move inland a little? I&apos;m quite sure I saw a fort in the distance.
*The rat breathes a long sigh of relief, closes its eyes, and steels itself for what&apos;s coming...*
Allow Sebille her shot at Divinity.
[LOHSE] *Easy! Say you&apos;d be entertaining the masses, a lute on your back and your belly full of beer.*
But please, I beg you, have mercy!
You like it spicy! I know you&apos;ll enjoy this sample so much, you&apos;ll come back wanting more.
But more than his lover, I was his partner. I discovered his power to feed on the Source of others, and I allowed it to - no, I &lt;i&gt;made &lt;/i&gt;it happen.
*Tell him you&apos;re not sure you&apos;re talking to the same head you talked to before.*
