So yeah. No bowing. But how about... a handshake?
A large, well-made bar of metal fairly itching to be hammered into something useful.
Tir-Cendelius, I pray to you for my Seeker brethren. Show us the path to salvation.
*Gently push on the door while it&apos;s distracted.*
Good. Good. I don&apos;t know of how much help &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&apos;ll be, but I&apos;m glad to hear we&apos;re on the side of Red Prince.
The Reckoning
Chain Lightning
I do love that in a man...
*She gives you a look that says &apos;slow down&apos;.*
You talk funny. An&apos; I bet your pockets are full. Here! Everyone out! Trolls - kill these grown-ups!
Quercus! Please, have some dignity! I swear, civility is dead...
The hoard of a human hero.
We shall both wanderers be. It is a good fate.
*Agree to go quietly.*
*Invite him to tell you more about the Red Princess.*
Every time someone casts a Source Spell in combat you receive a 20% chance of gaining a Source Point.
*Ask where he is now.*
Until next time.
Broken. No good in a Voidwoken fight anyway.
&lt;i&gt;Of course he did!&lt;/i&gt; Every Godwoken here was a threat to his legacy, so he did away with them. Now, once I&apos;m rid of you, I will be free to succeed him.
Hey - if we&apos;ve been given a second chance, then I&apos;m making the most of it!
*Hiss...*
*Let your hands explore his body.*
He is no more, thank the goddess. It has been many centuries since he walked Rivellon, although he still casts a shadow over this land.
because Fane is now my master.
*Try to shake off the smell of death; you want to remember...*
Now, in my day we were a proper mill turning around half-a-ton of timber by the day. No mean feat for an operation this size, I tell you!
You pray at my shrines? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, my most wayward cub?
Wood Drop
*Ask about the wedding.*
This should protect you from stray blows and arrows. That is, if you know how to wield it.
[SCHOLAR] *You recognise the signs of her current state: tell her she&apos;s in shock.*
Nailbomb
I&apos;m watching, you elf. And make no mistake: so&apos;s the Divine.
*You feel a gentle heat and the fog starts to dissipate, slowly revealing a once-familiar sight.*
*Gazing into the middle distance with what you hope is a look of pure wisdom, mumble something under your breath.*
*The spirit of a Black Ring witch stands over her remains, loudly petitioning the sky above.*
Holding this translucent blade causes your hands to shudder and your head to tingle.
*Say you understand. You&apos;ll not press him further.*
*Every day you learn more about the devastating consequences of the Deathfog: the Deathfog you carried unknowingly for Lucian. You feel fire blaze in your heart and a storm surge in your mind.*
Chameleon Cloak Skillbook
[ELF] *Shake your head. A lungful of Deathfog would be too good for a liar like him.*
...then the ties that bind me here are severed. No homestead is safe. But any other is safer than this one.
I&apos;ll be here awhile yet, &lt;i&gt;luronta&lt;/i&gt;. Come back later with the right coin if you wish to hear a poem...
I can&apos;t believe that I made it all the way here just to get locked out of Arx. Never missed a Lucian&apos;s Day in my life... until now.
*Ask about Mord&apos;Akaim - what was it exactly?*
*Say that thanks are all well and good, but a little something for your trouble is even better.*
Fish Piles
Why I oughta... I oughta... I OUGHTA... BARK!
We were dragons once.
The Red Prince still seeks Sadha. Could she be in Arx?
*With a sad smile he looks down, tears out several more pages, and then throws them to the wind.*
Like I want to keep exploring. Again. And again. And again.
Bandit Dwarf Bodyguard
Bully
The Master is dead. I am the new Mother of elvendom. With the powers of Divinity I can protect my people.
*He waves a little scrap of paper in front of your eyes before patting it back into his breast pocket, a smug smile on his lips.*
We were asked to investigate the commotion at the local storage cave.
Old friend. What have you become?
So? Go on - pretty fantastic, isn&apos;t it? You&apos;re a step closer toward becoming &lt;i&gt;like one of them, &lt;/i&gt;now.
*The shard responds with another sequence of unusual and ominous words. This language is beyond your comprehension.*
I was so naive. The God King told me I was... special. He came close, and then closer still. Hearing him, feeling him - it was like crashing over a cliff and having him catch me, over and over.
So the gods were bound and cursed by the Void, and the thing - the &lt;i&gt;very powerful &lt;/i&gt;thing - inside you told you they weren&apos;t long for this world.
[IFAN] *Say that your &lt;i&gt;&apos;eternal gifts&apos; &lt;/i&gt;for serving Lucian must have got lost in the post. Tell Gareth Lucian wasn&apos;t the blameless hero he worships.*
Only the elven Godwoken could bring the elves together once more.
[SEBILLE] *Say that frankly you don&apos;t. Is it like being a princess in a golden dress riding a unicorn?*
We helped Gareth avenge his parents. He seems different now.
*Feed Mabel the potion.*
*Tell her you&apos;re not used to fighting for your life like this. You miss when things were a bit more steady. Secure.*
Darling, you&apos;re alright!
Bygones and vestiges, from ocean to forest!
*Ask him if he wants to stick together; you can protect him.*
*Suddenly, you hear a booming voice, disorienting you.*
Something to sink my teeth into!
*Confront him for his crime: he slayed Gareth&apos;s parents!*
*You&apos;re not quite certain you&apos;ll ever sleep soundly with Sebille in any sort of proximity, but at least she&apos;s on your side - for the moment.*
Allies in range receive Venom Coating, which adds [1] to weapon skills and attacks.
Vase
*Tell her you&apos;re sure there are plenty more bad things in the world.*
Just so. My mouth is a little dry to join in your... discharge, but I share the sentiment.
*Squ-e-e-e-e-a-a-a-k!*
It seems I&apos;m destined to liberate the dwarves. Duna gave me the power to bless and warned that I should not trust the Godwoken.
*Tell him the God King wishes him to help you. If he looks in his heart he will know it.*
*She taps a fingernail on the glass of amber ale she offered you before. It&apos;s still full.*
[IFAN] *Tell him your name is Ifan.*
*The squirrel guides its cat over to you, chittering as it goes. It reaches up and hands you a piece of bark.*
My queen... gone. If there&apos;s any solace in her death, it&apos;s that I might again see her in the Hall of Echoes.
famed for its prosperity, its culture, its diversity,
How? Through violence? I&apos;ve already suffered more than any would think possible - there is nothing more you can do to me. My secret leaves this world with me.
It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;forgiving&lt;/i&gt; that I&apos;ve more trouble with.
*The skull before you curls into a maggot-eating grin.*
UI Down
*Raise your ample eyebrows. He knows who you are, clearly. And he is...?*
Spread Your Wings
*Say you hope he&apos;s right.*
What kind. Of idiot. Uses &apos;magic word&apos;. As their. Magic word?
*She keeps a gentle pace, then begins moving faster, harder, sweat glistening on her collarbone.*
Ashwood Bow
Why can&apos;t I escape? Why is there never a way out?
Then you&apos;re finished. The demon will destroy you and who knows how many more - all because you couldn&apos;t do what you needed to do.
Lead the man out of his house.
N-no, please! Help! Someone, &lt;i&gt;help - !&lt;/i&gt;
Belt of Virtue
Very, very well - that&apos;s how. That cargo is worth more than a pretty penny, and I&apos;ll owe its retrieval to you and  you alone.
*The God within you reacts - his emotions a cocktail of fury and fear. You hear his voice, demanding that you give him control - demanding your body obey his will.*
Caps Lock
Thing I love about this place: all these Lone Wolves at the alert. Ready to rip to shreds anything... unusual... at any moment.
*Say that if he truly saved you from drowning, you owe him your thanks.*
*The spirit of an older man observers the nearby painter. He tut-tuts to himself.*
What infernal business is this...
*Show your confusion. He must be mistaken.*
But I trust my friends. More than I trust myself.
Help, thief!
Sadha gave us her egg. With a little fiery encouragement it&apos;ll hatch.
*Say you&apos;ve spoken to one of the Seven themselves. You intend to be their champion as best you can.*
A collection of a Magister’s notes regarding a strange spore. Use to read.
Reliquary
*Frown and ask him if he&apos;s noticed he&apos;s in a Void-infested land, along a Void-infested sea.*
Glass from the Merchant Estate... with no sign of poison on it.
[JESTER] *Tell him you just can&apos;t imagine anything better than sharing hooch in prison with an assassin.*
BE-HO-HO-HERAWKAWRICKA! Behold! It is I! The Magicockerel!
I can feel it. How weak he&apos;s become. I can do this. This is it!
*Note that a weapon is not normally meant to taste its owner&apos;s blood.*
Value of player offer:
You&apos;re kidding, surely. I&apos;m not falling for such an obvious trick. Come on, then, off to prison.
Merchant&apos;s Garden
We repaid our debt to Sanguinia Tell.
Giant Masterwork Rune
I was looking at his bone structure for academic purposes. There&apos;s nothing to be jealous of! Honestly…
The world is yours now. I pray you&apos;ll treat it better than we did.
*From the dark, you stare up at the thin slivers of light visible between the floorboards. Shadows ripple across the slivers, accompanied by heavy footsteps... &lt;i&gt;Magister &lt;/i&gt;footsteps...*
Praise be to the Divine, for a miracle walks among us.
Wits affect your Critical Chance, Initiative, and your ability to detect traps and find hidden treasures.
Don&apos;t stand between a prince and his principles! The Magisters learned that the hard way.
*She leans back, her face shining, eyes dancing, radiating freedom, love, joy itself.*
Slane appeared and helped us.
Scalemail Equip
This place is strange... I cannot bear you away from here... you must find other means so that we can leave.
*Say you&apos;re interested in someone with an affinity for the arcane arts.*
*Apologise for making light of the situation, and ask about these disappearances - they have a suspect?*
You there! Girl! Did Braccus send you? Is he ready to apologise?
*The cat and the dog appear to be arguing.*
All this - for nothing? No - I can start again. A clean slate. Just as long as they don&apos;t know I had anything to do with...
*Tell him you&apos;re not afraid, but it does no good to dwell on the past.*
The Devourer will speak and show you the way.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for what you&apos;ve done. I just wish- ... well, it&apos;s too late now.
Return to Driftwood.
Kicked me out though. All &apos;cause I took some stupid plate from the stash. I&apos;s just tryin&apos; to show &apos;em I could, I swear!
&lt;i&gt;...and now so must you.&lt;/i&gt;
Nothing. Empty as Dallis&apos;s heart.
If this is all the Void has to offer, we&apos;re bound to emerge victoriously.
Dead Ringer
*Flee.*
*Say you haven&apos;t.*
*Say you tire of prophecy. You&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;prince.&lt;/i&gt; You want your throne and your empire!*

That&apos;s why Dallis dragged me here. Tied me up like a Shrieker and forced me to speak to all the dead in the caves. Told me to ask them where &lt;i&gt;&apos;The Aeteran&apos; &lt;/i&gt;is.
Stop right there. Last warning.
Honey, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; should be paying &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
MessageBox Other 2
My my, a fellow aficionado! How rare to meet someone else interested in the corporal arts. Won&apos;t you stay?
*Ask what they will do now.*
