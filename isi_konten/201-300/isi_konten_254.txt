You&apos;re glad, are you? How very curious. For word has reached me through a very &lt;i&gt;sour&lt;/i&gt; grapevine indeed, that you turned your back on your fellow passengers. Left us to fend for ourselves...
*Note that she too has survived the Deathfog. Ask how...*
*Casually ask him how he feels about the, you know, living impaired.*
*Arhu pauses. He considers you. He nods.*
*Before you go, ask what it is she did to your eyes exactly.*
It is all prepared. It is ready. I am too weak to go. But I must care for Saheila. You release me, and I show you the way out.
Godwoken. You should leave. The Mistake must atone, as must we.
Adapts to dangerous situations with transformational tricks of nature
These heavy gauntlets resemble a dragon&apos;s massive claws. Every joint is made of polished bone.
Another penny for a sick dog?
*Expressionless, nod for him to continue.*
Black Shroud
*The thing thrashes against your control. You can feel it hissing that you &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;to let it speak - that this creature is dangerous.*
Lady luck was on our side. Next time we should ensure we&apos;ll have no need of her!
*Sebille grabs you by the arm, her nails embedding themselves into your flesh.*
Valuable artefacts, heirlooms and antiquities!
*Grimace and regret the path you have taken with this sovereign of slime. Inform her you must leave anon!*
*Your best friend Raedalus was your rival. You knew that he was weak. You made sure the Chancellor knew it too. And while your friend was in the Chancellor&apos;s secret room...*
Supplies
Key to the Back Room of the Alchemist&apos;s House
*Decline to answer. Your purposes are yours alone to know.*
Fluorescent Voidling
Explode, creating acid surfaces and dealing poison damage in a large area around you (except areas blocked by cover).
A shadow of something... unpleasant... lurks in the corner of the &apos;Tyrant&apos;s Helm&apos;...
*Move closer to him.*
*Say nothing. You don&apos;t know what to say.*
*Ask if he expects Mordus to survive that particular conversation.*
*No password? Blank-faced, pretend you don&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about.*
[1] increases the range of skills and scrolls by [2]m. Does not affect melee and touch-range skills.
Worse than this? Can such a thing be true?
It is enough.&lt;i&gt; No more.&lt;/i&gt;
*Keep listening. She seems very inclined to talk.*
[1] needed [2]: base [3] with [4]% reduction from [5]
Dead Magisters don&apos;t tend to buy weapons.
Hope you&apos;re behaving yourself, freshie.
The Doctor approves. He will see you now.
If that&apos;s all, sir.
There&apos;s a vandal skulking about. And have guilt written all over you...
But if you should bring shame to that holy accoutrement, I will find you in the Hall of Echoes myself.
Wrong! You may be beautiful, but you&apos;ve got the brains of an elf. Pay up now, or we&apos;ll have to play some other games with you, seeing as you&apos;re such a playful thing.
A talking shell you picked up from the beach. It&apos;s been quiet ever since you picked it up. Especially since you cooked it. Those pitiful cries of pain and agony were deafening.
*Sebille scours the horizon wistfully, tension apparent in her features.*
Investigate the schoolhouse.
Can&apos;t reach
*Sigh.* I can&apos;t believe she&apos;s dead. Such a waste.
You almost didn&apos;t make it.
There&apos;s no time to spare - Dallis must be marshalling her forces against us. We must sail.
What say you?
Didn&apos;t get enough?
&lt;i&gt;I sufferrr&lt;/i&gt;.
*The child nods and reaches up to you. As you hold her, her breathing grows slow and calm. Her wet face is damp on your neck. She lets go and looks up at you with a small smile.*
*She stares directly at you and bares her teeth.*
The Death Room
The thing inside her is voracious. It&apos;s a testament to her strength that it hasn&apos;t long since consumed her whole.
We discovered that the sentries in Kemm&apos;s attic are vulnerable to Source Vampirism.
Ben... ben-Mezd. Ifan ben-Mezd! You killed them. YOU KILLED THEM! HE KILLED THEM ALL! &lt;i&gt;MURDERER!&lt;/i&gt;
I doubt a reptile could appreciate the beauty of Barstan&apos;s gentle melodies. I consider myself fortunate, to be carried to paradise by his silken voice.
Halt! Due to recent thefts, I must search all of your belongings for stolen goods.
Your heart knows nothing of justice. Your heart is not pure. You learn nothing. You who are not fit to judge, you earn nothing.
I only do it when it&apos;s necessary, and it was necessary back there. He wanted me to kill someone. I didn&apos;t want to kill them. Being a little impolite seemed the least bad option...
*Wonder what he will do next.*
Magisters
Just get us something to drink!
Plague
Ah, if it isn&apos;t the rotting carcass who&apos;s going to save Rivellon...
Ripped Shirt
At last... thank you.
Fleetfooted
A bit of old-fashioned carnage from the looks of it. And we missed it.
I see a bloody past, an uncertain future. I see the glory of the Order. The one who locks us here. He who would be Divine... and you alone to claw him down from the throne.
Next time, please use the front door. Sneaking is rude.
Keep your hands to yourself. I don&apos;t warn you again.

Chandelier
Anti-Bovine Potion
*Bless him. Speak the spell immediately.*
And in fact... *Inhales deeply* I think I smell something I want. Something quite... delicious... Almost smells like a Magister I once knew. One I never could convince to visit me here...
I teach you to take what isn&apos;t yours!
Helmet Drop
Your curiosity has already caused enough suffering, Fane. Yes, I know who you are. You&apos;ll have time to figure it out when the darkness comes for you once again.
*Her eyes flutter open and dart around in a panic. They come to a focus on you.*
My thanks!
the dwarves were ill-prepared.
Traits
Nothing like watermelon for a taste of summer... and a mouthful of bees.
I am sorry. The Magisters deserve what they get. You do not.
*The boat has no means of propulsion. No oars or rowlocks, no pole, no paddles. And this doesn&apos;t look like the kind of creek you&apos;d like to be up without one.*
You&apos;ll see. We&apos;re gonna help you.
The island of Fort Joy, the old redoubt of the Source King Braccus Rex, was turned over to the people of Driftwood to use as they wished. They turned it into a holiday resort.
*Meet his eyes.*
Does this place feel a little... &lt;i&gt;tight&lt;/i&gt; to you? Like a two-quart sack stuffed with four quarts of taters?
Heavy Ring
Enemies who move in your aura will be charmed.
If you&apos;re looking for Magister Reimond, you&apos;re too late. He&apos;s a dot on the horizon now. Shark fare for all I care...
It is a room of many levers. Five will lead you closer to your goal - the rest will lead you to your death.
But there is merit to my madness. Can you say the same of your mania?
You are worse than Sallow!
Not that I&apos;m ungrateful. I don&apos;t know what I would do without my people.
*A memory returns - a sacrifice at an altar on the island. Duna smiles, and rolls his shoulders as if stretching... then seems to &lt;i&gt;grow.*&lt;/i&gt;
Heeheehee. I bet a troll would eat a whole you! Everybody out! Troll dinnertime!
But then a fellow pilgrim passed by; laid his hands upon my feverish skin, and just like that, I was cured! Truly it was a miracle!
Cottontail
This land is so much more than a wasteland to explore; its people more than specimens to be studied. My life is more than my obsessions. At least, with you it could be.
[OUTLAW] *Say that life&apos;s easier when you hold no expectations at all.*
Trader Jemason
*Decline; tell Ifan that you don&apos;t drink.*
*He shakes his head and whistles as he identifies the Doctor&apos;s home on your map.*
*The White Magister yanks her head towards the hanging man and snickers.*
I may have been freed from the Covenant,
I&apos;ve warned you already, smartmouth - clear out of here!
&lt;i&gt;Roost Anlon must pay!&lt;/i&gt;
I left the back of my hand in a tomb millennia ago. And much of my memory with it.
When I decided to run away from the Mother Tree with only the moon for my guide it was a terrible journey.
Living Wall
The Doctor prefers that you die.
Please - I&apos;m sorry. I had to, I had to...
*Proclaim that the Veil is the single greatest discovery in history. It seems to hide unimaginable power.*
*Ask why Gareth is so important to Leya.*
*You start to speak, but it&apos;s too late. Amadia breaks free, and the voice that emerges from your mouth is not quite your own.*
And they threw it away.
*Tell him you have it on the authority of someone glad he&apos;s still alive.*
The time has come, my stitched-lipped lovelies! We set sail! Get on board and man your stations!
I&apos;m impressed, chief. Sounds like no small feat.
You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;, but that would close the portal for good. It isn&apos;t nothing for me to bring us here. It takes a great sacrifice.&lt;i&gt; Don&apos;t waste it.&lt;/i&gt;
[MYSTIC] *Search his eyes. Search his heart. Search his &lt;i&gt;soul.&lt;/i&gt; What turned this man into a killer?*
At the start of combat, a random enemy will be marked. Killing the target heals you and resets all cooldowns.
*Duna smiles and you notice for the first time two vampire-like fangs glistening beneath his upper lip. A gulf of magic envelops you, and you feel a sudden insatiable hunger for Source.*
He knows very well I&apos;m the best in the business. Asked me to value his collection personally!
You. I trusted you, and you betrayed me.
You were crafted as an act of ego, but one can hardly hold that against the creatures. In truth, the lords never troubled themselves with too much imagination.
*The beast chews thoughtfully.*
Lohar is dead. An appropriate fate for Queen Justinia&apos;s lackey.
*He returns to your arms and begins to peel away your clothing until you feel only skin against skin - save his beard, of course, which tickles your face, your chest, your belly, as his kisses slowly move downward.*
*Gareth pulls away, and his face reddens again. His jaws clench so tightly that his lips purse outwards into a frightful sneer. His voice is a whip, threatening to punish anyone or anything that draws too near.*
A true, flesh and blood elf might. I cannot say what fortune the likes of you would have.
[The page is split into three columns. In the leftmost column is a series of words in an unfamiliar language. In the middle common is a series of common words. In the right column are numbers.]
*He takes you by one manicured hand. With the other, he reaches for your face - and discovers your truth. You are not living, nor dead. He pauses. He smiles.*
The old Lone Wolf assassin Ifan joined me in Fort Joy. He has business here. I should ask him about it.
Source Orb
Who knows what power such a relic might hold!
Open the vaults.
Self-pity is as dangerous as any man I have battled, Alexandar included. In this new world, this world without the Seven Gods, with Divinity shared between light and dark, it&apos;s a foe I plan to defeat for good.
If you don&apos;t already know the answer to that, I reckon you don&apos;t have much to tell me.
We decided not to travel to the demon&apos;s home plane. We&apos;ll face him as he is.
*Their &apos;promise&apos;? Demand to know what she&apos;s talking about.*
What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; this place?
I don&apos;t like the look of him, so I&apos;m afraid his time has come.
You. With the friend who&apos;s actually worth my time.
And? Out with it.
