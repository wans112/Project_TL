Haunted quagmires is what they are, and what is mired in them is madness. Braccus Rex: he went too far. Source was never meant to be harnessed in weaponry.
Don&apos;t play coy. I&apos;ve no doubt you kill for fun - if for no other reason, because you &lt;i&gt;can. &lt;/i&gt;One needs no better reason than that. But I can give you a reason.
*As soon as your fingertips trace these mutilated runes, your eyes flicker closed of their own accord. You see... &lt;i&gt;nothingness&lt;/i&gt;: vast, dark and empty.*
*The tallest, strongest elf, whom you take to be the leader, acknowledges your presence with the tiniest tilt of her head, then turns back to the task in hand.*
It&apos;s okay to say you don&apos;t know. You don&apos;t have to make stuff up.
You are kind... but I can never be free again, not truly. I am a vessel, and must be guided. Let me take you wherever you wish. We can depart as soon as you are ready.
Livy was no child of Lovrik&apos;s.
As a matter of fact: yes.
There&apos;s nothing of value here for me.
*You were a tough dwarven smith of great experience and talent. You wanted to make a name for yourself, but you ran out of time.*
Dead Magister Priest
House of War Apprentice Bracers
*Argue that the Seven keep the Void at bay. She should be fighting it, not talking to you.*
This is no time to stop for a conversation - more of these creatures could be nearby.
The island&apos;s archives may hold the key to talking with the Ancestor Tree.
I supported my friend and they claimed Divinity. All the luck and love in the world to them. They&apos;ll need it.
Yes, I know how they work, visitors like yours.
[SOLDIER] *Their patrols are good, but not airtight. You can see at least three exfiltration points from here.*
Sourcerer! I &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; you were all harbingers of the Void!
*Reach for your weapon. Say you wanted some easy target practice.*
Looking fresh from some hellish abattoir, it&apos;s hard to imagine that this dismembered torso was once part of a walking, talking, thinking being. Just like you.
*The bottle swishes in circles as it spins; Lohse watches intently as it lands pointing directly at her. She smiles and blushes.*
*Narrow your eyes and tell Han you like to keep your business to yourself.*
No can do.
The ritual itself is quite simple: drop some blackroot in the bowl, mix in a little blood, set the concoction aflame, and then... well, not &apos;inhale&apos; the smoke, but whatever the skeletal equivalent is.
This has gone even better than I&apos;d planned.
Truly a pity, that you weren&apos;t willing to play nice...
Voices. The wisdom of elven ascendants.&lt;br&gt;An... ancestor tree!
*You&apos;re curious - what will this mean for the rest of the Seven?*
We&apos;ve discovered the Captain&apos;s Hideaway. The wreck of a ship is inside, but an ill-tempered door stopped us from investigating.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her that to even contemplate such a pernicious assault is to venture head-first into the most repellent realm that is utter immorality.*
Red Prince&apos;s Blood Vial

Chief amongst her opponents was Tovah - Saheila&apos;s own mother.
Maybe... maybe I chose wrong. Maybe now I&apos;ll never be rid of him. Maybe now &lt;i&gt;no-one &lt;/i&gt;will ever be rid of him...
Defeat Lucian, Dallis, and Braccus.
You&apos;ve discovered [1] new chronicles.
Now then. On a more serious note. Why didn&apos;t you hug me?
I hate goodbyes.
*Insist he drop his weapon and set this Sourcerer free.*
*Tell her you&apos;re a grown-up and she really needs to do what she&apos;s told.*
Ave Layal
Betty the turtle lives a sad and lonely life in Ryker&apos;s cellar.
Bock-bock! BOCK! B-o-o-o-ck
Prepare to face justice for your crimes!
Suit yourself.
Spirit of the Dreamer
*The spirit is silent no longer. His smile turns to laughter, so hearty you&apos;re sure that even the ungifted might hear.*
It burdens my heart, truly, but I must say farewell now. Take this - a good reward for good decisions.
*Say you wouldn&apos;t mind an audience with the lady of the house.*
Queen Justinia intends to release the Deathfog in Arx - a first decisive blow in a war with the Divine Order.
*Leave the spirit to its fate, whatever that may be.*
*He bows his head in silent tribute and begins to mumble a prayer.*
Don&apos;t keep him waiting! Jahan may be immortal, but that doesn&apos;t make him particularly patient.
I care for you, lass. I do. But this is your last warning.
To accept Divinity is to accept responsibility for the lives of every person and beast that walks Rivellon.
*You see him sitting beside a campfire in the night, whispering as in response to an unseen voice.*
I was not ruthless enough to be Divine. I could not earn entry to the Council&apos;s great academy. But I may serve those who may, if they serve Tir-Cendelius. How can I help you?
Our finest pupil paid a visit - Lucian the Divine himself. We feasted with him. He raised a toast to his old teachers...
*Ask if he&apos;s stranded here with the others.*
No... no...
You did your best, I can ask no more.
The ritual took me to the Hall of Echoes, where my god took refuge from the Void within my soul.
*Admit that you&apos;re not sure.*
Delete
Crate
There. It&apos;s done. Let&apos;s... let&apos;s keep moving.
*With a nod of respect she turns to leave.*
Reality Tear
Your Honour! I beg your pardon - she must have slipped her watchman.
*Griff counts your coins with greedy fingers.*
Dungeon - Many Doors
Once you have, return to me here.
You wolves are known for getting out of traps one way or another, right?
You&apos;re no better than they -
Nameless Statue
*Nod. You&apos;re convinced. Where can you find this Well of Ascension?*
*Decide that they did the right thing, even if it was for selfish reasons.*
You want to enter Lucian&apos;s Tomb, don&apos;t you?
So feed, my sweet, for you will starve until you finally feast upon the Well of Ascension.
[JESTER] *Say you&apos;re sorry, but you&apos;re only here for play time with your little friend.*
Ladder is blocked
If we have not yet reached our potential, we may develop our Source powers in the Academy library.
*Say she can call you whatever she wants.*
Look at this. Just &lt;i&gt;look at this! &lt;/i&gt;Our barracks RANSACKED by our own brothers-in-arms! And my sworn Magister comrades - MURDERED by them!
Mari&apos;s Hatch Key
*Her pupils narrow.*
...there is the terrible justice of the Path of Blood. Gruesome, perhaps. Demanding, definitely. But those who take the path demonstrate the truest of true faith. Their purity will surely be rewarded. As will yours.
Playing Dead
Lucio
Pizza
Spiders crawl from the filthy straw of this broom; no clean sweep here.
We left the Nameless Isle without fulfilling the Watcher&apos;s request.
Hope you find something useful...
Martyred Monk
Potion Of Jellyfish Skin
Primitive Axe
*Say you&apos;ve had a good life. You did what you loved, and people loved you for it.*
*Ask the crab what it&apos;s doing out here.*
We found Gwydian hanging from a gibbet, being interrogated by a White Magister.
*Say that you remember Harina the Eternal - not... whatever she is now.*
*The squirrel&apos;s mouth is too full to speak to you. And it shows no sign of changing that.*
*Tell the Red Prince that there is no time for chit-chat now.*
[BEAST] *Chuckle. Has she got a tap and a barrel of ale back there?*
*His eyebrow arches as he takes in your undead visage, exposed for all to see.*
Beach - Demonic Shipwreck
I&apos;ll take my things back. But I&apos;m not just going to let this go.
Hmm. No voices to complain, no demons to stop me. Let&apos;s hope it stays that way.
Business doesn&apos;t stop for long &apos;round here.
Alien Shadow Essence
Don&apos;t do it anywhere near me! I never want to see him again, in &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;life!
I think it&apos;s just your &lt;i&gt;head &lt;/i&gt;she wants, bud.
Clear current order

Oh, so sorry for any confusion. It&apos;s a pay-per-use deal. My children have to eat, you know. Or would, if I had any. Which I could!
Bold
Come on, throw it...
You&apos;re funny and I like you. You can have this. I found it outside but I can&apos;t read it yet. That&apos;s next year, and then I&apos;ll learn it.
Show some responsibility. Surrender your Source.
[UNDEAD] *Tell her that you&apos;re just someone whose rest has been disturbed.*
I have too much to carry
Firebrand
&lt;i&gt;Adventure&lt;/i&gt; is precisely what my life was missing.
Proceed forward, Godwoken. We don&apos;t have forever to bob here like dead ducks. The Order is coming for you, and I might let them have you if you do anything foolish.
*Explain that you were sealed away, just like her. You are not responsible for whatever happened to your people.*
The missus&apos;ll kill me. She&apos;ll tear me a new mouth half-way down me neck.
*Relent. Of course you won&apos;t deny her.*
She murdered countless innocents: women, children, families, towns. Her blood ran colder than mine...
Said it was our reward for services rendered. Eternity on an island &apos;aradise. Also &apos;eing dead we couldn&apos;t give away anything a&apos;out the gargoyle &apos;aze. La&apos;yrinth.
*Go. Don&apos;t look back.*
*Tell her she doesn&apos;t look like she&apos;s in a state to storm anything but the floor.*
*Gareth is still. For a moment, his mind wanders to memories of friends and enemies, of Malady and Magisters, of demons and Divinity. He is then present once more, but he remains standing.*
*Remark that the Magisters seem to believe that the Aeteran is real - they&apos;ve been looking for it, in fact.*
Rogue Voice
Well, your bag is clean.
[1] wants to make peace with you.&lt;br&gt;Do you want to accept?
Sign back in
After your communiqu√©, he instigated investigations into every Magister in the city.
*The spirit looks to you, confused.*
*An executioner&apos;s blade hovers inches above a young woman&apos;s throat. The nearby Magister drones a prayer with all the passion of a silent monk&apos;s empty gaze.*
Cave - Skull Head
To cut a delicate path through a dangerous area, toggle into sneak mode and zoom in using [RightStickY].
That sounds like the talk of someone unaccustomed to victory.
Killing Arx makes the dwarves the enemies of most of the rest of the world. That&apos;s some fine diplomacy right there, Justinia.
This is an island of many mysteries, of many horrors. I&apos;ll learn what I can; perhaps there is some possible reprieve for the souls who suffer here.
You&apos;re... probably right. And there&apos;s nothing left for me here. For anyone.
Me too. I would&apos;ve made an awful Silent Monk. A Lohse must SING, and that&apos;s that.
Explosives
Someone stronger than me needs to become the next Divine of Rivellon. I think you have what it takes. I will do everything I can to support you.
*Tell her that the Magisters know she&apos;s involved the disappearances - you&apos;re here to bring her in.*
*Tell the spirit that you ate his remains.*
Hah, no - quite the opposite in fact. I am more alive than ever. I walk in my father&apos;s footsteps, and soon I shall become the Divine.
You&apos;d best go, before I change I mind about those bones of yours.
&apos;tis ignoble, to wish forrr death but ask it frrrom anotherrr&apos;s hand.
Let your tomb be your final prison!
You&apos;ll find it easier to corner Alexandar out here, and this delicious little morsel called &lt;i&gt;Shadow&apos;s Eye&lt;/i&gt; should help you send him to his rightful place beside his father in the Hall of Echoes...
Meet Gawin.
*Ask the laughing alchemist to trade.*
&lt;br&gt;W H E N&lt;br&gt;T H E&lt;br&gt;G O D&lt;br&gt;K I N G&lt;br&gt;R U L E S . . .
*Ask the dwarf if he could help you out.*
And? Any indication of Dallis&apos; plans?
