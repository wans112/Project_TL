With Jahan, I&apos;ll travel to Arx and hunt down the demon.
*Laugh.*
The final spell. The last thing our friend here will need to defeat their foes. Now we just need to finish our own research if we are to fend off the Great Acorn.

Summon Poison Ooze
The flames mustn&apos;t be kindled!
Hush now, sweetling. Stress makes it easier for them.
And why would I be telling a little stranger like you about it?
Bejewelled is he with a false name... Draped is his back with a false mantle... Bedecked are his cheeks with a false beard...
Liam&apos;s Stash
Sophisticated
*The spirit is made up of nothing but pain and the fear that it&apos;ll never end.*
*...and the air goes suddenly, eerily still - then breaks, a flash of heat hitting your face like fire.*

*He leaps to attention and brandishes his blade.*
*The dwarf&apos;s full attention is on the fish once more, muttering inaudible observations to himself.*
*He searches your veiled face for the lie. Doesn&apos;t find it in the darkness there. The compliment touches him. He smiles. Reaches for you...*
Hmmm... As you were forced unto this ship in the dead of night, you walked the length of the hull, running your hand along the timber as if it were a woman&apos;s thighs.
Finally. Somewhere nice.
This island was once a place of learning, of healing. We were Rivellon&apos;s sword and shield against the demons who preyed upon the weak.
Visitor&apos;s Book
Hmm. I see. I wish you well. Keep safe.
*Look to the horizon. You haven&apos;t given up the fight yet. It&apos;s not over.*
I told you already - leave me to my duty.
You saved us! We were going to die for sure, &lt;i&gt;thank you!&lt;/i&gt;
Jungle Dark
We found an unusual talking gem.
Won&apos;t find nothing better than a Gheist, not in yer life. But I don&apos;t picture you with Gheist companions, oh no. I picture you rather of the Gheistly type yerself. He-he.
*You&apos;re lost in reverie and see what she sees - an idyll: this corner of land as it was hundreds of years ago, when only seagulls dwelt upon these cliffs. Warm breezes carry petals and pollen to destinations unknown.*
Daggers Drawn Skillbook
I must have breathed in some of that Deathfog. My lungs ache, a-and I can&apos;t see straight!
*The arm&apos;s every joint snaps rigidly into place. It points into the distance like a compass needle.*
The Red Prince never met Brahmos.

Toggle Ai Grid
*Wonder how she ended up in this prison.*
Hush! The ancestor &lt;i&gt;speaks.&lt;/i&gt;
Please, Godwoken. Go.
That&apos;s for me to know and you to get out of my face. Buy or shove off.

[DWARF] *Express surprise that she&apos;d show interest in a dwarf.*
*Karon blinks once. Twice. Then - the ocean of anger evaporates. The nugget of fear appears in the palm of his hand. He stares at it. Turns it this way and that. Then he closes his hand over it and squeezes.*
*Tell her that whatever comes next, you can do it without her help.*
*Catching himself mid-speech, he suddenly turns to glower at you, beady eyes bright with hostility.*
*Ask if it is not better to dream of a better world than to accept a painful reality.*
[VILLAIN] *Keep the ring and walk away.*
The important thing is the magic in your soul, not the wand itself. Just keep telling yourself that.
Vrogir&apos;s rage burns like the Sun.
I &lt;i&gt;hunger&lt;/i&gt; for you. There&apos;s no stopping me now.
*Take your leave.*
Harvested from the rarest sea snails, this is a dye fit for kings.
*Your deal? You&apos;re just trying to survive.*
Are you trying to trick me? I am not a fool, you juicy little morsel.
&lt;i&gt;I do not expect you to approve of my means. Only the ends.&lt;/i&gt;
Thom Hardwin died. He never saw his Paladin comrade avenged.
*Say you understand; the Void is coming. But there must be another way...*
[MYSTIC] *Hold a bare hand to the cool air a minute. Then lay a palm upon her cheek.*
Defend me or die!
Quit it!
You&apos;re nice. And I&apos;m a good dog. Yes I am!
A mystery&apos;s a mystery.
*Explain that you&apos;re here to learn from Ryker.*
You barge in uninvited, only to offer a goodbye? Shameful.
*Tir-Cendelius smiles and you notice for the first time two vampire-like fangs glistening beneath his upper lip. A gulf of magic envelops you, and you feel a sudden insatiable hunger for Source.*
*Yank the arm out from between the rocks.*
*He opens his mouth as if to meow, but makes no sound.*
*...and the machine winds down. The cistern is empty. All is silent.*
*The girl&apos;s eyes start to clear... and this time they &lt;i&gt;stay clear.*&lt;/i&gt;
The only thing you&apos;re buying from me is your own grave, fool.
*You realise that her hand is caressing your arm. She gazes at you intently, untroubled by the feel of your undead physique. Her eyes are oceans of violet. You could get lost in them.*
*His quill scribbles furiously upon the scroll before him.*
Once, I plan to reunite our people. But the Ancestor shows me.
Ragged Boots
A Lizard Nightmare
Almost like meeting an old friend.
A vibrant and robust species, this mushroom is a prized ingredient of fire alchemists.
Find Dorian Gall.
Of course when I say pleasure, I mean the &lt;i&gt;distinct&lt;/i&gt; dishonour.
*The dragon&apos;s black eyes turn red with rage. It lashes out, all fire and fury.*
Chances are I wouldn&apos;t have survived the shipwreck, had you not returned to the aid of your fellow passengers down in that dreadful hold.

Warden Yona
Amadia&apos;s accursed waters killed the pig.
*In the flickering torchlight you see a Magister lying muttering on the ground. As you approach, he turns with a jerk.*
*She plants a giant, sloppy kiss on your cheek and takes your arm, all smiles.*
High Judge Orivand
It&apos;s just-... that thing you did with your tibia. It was... quite unexpected.
The clearer the target, the less chance for collateral damage I would think. So never you fret.
The cavern is full of Magisters. They must be after something important.
Although that does limit your choices somewhat. You may end up with quite a few sagging faces.
*Admit you entered Kemm&apos;s Vault.*
Candles
One of us paid Lovrik for an intimate liaison. Zharah will be waiting on the top floor...
Here&apos;s twenty or so noble gentlemen. No-one knows what they did wrong - if anything! And she has &apos;em stripped and whipped all the way to the execution grounds. Didn&apos;t even give &apos;em the dignity of the sword, no sir! Had &apos;em all hung. Reeeal slow like.
Creatures &amp; Items
Bucket
*Ask if Arhu has visited this house recently.*
We nabbed Mordus trying to pinch a Deathfog machine.
Thank you.
Door&apos;s open. Go on in.
*Brush her off. You&apos;d rather not talk about it.*
Now that she has your scent, it won&apos;t be long until Septa tracks you here and guts you like a minnow.
Eldritch Tombstone
But I&apos;ve done such terrible things.
All them queer folk go into the tavern, but I ain&apos;t never seen one leave! Ain&apos;t that just... queer?
[NOBLE] *Tell him he is wrong. There is nothing more noble than a righteous sacrifice.*
[VILLAIN] *Smile and state that you value your own personal achievement, no matter the cost.*
Remove item from hand
UNKNOWN
*Demur. Say you aren&apos;t sure you want to...*
It&apos;s not an ordinary location, I admit. But I prefer to be... &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt;ordinary. There is no pleasure in mediocrity. Don&apos;t you agree... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt;
It certainly makes travelling through towns easier...
Thanks, but no thanks.
So when your necromancers rebel? Kill them and bring them back so they never know the peace of the Hall of Echoes.
*Say you understand.*
*Denounce his self-pity. He&apos;s got Seekers to lead. Snap out of it!*
*Ask where you can find these Sourcerers.*
*Ifan shakes his head, smiling down at the ground.*
Pop... what did she do to you? Can you remember?
[RED PRINCE] *Tell her your home is a palace grander than any other.*
Help! Help!
Switch Inventory
Dallis? I... I don&apos;t know. I never spoke to the woman. Reimond was the one giving me orders - Reimond and the other Whites.
*The guard&apos;s eyebrows furrow and he makes a small motion with his head, suggesting you get out of the way. &lt;i&gt;Now.*&lt;/i&gt;
Crumpled Note
I do hope you are not here to try to kill me again. I think we need to talk.
*You recognise this spirit; it was in one of the candles in the demon&apos;s home plane.*
*He gestures dismissively over the great battle below, where god assaults god in ceaseless violence.*
Raedalus
Now. Where were we?
*The spirit is blind to you. He grips his sword tightly. Creeping fear slowly fills his dead eyes...*
Now... I smell... &lt;i&gt;SO MUCH&lt;/i&gt;... in that building over there...
*Tell her to open the gate - you want to find out if the prisoners know how to get this ship moving.*
There&apos;s no sanctuary here. I&apos;d like to help you, but I can&apos;t. Go back the way you came.
*The little rat squeaks up at you inquisitively, beady little eyes full of something approximating intelligence.*
*Uhhhhnnn...*
*Tell him you simply haven&apos;t the time for all this palavering.*
Highly interesting... and highly valuable. Perhaps even quite out of your league?
Paladin Male
Peace Of Mind
I&apos;m glad to have that bloody farmhouse behind me - I thought that place would become my grave.
*Tell her you can&apos;t smell anything but death here.*
*Tell him he has no reason to complain: he made it to shore, didn&apos;t he?*
*She seems to look right through you, her laughter ringing in the distance like fading cathedral bells.*
[SCHOLAR] *Say that trials should be open and public - there isn&apos;t a law text in existence that would recognise this farce.*
I didn&apos;t imagine again stepping foot on the Lady Vengeance. That she sails is a miracle. And I welcome each and every one.
Hah! Can you believe that load o&apos; crap? &lt;i&gt;Cure &lt;/i&gt;the Source inside ya? Be like curin&apos; the flawless sheen o&apos; me beard!
Well, really. I&apos;m quite aware of &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;
must make a roll
It&apos;s... nothing. It&apos;s...
Hah. I am fine. The question is: Are you? And how long does that last in a place like this?
The demon would see us dead.
*Ask to speak with Micheil Ros. Say Lohar sent you.*
*He casts another rueful look over the mounds of dead.*
*The spirit remains on the floor, staring upwards. Her eyes grow dim...*
Just as I thought. That explains what&apos;s besieging my nostrils.
&apos;raccus Rex, he used to test stuff on &apos;risoners in the fort. Wasn&apos;t nice, if you ask &apos;e. &apos;ut work is work.
I hardly think that necessary; the Path has been walked this day!
She... she disgusts me. What kind of person would knowingly craft something like that?
Hannag&apos;s a pretty powerful Source Master. Incredible control of portals - I&apos;ve never seen anyone bend space like she can.
I am not falling for that. You&apos;re under arrest!
