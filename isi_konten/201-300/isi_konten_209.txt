*You kiss Ifan once, an exploration. His lips are rough and his beard tickles. He tastes like red wine and salt.*
*Hand her the necklace you found on Gareth&apos;s body. He probably would have liked her to have it.*
The tigers fly, the leopards lie, and you... and you... Oh! But I know you, don&apos;t I? I have seen you in the night. Rudderless among the drowned... Just a dream, of course. Just a dream.
*ROAR!*
*Tell them you&apos;d like to know who it was you saved - of sorts.*
Chunk Of Flesh
*The spirit of Alexandar looks bitterly dejected. He turns to you.*
You know, you&apos;d never believe it. Lyn already knows. She turned to me not too long ago, her face smooth as a stone, and she squeezes my hand, and she goes &apos;Conway, our boy is gone.&apos; She felt it.
Fight Theme 06 Tambura
Many Ancestor Trees were lost in the Chaos Wars. More died in the Deathfog. Yet more have since been destroyed.
And so we&apos;ve fulfilled our destinies my prince. Our children will be dragons, though already their lives are in peril.
Spontaneous Combustion
*Reach out in concern. Is she okay?*
*Looking at the complex contraption in front of her, ask what she is doing here.*
*Take your leave.*
But now, I finally have revenge. Revenge on the Seven and the God King. Revenge for what they took from me. My Life. My people. My &lt;i&gt;mother...&lt;/i&gt;
[OUTLAW] *Say the creature&apos;s business is none of yours and turn your back.*
I hear every story, over and over again. Including that one! You&apos;re under arrest.
Just a barrel.
This is altogether too familiar...
[SEBILLE] *Offer the voice peace. As Prime Scion, it is within your power.*
Two-Handed Lucid Axe
*Grin. What game did she have in mind?*
I am here to serve, Mistress. In this realm and any other, for as long as I can.
A third altar and a third prayer. A voice, calm and even, told me that my burden was too great, and implored me to rest. Then it was gone.
*You sense a great whorl of energy within the jar.*
I saw Rivellon as the Void would have it. As nothingness. No mortal creatures, no plants, no life. Nothing but Source to be consumed by an insatiable hunger.
Fate of the Sworn
Light Gold Cup
*Shake your head. No, no it &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;be too late.*
*thrk*
*Ifan nods, and his eyes brighten. He looks different, somehow, as if the vestige of command has returned to this ex-soldier.*
*The first thing you notice is the figure&apos;s empty, eyeless sockets, so similar to your own. The second is that your senses feel... heightened. The third is that he is - or was - Black Ring.*
Who has not sinned? Not you, you say? &lt;i&gt;A sinner lies. &lt;/i&gt;Yet chances are when your turn comes you&apos;ll get your prayers while I did not.
*Ask him to repair your gear.*
Say! I don&apos;t know any Ancient Empire ditties. Got anything spicy enough to keep my mind off this place for a few bars?
Empyreo the Stalwart
*Flick your head towards the exit in the universally recognised sign for &apos;go on, git!&apos;*
Leave me be. I am preparing my soul for the trials ahead.
I reached my potential and sought the Council of Seven on the Nameless Isle. At the Well of Ascension I will claim my Divinity.
*Ask her if she&apos;s alright.*
*You &lt;i&gt;have &lt;/i&gt;to kill her now. Produce the dagger...*
Where is she? You go with us? Who &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;you? Are you from the Shelter? She says nothing of another. &lt;i&gt;Fyr-a las!&lt;/i&gt; She is so &lt;i&gt;late!&lt;/i&gt;
Don&apos;t you worry. With something like that inside you, he&apos;ll either come to you, or you&apos;ll be drawn to him soon enough.
Decomposing Cryomancer
Blazing Justice
*Yes! Say you&apos;re sure there will be.* &lt;br&gt;
She&apos;s insane.
Good morning, lovebirds - holy hells an Undead! Again, Zharah? Really?
*Note that she must be shocked to find herself tending to the Divine himself.*
This is your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/font&gt;! Everything you pick up is stored here. Press [IE_ContextMenu] on objects in your inventory to find out what you can do with them.
[NOBLE] *Raise your eyebrows to ask this obvious scumbag what he means.*
*Ask if she knows how the collars are made.*
Now as you&apos;re aware you&apos;ll be travelling with a prince. Proper forms of address include &apos;Your Majesty&apos;, &apos;Your Royal Highness&apos;, or if you&apos;re feeling particularly frivolous, &apos;Milord&apos;.
Hard to see unless you look at it out of the corner of your eye. It&apos;s as if this mushroom is desperately trying to go unnoticed.

Ravagers
You know, when our journey started, I was a man without a purpose. I lost it in the Deathfog. But now, after everything we&apos;ve been through together, I see what needs to be done.
|Four Sisters Quest|
Return to the spirit of Mudbarrow.
I&apos;m Mari. You?
*The warg growls louder, arches its neck, and opens its jaws around your arm.*
*Shake your head and say if it explodes now, it will fail its mission.*
We found the lich on Reaper&apos;s Bluffs, feasting on corpses.
[1] was turned into a pin-cushion.
Farmer&apos;s Note
Charlie said that the smelly man was a friend of Arhu&apos;s. She added that he used to smell old, but now he smells of rot.
Oasis
Is it a common thief I travel with? Sink any lower and you can scour for salvage.
*Drain her of her Source. Condemn her to the Void.*
*Say that he always carries it in his right hand.*
A vial of bone marrow labelled &apos;Fane&apos;
They ate me alive. The little ones - once they burst out of their eggs. They ate me screaming...
Some of that stuff&apos;s not bad, friend. It&apos;s a little bit better now &apos;f I say so meself. Good luck to yer.
Report back to Magister Borris.
Projectiles that hit you are reflected back at the caster. This does not prevent the original projectile effects. Provides [1].
One.
If a device breaks in a cave and nobody is around to complain... did I really break it?
Sourcerers that allowed their power to corrupt them. Many are wicked, cruel, vile, and generally not good teacher material, but we may have no others to turn to.
Please. I need to think and to pray. I need time.
*Shaking fingers fold into a crude gesture, one final insult before the bones go still.*
*The smell grows stronger. It closes in around you, creeping into your nostrils, through your lips...*
How... how bad is it?
This man, this Magister... his name is Jonathan. He&apos;s my friend. Or... &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; my friend.
I&apos;m wasted in this place - any fool can throw together a bloody stew.
There&apos;s a wonderful story behind that painting. But you will not hear it from me.
They send most of them away. And in wrong hands - &lt;i&gt;Magister&lt;/i&gt; hands...
Heaven&apos;s Blessing
[IFAN] *Tell her you&apos;re not exactly the praying kind.*
You will not run from your fate, Godtaint! And you are fated to rot.
*Ask why he wanted Sadha dead.*
Now we&apos;ll see what Kemm was hiding...
*Lohar wastes no time in fleeing as Beast looks on with a mix of irritation and amusement.*
*She warms you with a brief smile, and then leaves you with your thoughts, your beard - and your freedom.*
*Tarquin sighs and his lips unfreeze. For a moment, he looks almost... modest.*
*Sebille&apos;s spirit watches your approach like a spectator on a beach watches the waves roll in with a soothing inevitability.*
Badfingers
There&apos;s my good deed for the day!
Are you sure? At this... most sensitive hour?
Indomitable
In truth, I never dreamed I would have the opportunity amongst your kind, but - well, perhaps I was wrong.
&lt;i&gt;No it isn&apos;t!&lt;/i&gt;

The Teleporter
Oh, honey. Anathema is out there. And I&apos;m not keen on competition, if you get my drift.
*Inch away, afraid of it happening again; you still get nightmares...*
Ah, that scent! Unmistakeable. How did Noxious Bulbs end up &lt;i&gt;here?&lt;/i&gt;
*Inform him that you found a cache of Source weapons hidden in the fish factory.*
*Ask him for the password to his chest.*
*The rat gives you a long stare that tries - and fails - to say &apos;of course not&apos;.*
*Growl that there&apos;ll be none soon. The island&apos;s been overrun with Black Ring!*
Saving Arx? Who&apos;s got time for that?
I&apos;m being beaten at my own game here. But &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; yourself, lizards are the world&apos;s greatest lovers. And for a miniscule fee, I can direct you to the world&apos;s most talented lizard lover. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Do not reveal yourself here, Marcus. The guards won&apos;t know you unless you announce yourself. Your rebels braved the Hinterlands. They braved the Wavedancer. And now, they brave a poisoned court. They need you. &lt;i&gt;Alive.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask about this ruined nameless island.*
*Say that you want to know who the rat&apos;s mistress is first of all.*
*Eye the lingering bloodstains upon his hands and ask just what happened here before you go.*
After being trapped in this decimated ruin, a bit of sea air could be just what I need to relax. Decide what comes next. Thank you.
These fragments of livewood are tainted.
I&apos;ve heard of such portals. They&apos;re rare creations of the House of Dreams, leading to planes where dreams manifest as reality.
*The ghost leaps backward, but he can&apos;t stop his Source from funneling into you. He casts one last, desperate look at his remains, then vanishes.*
Sadha
*She gives you a pity pout.*
White Tea Leaves
No, no, no! My spirit is for the Halls, the Halls! &lt;i&gt;NO!&lt;/i&gt;
Voice Master
*What you were told hangs in the air like a noxious cloud. The Voidwoken were Eternals... robbed of their Source in order to create &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. They allied themselves with the Void so they could return.*
*Point out that with the Divine dead, your odds seem pretty good.*
Decide what to do with the man of the house.
There is... a waterway. A boat. Hand me your map - it isn&apos;t far.
&lt;i&gt;A champion I called. My champion did come. First among my chosen, first among them&lt;/i&gt;.
That&apos;s the way of the world. No point crying over it. We&apos;re &lt;i&gt;soldiers&lt;/i&gt;, damn it. So long as our own are fed and clothed and safe from the horrors of the Void, that&apos;s all we can do.
Not so fast, ben-Mezd. Just because I&apos;m smiling... it don&apos;t mean I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;happy&lt;/i&gt;.
Teleporter Pyramid
Well thanks, disembodied voice.
I&apos;m counting on you. Whatever&apos;s gone wrong there, I need it put right. We &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;do.
To have had the technology of the Eternals and made &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt; How crude. Although effective, in its own way...
That mode is available only with keyboard. Do you want to switch to keyboard mode?
*Smile and tell him you couldn&apos;t help but overhear some of the nuggets of wisdom he just received.*

Sneaky, oily, louse-ly kids dip in and out of here all the time. I ought to set out traps, see what I catch!

Some skill requirements are no longer valid; skill(s) have been unmemorised.
And if anyone goes near my mum I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll.. I&apos;ll bite its head off! Thank you, missus! You&apos;re a good person!&lt;br&gt;
He&apos;s back, by Lucian&apos;s teeth! Gareth&apos;s back! We might stand a fair chance of getting out of here after all!
Salamander Die
*Take your leave.*
&lt;i&gt;Dallis said you would come, old friend. You were always hard as diamonds, and twice as bright.&lt;/i&gt;
(Mabel, she can hear us whispering!)
No. No, I should not.
How does this work again? Erm... oh yes. Close your eyes. Repeat after me: &apos;Hallowed Seven, hear our prayer, we who erm... we who... worship at your altar...&apos;
*Take your leave.*
Lord Kemm does have a good eye for quality antiques, I must say!
Let us tread carefully. Slowly does it.
