*You cut him open with heart-pounding gusto. Stingtail&apos;s organs are birthed through the gaping wound and land with a wet splash.*

Sticky Letter
I&apos;d also appreciate it if we dealt with this Lohar fella. He&apos;s the key to unlocking this mess Justinia&apos;s made.
*Ask him if he&apos;s sure.*
That&apos;s fine, love. There&apos;s all the time in the world to try later, if you like.
Summon Hungry Flower
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you say.
And why would she do a thing like that?
That was rather fun, wasn&apos;t it? I do find it ever so invigorating to cut a cutthroat&apos;s throat.
*You&apos;ve made your point. Take your leave.*
Village Busy 02
I&apos;m so grateful for this news! I&apos;m going there now to seek Amadia&apos;s blessing. Thank you, thank you!
That&apos;s who the other Godwoken will meet in their own souls, by the by. Shrivelled, half-dead gods looking to steal Source from their chosen in exchange for the power to see spirits.
The stink of beer almost covers up the stink of fish...
*You spy some blood on the owl&apos;s beak, and some distension of his fluffy belly. You can&apos;t tell what killed him, but you&apos;re sure as sure can be that he&apos;s dead.*
*You take the dirt-flecked lamp out of your bag. It feels strangely warm in your hands.*
*Tell her it&apos;s okay. You don&apos;t really care about the painting.*
But do be a lamb and talk of sunshine things. Of sea breeze and sunflowers.
&lt;i&gt;The Divine does not absolve a traitor of his grace. You&apos;ve tended not to the seed the Seven have planted. Without faith, it cannot flourish...&lt;/i&gt;
The demon wars began. Rivellon was ravaged.
Magister Mace
*She closes her beady, black eyes and quietly accepts her fate.*
You... I... know... you...
Of all things, I wouldn&apos;t have thought my accent would give me away, but you&apos;re quite right of course!
*Brush her hand with yours and wink.*
*State that property is just property. Thank goodness no-one was hurt!*
*Demand he draw his weapon. Death is every Magister&apos;s rightful fate.*
Ha! He&apos;ll have to fight Dallis for the honour. Don&apos;t think she&apos;ll go down easy, either!
What I would give to have run that scum through myself. I hope you savoured the moment.
Come. We must retreat!
*Let them know that idle gossip is always a shame.*
*Shake her shoulder.*
*Ask what she thinks about that.*
*Smile wryly and say that &lt;i&gt;&apos;pilgrimage&apos; &lt;/i&gt;sounds rather ironic given your mission.*
Blank Earth Scroll
I do not need you to linger. I need you to... to help me save our people!
A malignance more rotten than any I&apos;ve known, brother. It should have been confined to the vaults. I&apos;d have offered myself up for the sacrifice, had I know the doctor&apos;s intentions.
I thank you for honouring Sarias. I thank you for nothing else.
Wh - what are you talking about? Of course it should go to his daughter, she- ...give me that!
Fortified
This poor unfortunate died just when he thought he was free.

*Ask where his interest in puppets came from.*

My king, return! Bring our people home!
Return what is ours.
I went looking for evidence of one crime, only to find evidence of another! You&apos;re under arrest, my friend.

We found the dead hero Garrick&apos;s treasure in the Stonegarden.

*Frown. What the hell is he talking about? Lucian can&apos;t help him now.*
*Dismiss him. Yeah, yeah. He&apos;s death.*
*The stone smells of granite and rosewater. Beneath the aroma a familiar smell lingers. But you can&apos;t place it...*
I... I... can&apos;t... I can&apos;t...
*Tell him the Magisters are dead, he&apos;s free to leave - but he should go unarmed.*
Lohse
*The Paladin sends arrow after arrow into the trees.*
Fly, my child. Fly!
*Tell him he sounds quite wise. Perhaps he can share some of his wisdom.*
The Meistr&apos;s instructions for the ritual are very specific. We must make sure we have all the necessary ingredients.
Hmm. Stay safe, then.
[HERO] *Frown and state that helping others gives your life value and meaning.*
*Say that there&apos;s no time to spare - if this figurehead is connected to whatever controls the ship, then you have to take a look.*
A succubus? Well, seems like you got what was comin&apos; to ya, but I won&apos;t harp on ya about it too much. Getting stuck with me is punishment enough! Heh.
Approach the Voidling chick.
Stop her!

I do love that in a woman...
Ah yes, Quercus, remember that? When it was too busy rushing to the seaside to listen to good council?
*Ask him what he&apos;s doing here.*
*The spirit of a dwarven lady remains rapt by the since-interrupted wedding ceremony. She dabs away some tears with a handkerchief.*
*Tell her she almost killed an innocent girl. You&apos;ll look at her however you please.*
Dispel Illusion
One way or another, they deserved it. Nobody is truly innocent.

No sign of Lucian&apos;s body!
My thanks. This is just what I need...
*Tell Gawin you&apos;ve already learned teleportation - let&apos;s get out of here!*
*Tell him your ship is made of livewood. Perhaps the lumber came from this very mill.*
My latest creation would have been especially gratifying. A device to kill your &apos;Gods&apos;. I even kept it close - in these very caverns.
Arrow Fire
Good; he&apos;ll have felt what we&apos;ve done - and he&apos;ll be looking for someone to hang.
*Ask if the queen might be freed from Isbeil&apos;s influence.*

My dear Lord Arhu, you should have told me to expect visitors! Oh, I &lt;i&gt;am &lt;/i&gt;sorry. Arhu, are you dead?
Steady on, love! Didn&apos;t mean no insult by it! Can&apos;t help but notice, is all.
Ha! Oh please, forgive my joculation. Leave? You shall not leave, sirrah.
*Leave his spirit in peace.*
I... I just found out something terrible. Something... something I did.
Humans, lizards, elves and dwarves all rallied to her banner.
I told the Seeker that the soulforged weapons of Braccus Rex remain hidden in a vault, but the Magisters recovered them before he could.
Decent of you to hear me out, stranger - can&apos;t say the same for most folk these days...
Fire Arrow
*Reach out and take the key. Basement. Stuff. Got it.*
Exactly. I&apos;m convinced that this tavern holds the key - it&apos;s full of scum and degenerates; the true culprit could easily hide amongst them.
Flaming Staff
That&apos;s settled then! You&apos;re very welcome to my House indeed. We&apos;ll feast and reminisce, but in the meantime...
*Your link to Jonathan is suddenly severed. His spirit stands before you, head bowed.*
His libido is legendary. How could he resist? And what better way to organise his demise? But of course I didn&apos;t know then he was Godwoken - stronger than the demon.
Huh huh huh...
INTRUDER! INTRUDER!
*Wonder what the likes of him could possibly do.*
*Consider the hideous figure. What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; this thing?*
Shite, it hurts so much.
Ser Vorr
Oh, for.. you&apos;ve got to be kidding me!
Blessed news! Now hurry, gather what you need and perform the ritual again.
*Tell him his people are no concern of yours.*
The Beast and the Lady Vengeance sail on.
*Say you&apos;d better get a move on, before the Order realises he&apos;s still at large.*
*Say that surely the average human - like you! - seeks fellowship, not fortune.*
*Ask about Braccus Rex. Why did he leave weapons here?*
Add a
That&apos;s pretty great, if you ask me!
*Ask the troll&apos;s spirit what he&apos;s doing here.*
To save the elves, Ifan brought them a &apos;portal&apos; that turned out to be a Deathfog bomb. He can&apos;t believe Lucian would have lied to him.
*After reading the scrap of paper he took from the Magister, Ifan marks a spot on your map and looks out to the far horizon.*
Magister Seal
Ingredient Trader
*Laugh as you recall him - funny fellow.*
*Say you must be or you wouldn&apos;t be here.*
My, my, lobster! How very presumptuous of you to ask anything of me. If there was a cave to explore, do you think I&apos;d tell &lt;i&gt;you?! &lt;/i&gt;I hear all kinds of rumours, you know. I know who you are.
Smile all you want, I&apos;m not in love with you.
Farmyard 02
Won&apos;t budge.
You would serve as both judge and executioner? Very well. Duna knows if my death is deserved, but he would not deny me a chance to defend myself!
*Tell him the Mother Tree is plotting against him. You have been sent to take his heart.*
Wait!
*Wave him forward.*
Hell if I know, but it don&apos;t sound good. Seems as though Mordus wasn&apos;t mine after all. Trouble is, I don&apos;t know whose he is.
Be &lt;i&gt;gone &lt;/i&gt;from me!
*As the little cat claws at Ifan&apos;s eyes, you are released. Turning, you see iridescent claws flashing towards Ifan&apos;s throat. Ifan bats the cat aside, and it thumps to your feet, dazed yet alive.*
A Divinity has ascended. Can ya believe it? Seems like we&apos;ve been adventurin&apos; forever minus a day.
I asked you for a man, not a note.
You say that now. But when Lady K glares you into next Tuesday, you&apos;ll regret keeping your hands clean.
I know it&apos;s probably not the answer you wanted. But I can&apos;t think of much else to say about it. Weird, right?
*You&apos;ll not play along. Remain silent.*
The Void itself is hunting down the gods, leeching us in ways we never thought possible. Droplet by droplet, we are being drained.
*Allow Beast to interject.*
*She found the painting in Lord Kemm&apos;s house. Ask &lt;i&gt;where,&lt;/i&gt; exactly.*
Beach Warm
*Gently reach out and hold his face, examining the deep, bloody wounds across his eyes.*
I can &lt;i&gt;HEAR&lt;/i&gt; it too... covered... with flies... my favourite... adds a bit of crunch.
Stop prowling around.
*Gareth&apos;s face reddens again. His jaws clench so tightly that his lips purse outwards into a frightful sneer. His voice is a whip, threatening to punish anyone or anything that draws too near.*
*A feeling of indescribable sadness assails you. It feels like your heart merges with the spirit&apos;s, torn together by a coil of thorns.*
Look at &apos;er, sister. A traitor of our own kind. Not fit to kiss the queen&apos;s bootsoles.
Of course... that&apos;s why I haven&apos;t heard from the cave. Sabotage.
You and I are the last Eternals Fane. That is why it will be us. That is why it &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;be us.
*You kiss, very tenderly. Next she takes your hands in hers; meets your eyes in earnest.*
Prisoner transport can get stuffed - I&apos;m asking for latrine duty.
*Tell her to go to hell.*
*Hesitate. What was that he was saying about an &lt;i&gt;errand?*&lt;/i&gt;
Connections? Where are your wires? Won&apos;t answer, will you? WHERE DOES THE YARROW GROW?! WHERE?! WHERE?! WHERE?!
*Hesitate. You haven&apos;t forgotten the reason you&apos;re here.*
Scourge of the skies, Slane the Winter Dragon can chill the blood and freeze the bones of his foes.
*Hold your ground. You are the head of this group, and you will speak to this creature.*
There should be no peace for someone who panders to power. We don&apos;t know what other sins he committed, after all.
And on the integrity of the elven Godwoken who did not ascend.
Please, no. No!
