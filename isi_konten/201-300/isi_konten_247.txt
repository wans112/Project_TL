Well, well, well. I go looking for signs of one crime, only to find evidence of another!
You still here, cheapskate?
*Vein in use*
*Jahan deeply inhales the sea air and smiles contently.*
[1] was kicked from the game
*You step up to the cell to look at Windego. She is inexplicably... alive, if unliving. This is more than necromancy.*
I sense your grief - and I do not wish to evoke memories you would rather not confront.
Thrifty
*Pulling his tunic over his head, you reveal Ifan&apos;s muscular body - all scars and sinew. He grins - &lt;i&gt;eager&lt;/i&gt; - pointed teeth parting, and embraces you so you are completely enveloped within his strong arms.*
I have Sworn my soul to the God King and his Covenant. When he desires, he will make his will known.
You would never forget Dorotya&apos;s kiss.

What&apos;s wrong, Godwoken? Did the Seven turn you down too? Or are you here seeking even &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;power?

Let&apos;s...
A scourge, a misery, a blight, a curse, a hex, a devil.

How much damage you can take before you die.
As for me... I was freed of the God King&apos;s terrible tyranny. I avoided an eternity of pain and suffering. Now I fight for the other side. Now I fight for the Divine!
Master died. But Master told me what to do. All my life, told me: &lt;i&gt;&apos;You are what you eat.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; So I do. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; will become the Master. Unless... you are not the new Master, are you?
Violent offenders like you get thrown in prison around here!
*A theatrical note in an ancient scrawl purports to explain the creation of a shapeshifting mask. First, it says, you must steal the face of another. Then you must power it with Source (an orb will do) to create a single face mask. Combining face masks of all four races with a Source orb will create a shapeshifting mask. Then you may walk in the world as another.*

Duna forgives. Divinity forgives. I&apos;m not so charitable.
*Tell the demon it doesn&apos;t own you. It&apos;s a parasite, nothing more.*
If we owe something to the people here - we owe it to &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;. Not to you. We&apos;ll thank you to take your leave now.
What care I of Braccus? Tell us, invasive flesh, does the harlot Gratiana share his bed still? Does she still serve his wicked desires?
I do not like to wait.
[BARBARIAN] *Laugh at his predicament. Tell him he looks like a toffee apple.*
Painting of a Knight
*Tell him you&apos;re a Sourcerer who wants to get the hell out of Fort Joy.*
*Let her song pass through you. Smile and ask if she&apos;s finished.*
[LIZARD] *Grimace at the corpse and say an elf never did anything for you, anyway.*
You have chosen the brighter path! I swear you will not fight alone.
*Apologise for intruding and tell them you&apos;ll make your own way out.*
*Look away; you don&apos;t intend to answer him.*
he took his place at the head of the demonic armies and became one of Adramahlihk&apos;s favourite generals.
*Beg her to tell you if you&apos;ll ever be free of it.*
Come here.
So, what should we do? Wait! Don&apos;t answer that.
*You are! Say that you can now store enough Source to proceed.*
*Ask what sort of cruelty you&apos;re supposed to undo.*
The water looks nice.
Applies Decaying, causing characters to take damage when healed.
*Turn and walk away.*
The open road, and a new life at the end of it, hopefully -
*Snap at the demon, saying that it must be a coward to hide within a child. Encourage the girl to resist.*
Creatures
*He holds the flagon out to you.*
What is this? This... No... no... no...
A very brave claim, made by many throughout the realm. And I&apos;ll see to it that they remain alive long enough to argue the point until we die of old age, warm in our beds.
Please, I told you all I know - leave me be, I beg you!
You&apos;ll need to master this power if you&apos;re going to make it off the island. And this you &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;do.
The heavy, gold-plated ring is stamped with the shape of a dragon. Its thinning band suggests it was worn frequently by its owner.
I could turn an anthill into a crater from a quarter-mile off. With both of us geared to the teeth, we&apos;ll make short work of these beasties. You ready or not?
*Demand he pledge his loyalty to the God King.*
Bear Mommy
*Turn to the Red Prince and ask if he is satisfied with what he was told.*
What a strange device...
[VILLAIN] *Tell him to give his nose another try. It&apos;s a predator he smelled.*
[An old nursery rhyme reads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come join me where it&apos;s hot,&lt;br&gt;Come join me at the fire,&lt;br&gt;Come join me &apos;round the pot.&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s how we make our dinner.]&lt;/i&gt;
We came across an odd, rune-inscribed tablet that seemed to glow from within. When we touched it, we felt tremendous energy flow through us. Somehow, we knew that the inscriptions were ancient Rivellonian. A phrase came to our mind&apos;s eye - &apos;One must rise&apos;. Then, the sensation passed. Clearly an ancient power lingers here.
Show some responsibility, Father. Surrender your Source.
*Cry out for her to let you go.*
I take it you realise, I&apos;ll not hold back if you stand in my way?
*Tell her you couldn&apos;t agree more.*

*Inside, you find not fish, but weapons. &lt;i&gt;Powerful &lt;/i&gt;weapons. The kind of weapons the Magisters took from the Hollow Marshes.*
Would&apos;ve been better fried with a little butter, but on the whole, not bad.
Oh no. Oh no you don&apos;t. A &apos;aster &apos;aze-&apos;uilder doesn&apos;t give away the king&apos;s secrets! &apos;y lihs are sealed. &apos;y lihs. I&apos;ll say nothing, is what I &apos;ean.
*Say you&apos;re looking for someone exceedingly subtle - the kind of person who could pick a pocket, then retreat to the shadows and throw a spell or two. A Shadowblade would do.*
I can help you with that. I can share my bond with the Source with you - fill your well to the brim, make you a master. The rest of the story - well - it&apos;s yours to write.
Shall I encourage you? Another piece of the armour sleeps in a garden of stone and death. Find it, and claim more power.
Do you feel the story motivates you to continue playing?
Think you&apos;re cute, do ye? Business is business; even the Magisters know that. Get shoppin&apos; or leave me be.

Isbeil&apos;s Notes
*Bid Arhu tell you about himself.*
You have friends. But they are few. Stay alert.

She was a Magister. Play with fire, expect to get burned.
*The woman traces glyphs in the air in a dramatic fashion. However, the only result is a bit of smoke sputtering forth. She cries to the skies in frustration in a recognisable rail-thin rasp.*
A standard forest mushroom, rumoured by elder Wayfarers to possess healing powers.
No!
Come. We&apos;ll be needed elsewhere.
*Demand she share her knowledge. You are Godwoken! You have earned it!*

Oh, do spare me!
*Ask what the lizard did to end up on the business end of his hammer.*
I&apos;m fine... I swear... see to the others...
To be restored we need the Source of the mortal races.
What can be done? How can my Order ever be redeemed after this?
*Say that you find it remarkable she seems to be so composed under such dire circumstances.*
We&apos;ve nothing to discuss.
You know it. Let&apos;s do this.
*Sigh* Thank the Seven.
Bloody godsdamned spit-sucking &lt;i&gt;weasel!&lt;/i&gt;
Schools Of Magic
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Oh hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That&apos;s brilliant, that is! Although...
Sadly, these pilgrims have no useful news. So off to the city I go; time to rid it of its demon.
A blood rose bush! When not in flower it barely stinks at all.
*As you approach the figure, your guise suddenly grows hot, unbearably hot, upon your skin.*
Hey, chief. Of course. We can go back up if you want. Or, if you want, we can keep playing.
Search Atmosphere
I think I&apos;ll stay off that particular device.
*He&apos;s right, you have what you came for. Time to go.*
*Say that you&apos;re no student, it&apos;s not night, and this &apos;gallery&apos; of his is little more than ashes and rubble.*
&lt;i&gt;I can hear her crying.&lt;/i&gt;
Sun-soaked grains baked with hatred into a poisoned loaf.
*Tell her you&apos;ll be right back, you need to help the other gods.*
How unfortunate. We could have been friends.
Alright! Alright. Your gear is downstairs. Talk to Lohar. For the love of the gods, don&apos;t mention my name.
I am not free. I belong to the Divine&apos;s son. And I am ready to die for him if I must.
*Tell her you don&apos;t think that&apos;s a good idea.*
*Shake your head and say your troubles are your own.*
Ahh, get out of here, will you? Y&apos;aint worth my time. &lt;i&gt;Neither&lt;/i&gt; of you.
Razzle Dazzle Grenade
We&apos;ll both need to do better in the future. We&apos;ve grown into one another. It feels more comfortable now. More natural. I don&apos;t need to seize control so often, and you don&apos;t need to persist so foolishly in trying to abandon me.
*She retrieves a small flask from her backpack, uncorks it, and takes a big swig.*
*You didn&apos;t come here to be insulted. Turn and walk away.*
The man survived his encounter with the Magisters. His home did not.
As his strength grew, so too did mine. There is &lt;i&gt;nothing &lt;/i&gt;you cannot do when you sit on the lap of a powerful king. And I did it all...
*Obnoxiously mention that you&apos;ve heard good things about the stew.*
Find and destroy the Mother Tree.
For the price of a kiss, Dorotya promised to fulfill my deepest desire.
Forget it! I don&apos;t want your money. I just want to see you pay!

I feel it. Source is near...

The very same!
You left us no choice. We had no other tools. We shall return, and then we shall cast out the Void.
Oh yes, oh yes, that&apos;s right, I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;so &lt;/i&gt;going to give you all the information you want, while you do nothing for me!
It looks as though our freedom cost &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;people dearly.
She&apos;s Black Ring! Black Ring and she&apos;ll gut you in a heartbeat! Oh gods, I&apos;m hit! Go on without me! Don&apos;t let her escape!
[OUTLAW] *Narrow your eyes. Not everyone that runs from authority is a murderer. Ask if they have any other evidence.*
The length of this mighty sword makes the risk of falling on it almost a physical impossibility.
