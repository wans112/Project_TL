But you shall see - you shall see the &lt;i&gt;power &lt;/i&gt;of my Lord.
My pleasure, guv! Hope you have a good time with the freak-folk in there!
Start Game
Drunkards, one and all, a rancid lot...
Zaleskar was killed before Sebille could learn more about the Lone Wolves. She&apos;ll have to look elsewhere.
How Braccus Rex came upon such horrible knowledge, I&apos;ll never know. His Source talents were great, but some of his skills and devices were... unfathomable.
Leave me alone, I&apos;m busy.
The Source Puppet mentioned that there are many levers which lead to death in the room where it came from, but only a few spell &apos;power&apos;. It told us that we must seek power in order to win freedom. What could it mean...?
What &lt;i&gt;isn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; to find intriguing? Let me read you my favourite part from &lt;i&gt;T Is For Troll. &lt;/i&gt;Ahem. And I quote:
*Lunge at the executioner. You&apos;ve seen enough.*
*She looks at you with wet eyes and manages a wink before returning to her work.*
I&apos;m going &lt;i&gt;nowhere&lt;/i&gt; right at this moment. Nowhere since &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; crossed my path and oh so very sharply piqued my interest.
Your style, I like it! So, how about a discount? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
The Shadow Prince is dead. At long last, the Master is gone.
*The Void managed to breach your soul?! What a violation...*
Yellow Ball
I will drink from your well!
*This gargoyle flares its lichenous nostrils as you draw near.*
Wraps
We seek the Sallow Man in his cavern lair. We should pass ourselves off as allies of the Black Ring.
We&apos;ve hauled a lot of bodies out to the graves today. More Divine Order brothers and sisters than I ever thought I&apos;d see in the ground.
Enter the portal.
I, eh, I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. Everything we have is on the shelves.
Complaining will get me nowhere, however. Not in... &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; state.
*Thank her for her vote of confidence. You won&apos;t fail her.*
Paddy here.
Portalmaster
My pleasure. And so we come to the second part of the plan. Follow through and I will endeavour what you desire most: the exorcism of your demon.
To save the elves, I brought them a &apos;portal&apos; that turned out to be a Deathfog bomb. Surely Lucian did not lie to me?
Ask Nebora to remove your Source collar.
Sure as Mama Morris died of a toilet spider! Only oversaw the place for dang near fifty years, after all.
Figured as much. So tell me: did you meet with a Magister caravan on your way into town? The hour&apos;s growing late and I&apos;m beginning to worry something might have gone wrong.
Intelligence: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
We killed Buttons the undead cat.
Perfect.
A hungry mind? Very well, let&apos;s find us something to feed it.
*The Magister accepts your hand and slowly stands while keeping his eye on you. His face remains a mask of fear and distrust.*
*As you turn away, some markings on a nearby barrel catches your eye. Walk over to investigate.*
I gave you a gift. Made you like one of the gods - a bit, anyway.
LOAD
Only Tovah can speak to you of this. She will decide what you should know or not.
I gotta say, I think we&apos;re onto something interesting here...
Let&apos;s not intimidate our guest further, Isbeil; I am yet too intrigued to give him leave. Why do you allow this man before me?
What... what are you doing? Leave them alone!
Flaming Tongues
Abstinence and chastity. That&apos;s what we learned in my home. That&apos;s what I taught my boy, Kniles. Abstinence and chastity.
*Keep your own sorrows quiet, but let her grief overcome you and weep for her children.*
*Tell him to head back to the Fort. You&apos;ll take over looking after the cart until more help comes.*
You&apos;ll remember her as she was, Jhad, the real her.
Grassy Pile
Ah. There may be some delay on the stew. The cook is somewhat disinclined to work the rest of her shift, on account of her being dead.
Streets littered with corpses. Never thought I&apos;d see the day.
&lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt;... you&apos;re not quite who you seem to be, are you? *Wink.* Our little secret...
...humankind establishes control.
*Sigh.* I suppose I have to kill you now.
*Ask for news of the Ancient Empire.*
Oh trust me... it&apos;s very lucky. The Magisters have these... other weapons... living, tortured weapons... I&apos;d rather have five arrows and a spear stuck in me than get hit by one of those things...
*Say you want to hear what he truly thought of Malady, now that she&apos;s dead.*
...Lucian&apos;s Day has come along!
Earthquake Scroll
Others seek the chest, but if you can rescue it from the flames and sing the words of that song, the chest will split open like an egg.
It won&apos;t be easy. You&apos;ll need to find tutors. Masters of the Source. People who can teach you to increase the volume of Source you can control.
*Try to lever the lid open with your fingers... or a blade... or whatever&apos;s handy.*
Now, give me your map. I&apos;ll show you just where to look. I doubt those beasts out there have any use of such cargo.
&apos;To Arx&apos;.
*No wax pools at the candle&apos;s wick, though it grows brighter as you inspect it.  A feeling comes over you - there&apos;s a soul within this flame, within the black wax that fuels it.*
*If he&apos;s insulted, he hides it remarkably well.*
Search Kemm&apos;s garden.
Ornamental Pet Urn
Traitor!
A leather cuirass with a red cape attached to it.
We have this place under lockdown. What makes you think he has escaped?
The plan is simple: we silence those dastardly Shriekers with a Purging Wand, then move to our transport and take the Lady Vengeance as our own.
*Lower your head. You were personal witness to the torture Kemm wrought on Arhu.*
You can&apos;t fight darkness with darkness - you just can&apos;t. Whatever she intended, the end result will be more death and destruction.
He is. He&apos;ll be glad to see you, too. Glad as Roost gets, anyway.
Truly? How intriguing. To hear a voice whilst drowning is a rather specific delusion to share, is it not?
*Say you understand it perfectly.*
*You recall great powers building inside you, the ones you commanded before your capture. Unleash them!*
*Ask if she can tell you what she and her friend are doing here.*
[SCHOLAR] *Quote the late Divine. &apos;You cleanse evil with every righteous blow.&apos;*
Incandescent Sniper
Thanks very &apos;uch. That&apos;s &apos;etter. &apos;uch &apos;etter. &apos;ut that doesn&apos;t &apos;ean you can o&apos;en the chest, &apos;cause you can&apos;t.
Jahan knows the arch-demon Adramahlihk possesses a Doctor Daeva in Arx - he must be confronted.
Thanks. I&apos;ll turn the other cheek this time. But don&apos;t go causing more trouble.
And don&apos;t even &lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt; with me this time. The price is the price.
You have worked miracles, Simone!
*Ask if he knows why you&apos;re here, Operation Downfall aside.*
Ha. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;.
Preference is of no consequence, Master. I am here to serve.
You&apos;re sure you&apos;re with Lohar?
[1]&apos;S TURN
The clouds should twinkle, as Lucian commanded them. Come, fireflies. He calls us elsewhere.
Old Trousers
*You do, but you do long for companionship.*
An Oil-Stained Key
Do whatever you want. What does it matter?
I wonder shall we see success on the Path of Blood today.
*She takes you by one manicured hand. With the other, she reaches for your face - and discovers your truth. You are not living, nor dead. She pauses. She smiles.*
...ssssssssssss... I forget.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast at last, bound for the Nameless Isle.
We&apos;ve returned the chestpiece to Daeyena. She plans to venture to Arx and retrieve the remaining spores.
Use to consume. Drinks nourish you and can have different effects on your character.
But mind - make sure you do get it to Arx, right? You don&apos;t want the Divine Order after you.
Always was a sucker for tall &apos;n&apos; handsome myself. Never seen a red one o&apos; your kind, but I&apos;m a humble country doc. Anyhow, a potion won&apos;t do ya harm, now will it?
Rotten Eggs
Here. This is a land of thieves - but coin is nothing.&lt;br&gt;
*His gaze rests upon you for a moment... then moves on.*
Ahhhhh, drown the ol&apos; hartch!
Memory affects your amount of Memory Slots, which are required to learn skills. More powerful skills cost more Memory Slots.
*You saw the chest burning in the flames. Ask how you open it.*
*Ask what more he knows about Bishop Alexandar and Dallis.*
Keep her name outta your mouth, how &apos;bout.
*Allow your keen mind to touch on his. Let them resonate together.*
&lt;br&gt;Base Boost: [1]%
I haven&apos;t even nibbled you yet.
[SOLDIER] *The dwarf queen&apos;s armies are some of the bravest around. Say that it&apos;s sad to see a dwarf cowering in a hole.*
All the better. I could do with a bit more sport before we&apos;re done with these idiots.
This and that! Your feedback on a few topics would be highly appreciated.
I stay. Lucian is just above, on the sun-bridges. I commune with him here and only here.
*A well-dressed dwarf paces swiftly around the room, overseeing the packing of trunks. He gives you a cursory glance, worry etched on his face.*&lt;font color=rgb(34,34,34)&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
Malady told us that we are indeed Godwoken - just the types that the Seekers are supposed to be helping. It seems that our journey will continue in their company for some time.
You know the way of things, Agbak. Travel to the Nameless Isle and seek the flaming arrowheads. They are our marks, the marks of the Devourer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow them to the sacred cave and offer your fire rune to the dragon’s mouth. You must undertake this alone, for only those who survive are granted our master’s blessing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May the Empress’ protection be upon you, my son. I have faith in you.
The fish you ate is known as the umber monkfish; a remarkably intelligent breed - in fact, its flesh is often used to create intelligence mixtures.
Now, back to your duties. There is much to do.
I know it isn&apos;t easy. But I&apos;ll help: Just say the word and I&apos;ll summon a flood large enough to end this - all of this - once and for all.
Necromancer Gwick&apos;s Soul Jar
A job. A job for the queen. Now get your ugly mug away from me.
[FANE] *You falter on seeing the undead. They look like they&apos;ve been locked down here for centuries...*
But there&apos;s always room for improvement. Say the word, and I will do what I can to bolster your strength even further.
You deserved better from your queen. So did the kingdom.
*Report that you&apos;ve found a cache of Source weapons in the basement.*
What a pity. I do hope you will return soon, so we might compare notes!
Blessed Divine, Merciful Seven... grant me another chance. Please, &lt;i&gt;I beg you!&lt;/i&gt;
*Push the needle deeper, until it begins to pierce his tongue. Then twist it.*
We thought it&apos;d be simple, but... Voidwoken, Undead, Seekers, and now this. We were doomed from the start. Dallis must&apos;ve known...
*M-O-o-O-o-O!*
Too many things have gone wrong along Reaper&apos;s Coast to attribute to bad luck: Magister ships sinking; weapons disappearing; a caravan gone missing.
*You hear a wondrous sound - that of a merciful blade slicing downward through the air. The pain ends, and darkness envelopes you.*
Motivate an allied character with the power of rage. Target allied character is guaranteed to land critical hits with basic attacks and weapon skills, but is muted. Clears Taunted, Terrified, Charmed and Clear-Minded statuses.
Orc Priest
Sebille. Your actions cause great pain to the Mother. You cause great pain to all elves when you run from duty.  You cause great pain to yourself.
*Ghostly sobs and moans rise from the spectral mass. Words are beyond them, it seems.*
