While enslaved by the Magisters, I noticed a tablet in their excavation site in the Blackpits. It bore markings that looked very similar to how these Swornbreakers were described to me...
*The uncomfortable look on his face is replaced immediately by anger. He pushes you away violently, looking around in case any other Magisters saw what just happened.*
*The squirrel throws you a small piece of bark, on which is scratched the outline of a powerful spell. The shape of the bark somewhat reminds you of teeth...*
*Tell her that dying can be arranged...*
So you are still &lt;i&gt;prey&lt;/i&gt;, but of a different kind. I hunger, and I hear my princelings blubbering in their loving coccoons. Time for us to feast.
Her mournful and slightly accusatory gaze pierces you from the centuries ago when she sat for this portrait.
The hell you didn&apos;t, but you did the smart thing so I guess I won&apos;t hold it against ya.
We followed the blood to a shallow grave.
Paladin Knight
Goblin Champion
Perhaps our paths will cross again. Perhaps not.
*Growl!* Hm. Nice tail. Inmate! Carry on!
*Ifan claps you on the shoulder and beams at you, affection for you plain in his eyes.*
I can&apos;t breathe! Get it OFF M-AAARGH!
Always carry a snack.
*Shake your head. He can handle his own business some other time.*
*Accept your responsibility. You&apos;ll perform the ritual immediately.*
Godwoken? Heh. Stay on the current course, and you&apos;ll be the death of us all.
Our marriage will unite the Houses of War and Law into the House of Dragons. That is how it will be; the prophecy will be complete.
*Startled, he opens his eyes, but he&apos;s staring into the distance. He&apos;s still asleep.*
Fine. But you can&apos;t keep things to yourself. It&apos;s like that snake you talked about. If you don&apos;t handle things right, it&apos;ll bite you in the arse.
Would you please tell this very &lt;i&gt;charming &lt;/i&gt;gaggle of not-at-all-brat-like babes that I am by no accounts this &apos;Lohse&apos; woman? Nor do I &lt;i&gt;sing &lt;/i&gt;- in fact, I&apos;m deathly, deathly allergical!
We found the haft of the Swornbreaker.
*Refuse it.*
I failed.
Ksst! Go - get out! You are not welcome here. GO, man-pig!
Sorry, but Del led you wrong. There&apos;s nothing for you here but secrets you ought not to know.
At the Well of Ascension, Beast supported my claim on Divinity.
*Snap that he can stand aside or you can turn him to kindling. His choice.*
Paladin DeSelby
Well, I&apos;m sure that in your own experience that sentiment is... &lt;i&gt;almost... &lt;/i&gt;true, but no, let me tell you the truth of the matter:
Bloodied Arm
Vitality Points
Cloth Scraps
*Stay until the end.*
I see. Hence your search for a Dreamer. For &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Dreamer, I suppose: the one that bound you to your Master.
It can&apos;t happen to me. It &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;. It can&apos;t, it can&apos;t, it can&apos;t...
You&apos;re not straw - I believe you now. But let me have some peace, will you? I need to hop this off.
Save successful!
*Say you definitely feel your characters are developing.*
You make an offer you can&apos;t even afford? You&apos;re not only a con artist - you&apos;re a bad one!
*Laugh. &lt;i&gt;No.*&lt;/i&gt;
LAN ([1])
I &lt;i&gt;hunger&lt;/i&gt; for you, Fane. There&apos;s no stopping me now.
Hell-o-o-o. You gonna pray all day, buddy?
Hammerfall
The Aeteran! &lt;i&gt;The Aeteran!&lt;/i&gt; It spoke to me, called me to it!
*Beast&apos;s fists slam down hard onto the device. Shards fly from it in all directions, and a red light flickers on.*
*Ifan smiles and moves even closer, nuzzling at your neck with his nose. His beard tickles your reddening throat. The only sound is the whisper of fabric between your bodies.*
I... I was made to weave it! They forced my hand. I never had a wish to... to blemish you; enslave you!
[1] was removed by [2]
*Sashay back to her. Take her into your arms, into your heart, into your very being...*
My thanks! And my best wishes to you, too.
Oh, but to feel the caress of satin on my scarlet skin once more! A most satisfactory answer indeed!
[IFAN] *Say her complicity in the death of thousands of innocents earns her own. Draw your blade.*
*He lands a comradely slap on your back - his strength has definitely returned...*
*Ask her why she was crying.*
Ready to set sail when you are, Your Holiness.
Just look at you! Tame owl. Eyes of a wolf. You don&apos;t come from no farm, I can tell you that!
This forest-green gem is all the rage amongst the nobility. Sell it to a knowledgeable vendor and reap a fantastic reward.
Partisan&apos;s Cuisses
Yes, I am very much aware! Wasn&apos;t my damned head that hit the floor back there.
My eternal thanks, friend. This is a debt I can never repay.
Daggers Drawn
Stop this madness!
Hard to believe you&apos;re looking at a &lt;i&gt;wedding &lt;/i&gt;party, isn&apos;t it?
I&apos;m someone investigating the disappearance of four Magisters. There&apos;s a Sourcerer stalking these streets - an affront to our Order!
Ryker&apos;s salamander spoke in an unfamiliar tongue. If we could speak to it, we might learn a thing or two about its master.
Don&apos;t eat shinies. But I like to look at them. They make happy!
No! No-please-don&apos;t-make-me-leave-my-home-my-&lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;home&lt;/i&gt;-MY-HOME!
*Ask who you&apos;re speaking to.*
*The spirits hang their heads.*
Hoot! Hoot-to-whoo!
Heliotrope
*Say he is right. Humanity&apos;s ruthlessness can barely mask its insecurity.*
Books here for literate sorts.
*Your skin tingles and your joints ache - but soon, tendrils of Source snake from you into him, and from him into you.*
Decorative Elven Dagger
The correct answer, by the way, was &apos;false&apos;.
Ah. I just remembered why I prefer to work alone.
Journal with Note
Your presence disturbs me, dwarf. Go away.
Slane the Winter Dragon
*Ask more about these roses. What are they? What do they do?*
I - I - I mean, you were also quite - that is to say you... um...
Alright... it has the potential to get messy. Very messy indeed. But I&apos;ve got your back if you&apos;ve got mine.
But you&apos;ve got it all wrong, girl. It is &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; who has relinquished her duties by running away from her Master: a crime punishable by death.
Fine... fine. Just... please be discreet. I&apos;m very much at Roost&apos;s mercy, while I&apos;m here.
[NOBLE] *Tell him he&apos;s right - which is why you won&apos;t let him terrorise the seas once more.*
Now, now. Just cause the pair o&apos; you are filthy, cheating liars don&apos;t mean I can&apos;t beat ya.
Source Hound Bruno
*Take her by the hip and press your face against her lips.*
*Grunt and say you&apos;ve arrived just in time. They don&apos;t seem to be doing very well...*
*Whisper to the guard.*
What- be quiet! Are you trying to get us caught?!
*Tell him you&apos;ve changed your mind. You&apos;ll help find this heirloom.*
Take Alexandar&apos;s head.
Focus
Lost...
Stool
What do you think? I can still feel the Shriekers watching us...
Okay, I guess I&apos;ll try. Thanks, mister. I&apos;m gonna go hunt some large animals now and see if I find my mum along the way.
Poison Machine
*Back away from him.*
The lizard courtesan is dead.
They&apos;re these wretched beings mounted on crucifixes. They nearly wiped us out with a single blow. We fled... those of us who still could...
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for certain Sourcerers. You thought he and his Lone Wolves might have some leads.*
Nothing to see here, move along.
Indeed you cannot. Nothing in this world compares to it.
In a display of persuasion beyond extraordinary, we convinced Braccus to abandon his attempt to seize the powers of Divinity.
Leather Pants
Humans, lizards, elves and dwarves all rallied to his banner.
Please. Stop talking. Please.
Of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; I did. But I didn&apos;t have the sway that advisor of hers had. Might has well have spilled my guts to a stone wall.
Your ability to evade attacks.
Pillar of Xantezza
Nightmarish
*Take one last look at her, then turn and walk away.*
*Her hands cradle her head and her shoulders heave and shake. The spirit may make no sound or shed no tears, but there&apos;s no doubt she weeps.*
Grubby Tome
I... I need to rest. You can do this. You are ready. You can finish this now and forever.
Whoever kills the other is the boss!
*Examine the ancient symbol.*
You interrupt yet again. What is it?
What a foolish oversight. If only I&apos;d had your prescience and curiosity, I could have saved myself centuries of pondering that very question.
[MYSTIC] *Note that happiness is a fleeting thought - you prefer balance, wholeness; contentment, if he pleases.*
Shiny! But very dark. Probably because you got this from a Voidwoken.
Mhordkan
*Stammer that you heard strange sounds. You just wanted to make sure he was safe.*
[IFAN] *Tell him you judge yourself the harshest of all.*
Huge Healing Potion
BODY ARMOUR EFFECT
I saw your abysmal treatment of my servant, Isbeil. Please, test my patience no further. This is your last chance. Abandon this folly. Leave, and never return.
*The masked servant does not speak - it only moans.*
Lava Foggy
It was quite terrible and wonderful. Slaughter. Death. Opportunity! We were gathered there in anticipation of Lucian&apos;s Day, when suddenly the ground shook, monsters howled for blood, and fires raged around us.
Don&apos;t judge me, scuffscale, and I won&apos;t judge you.
Wellspring
*She pants and wipes her mouth; blood smears across her sleeve.*
I know I chose right. Should Lucian snub me in the Hall, my pride is still mine. I am prepared for him to rebuke me; it is the price of loyalty.
Know that your sacrifice, my prince, is worthy of your rank - of any rank. Your people would make you emperor if they knew the truth. Alas... they can never know the truth.
Avatar Origin Moment
*Those noises sound like the song you heard when you saw the old lizard&apos;s memories. Try repeating the song you heard her sing.*
*The spirit is silent, resigned to the empty fate you offer.*
If the demon is feeding from her, we need to snuff the candle out. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is how we&apos;ll weaken him.
*A spectral mass lies before you - not one or two beings, but &lt;i&gt;parts of several.&lt;/i&gt; Slaughtered together, then left to rot without care or ritual.*
He... he wants *argh!* blood. He wants BLOOD.
*Ask how you can get to shore.*
*The woman cries on.*
Korper
Source Meditation
I have to say, I thought life would be so great as soon as Marg was dead...
Lanilor&apos;s Head
*Actually, you already have the will! Hand it to the dwarf.*
Dead Civilian
We informed Alexandar of the Sallow Man&apos;s death.
Silver Vein
Go s-see Dorotya. She can help. With your good life.
*Announce that the tinkerer, the one suspected in these Magister disappearances, has escaped from Driftwood.*
*Candles bathe the bare feet of the winged stone figure in warm light as she reaches to the ceiling.*
On the Origins of Lucian
&lt;i&gt;Hssssss&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
The powers of the universe rushing through your body and you feel strange? Heavens no.
Barbed Wire
We saved a group of Black Ring prisoners from execution by the Magisters.
A statue of Braccus&apos; elite guard. Ha! They fell like autumn leaves against the House of War.
I think I just met a god. I feel a great power within me, now. Something that wasn&apos;t there before.
*The automaton doesn&apos;t react to your presence at all.*
This chest had hoped to see you return a little more... draconic, mistress.
I NEED to see the eyes. I NEED to press the jelly out. I NEED to SEE the EYES!
Can&apos;t be sure. Kemm&apos;s scouring that Magister vault he found. If he&apos;s discovered anything in there, I haven&apos;t heard word of it.
