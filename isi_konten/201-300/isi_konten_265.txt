Wherever the whistle calls me, sir! Though, no doubt with the war preparations the way they are now... I&apos;ll be called up to the front lines. Sir!
*Agree that the Seekers have a tough battle ahead.*
A mushroom that&apos;s notoriously forbidden in most wizard universities.
Did I? Why was she here, if I did &lt;i&gt;everything &lt;/i&gt;I could? Why didn&apos;t I steal her away? Take her somewhere safe? It&apos;s my fault. It&apos;s all my fault...
Well, then they&apos;ll be home soon, won&apos;t they? Why would they stay in a place that isn&apos;t nice? See, Ben? Joe and his mum will be back soon.
Oh, come now. Your actions betrayed your guilt - and now you would lie to a Lord? You should be punished twice over.
You traded my people for power and a demon&apos;s favour. I am showing you the respect you&apos;ve earned.
Lone Wolf Contract
*You take a step closer. The sound becomes more pronounced. There&apos;s definitely moaning going on, but what &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of moaning?*
*She motions to the fallen guards littering the walkway. It&apos;s an impressive number of bodies.*
Transform into the form of a Dwarf, switching racial talents, skills and tags.
*Decide to leave him to his soundscape and take your leave.*
*Say you take it this is the &apos;Change&apos; he&apos;s referring to?*
Hmmm? What can I do for ya, lass?
But don&apos;t wait too long.
Mind Maggot Grenade Recipe
*Tell him you&apos;ve felt for awhile that it might be better if you went your separate ways. Permanently.*
Better luck next time.
*Tell her you found her eggs, but they were transformed into Voidwoken.*
Very well, Godsire. Tell me, what do you wish for?
Skills From Game Master
One cannot &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; to blind eyes.
Explosive Arrowhead
Har har. I don&apos;t need your gold. When all this is over, I&apos;m taking to the stage once more. And if you&apos;re very nice, I&apos;ll get you tickets. Third or fourth row.
Do you indeed? My friend Tatcher here reckons she&apos;d like to do the same, despite the fact that consortin&apos; with the enemy could see her posted to Fort Joy. I think she&apos;s crazy. Tell us how it went, won&apos;t you?
So they&apos;re blaming the Ancient Empire for Alexandar&apos;s supposed death. A classic ruse of misdirection and rabble rousing the House of War is quite familiar with.
Amyro hinted that whoever took the supplies shares a certain physical tic with Griff - repeatedly clearing his throat.
Giant Frost Rune Of Power
*Roll your eyes and walk away.*
*Tell her that&apos;s way too expensive.*
*Wonder who&apos;s going to buy such miserable-looking fish.*
*Back away.*
Well, there&apos;s nothing left for me here.
Petrification Pressure
What were you thinking messin&apos; with Griff&apos;s brutes anyhow?
Immortality is only permanent, my dearest, until one day it simply ceases to be.
*Lash back. Religious sorts are all the same. Does he think &lt;i&gt;prayer &lt;/i&gt;can depose a despot?*
Of course you do! Everyone likes chocolate. It&apos;s delicious, and rare, and brings joy to the masses.
GOOD things occur. No lie! Very good things! Just o&apos;en the chest!
Sanctuary of Amadia
Intolerable! Please tell me, my prince, you&apos;ll not heed these ill-fated words!
He fled into this stinking shed, but we&apos;ll find him again. We&apos;ll have our justice.
A man after my own heart.
Fauchard
*Comply with his request.*
*Wonder what happened to his escort.*
*Remind her of her prior retreat. She is no threat to you!*
H-healed...? I&apos;m healed!
And what do &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;want?
Hold here, Quercus - I need a moment with our friend.
Duna! What- what &lt;i&gt;happened &lt;/i&gt;to you? Did you truly fall so far?
Source has become dangerous. It will undo us all.
*Sympathise with her - it must have been frightening to see him change like that.*
[OUTLAW] *Say they seem to be running an interesting operation and offer your help.*
I have my freedom. You have your reward. Do you not recall my warning?
*She does not waver. She does not panic. She only stares, before vanishing into nothingness.*
Floyd Deschian
Let&apos;s take you to prison. Maybe there, you learn proper respect for authority.
Damn it, Arhu. Where are you, you old fool?
Delusions of Grandeur
*The pond becomes engulfed in a bloody mist that enshrines an augur-like silence.*
You can walk away from me, but if you see anything strange, report it immediately! Or the next Magister to go will be on your head...
Raise Bone Smasher
The plan is twofold: first you must do me a favour, then I will teach you: enlarge your mastery of the Source. You will need all the strength you can muster - and more - before we confront your visitor. The second part we&apos;ll discuss after the lesson, so first let us turn to the favour.
The Gods can&apos;t smite those Shriekers themselves, my friend - but they can guide your hand.
[OUTLAW] *Protest. How else are you supposed to make an honest living?*
*Say that the Seekers&apos; power and presence will strike fear in those wretched half-living weapons. They should push forward with courage.*
I truly didn&apos;t think you&apos;d have &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;much fight in you. I&apos;ll win my title back, I will! But first, I&apos;m going to find somebody a lot nicer than you to kiss all this better...
&lt;i&gt;Shht!&lt;/i&gt; Quiet! *Gasp* Better if they don&apos;t take notice. They&apos;ll only make it *gasp* tighter.
Aurnia
No-one to keep them warm, no-one to keep them safe...
Round Gold Necklace
A thief &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a liar? Time to do the world a favour.
&lt;i&gt;Ifan?&lt;/i&gt; Ben-Mezd, is that truly you? By Rhalic, I &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; I saw you at the Fort&apos;s gates. But... how did you survive the Deathfog?
Their evil knows no bounds.
Party
Charmed
Variety is the spice of torture.
Medium Venom Rune
*The Magister&apos;s spirit waits for relief that never comes.*
Arrow Water
*Don&apos;t wait.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without settling the argument. Perhaps they argue still.
The dark. The dark. The dangerous dark.
Not without Ma! Family doesn&apos;t just leave each other.
We found the door to Bloodmoon Island&apos;s archives. One part of Anathema should be inside.
*Your God flies forth, grasping at Xantezza&apos;s neck, but her hands connect with nothing. She spins, confused and snarling.*
Ohhhhhhhhh. Yeah. Hang on - I thought that joke wuz about Alexandar? Alexandar doing his... you know... inna woods.
Aye, yer knife needs to be quick and true for these. It&apos;s easy to cut off the extra fins, but dancing yer blade around the tumours can be tricky.
The dwarf Lohar in Driftwood will want to know what happened to the caravan.
*The lizard&apos;s eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness.*
You expecting a tip? Well, here&apos;s one: moisturise!
*Ask if is this truly what he wants.*
If I&apos;m correct, and Sadha&apos;s heart has been darkened by the Ring, you may be able to find her through their scrying magic.
*Laugh. Can she read the future in cow entrails as well?*
I must say I like them better dead.
The breastplate - it grew out of a dead bloody &lt;i&gt;elf&lt;/i&gt;, but Herman wouldn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;listen.&lt;/i&gt;
Forest - Small Glade
*Ask her what you&apos;re meant to do now.*
*The child points at Roost with wide, still eyes.*
She has seen truth. Set her free; let her find her own way.
*He shoots you a patronising smile, the most infuriating smile you&apos;ve ever seen in all your years on this earth.*
*Reach into your satchel and hand him a shiny red ball.*
Greetings, my lady. Looking to ease the pain of a decaying world? You&apos;re in the right place. Beers are ordered at the bar, but can I interest you in a nourishing bowl of stew?
*He holds out a pouch of gold. You try to take it, but he doesn&apos;t yet relinquish his grasp. With his free hand, he wags a finger in your face.*
&lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;
Secrets, secrets, they&apos;re no fun. Secrets, secrets..
Because they&apos;re collaborating with the Black Ring! It&apos;s no coincidence that those monstrosities appeared just as we confronted them about their betrayal. At least Lord Kemm&apos;s putting a stop to them now.
The fish is indeed malignant! Dwarves are affected by it in the same manner as other species!
H-helping Sourcerers. W-w-we &lt;i&gt;thought &lt;/i&gt;we could help them against the Magisters, but... but...
*Wonder what happens next for her.*
*Say that you heard from an... &lt;i&gt;unseemly source&lt;/i&gt; that Lucian put a lot of stock in purity. Ask if there&apos;s any truth in that.*
*Windego is, at last, at her end. Consume her Source.*
Besides, one gets used to this kind of thing so quickly. This is hardly the first time someone&apos;s filled some poor fool&apos;s purse and bid him kill the prince.
The God King rewards &lt;i&gt;daring&lt;/i&gt;. I thought I could capture this place alone, while the others were occupied... but there&apos;s more dangers here than I would&apos;ve credited it with.
God Rays
Open the door to the mountain.
*She grabs your hand with hers and twists. Pain shoots through your arm, and you can&apos;t but disengage.*
Oh! Did I say it too fast? I&apos;m so sorry!
[RED PRINCE] *Demand to be told what house this undead lizard once belonged to.*
Together, Quercus, we can develop some magic to save us from the Great Acorn - &lt;i&gt;if &lt;/i&gt;our Shield can keep us alive.
*A horrified fisherman stares at the water, muttering to himself.*
Oh wow. Mum said dwarves like drinking just as much as singing. I guess she was right!
Fossil Strike Skillbook
Here - I&apos;ve made this especially for our kind. Take it, with my compliments.
*You start to speak, but it&apos;s too late. Rhalic breaks free, and the voice that emerges from your mouth is not quite your own.*
Rueful day made worse by a hideous stranger. What is it.
*The spirit hesitates, piecing the fragmented memories together...*
Zillik
Dunno why she helped us. She never seemed to like us much. That&apos;s a chapter ended, then.
I supported Sebille&apos;s claim on Divinity. Sebille is the new Divine.
Touch my darlings again, and there&apos;ll be hell to pay. Understand?
She hides now. Maybe you meet her, if you are gentle. I find her in the camp. Her parents are already taken.
Now, now; no need to fuss. I&apos;ll be fine.  It&apos;s just that travelling between the *wince* realms isn&apos;t easy, you know. It takes something from my soul each time. But never you fear: I&apos;ve pulled a clever trick out of my sleeve. The Lady Vengeance stands in two realms at once. Her body here, her soul in the Hall of Echoes. You can still return at your leisure.
...a bottle o&apos; air-oh, fill it up to the brim! Stick your sorrows in there-oh...
*The gauntlet he&apos;s working on - is it a Magister piece? Something that he took from them?*
*Greet Exter warmly. What is he doing in this prison?*
Ruins of the Arena of the One
*Change your mind, and say you were only jesting with her.*
And I will be damned if I let the lives of some mayflies get in my way.
*Decide not to risk angering her.*
*You push her away, staggering backwards until you rest gasping against the door. The figure in the bed draws the curtains and smiles as she is bathed in moonlight.*
Hullo, stranger.
*You can feel her loving hold slipping away from you: recoiling as if in anger.*
*A lizard, tall and beautiful, turns towards you. His eyes widen...*
Ah. Now speak the spell... and see what I&apos;ve gotten for us.
The lich retrieved its Soul Jar and left us its cache.
*Tell the judge he hasn&apos;t made a hero, but an abomination.*
Here. You can take this off my hands. More suited to your kind, really.
You&apos;re here though, so there&apos;s still hope of a new Divine. Now, do you want my help, or not?
We&apos;re in y-your debt.
Got any fish? The kind that makes my tummy feel like the night sky?
This ushered in a new golden age of peace and prosperity.
