No deal. What are you, a pauper?
Sitting&apos; pretty and gen&apos;rally not answering questions from nosy parkers who ain&apos;t Lone Wolves. Them, we eat the neck-apples right out of their throats. Hur-hur-hur.
Betty the turtle is in love with Rory the rat, but he won&apos;t slow down long enough for her to tell him.
You know sacrifices had to be made during the war? Well, Lucian knew he needed to use Deathfog to eliminate the Black Ring. But doing that would... would kill the elves also. So, we came up with a plan.
*Ask the ghost what happened here.*
Lucian. He doomed us all when he adopted the baby Damian.
They smell even worse dead than alive... let&apos;s head above-decks for some air.
I&apos;ve faced worse.
*Arhu shakes his head slowly.*
There will be another Divine. They say Bishop Alexandar is Godwoken. I hope... I hope he&apos;ll ascend before it&apos;s too late.
Heroes? Pffh! They should have stayed in their graves rather than sully their reputations like that.
Yeah, yeah. I heard you the first time.
Shriekers?! Do not mock me, flesh! I would never be so crude and inelegant.
Come, gather close and let me tell you my philosophy. It concerns one matter only: the appreciation of small things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, consider the exquisite ordinariness and usefulness of an everyday object like the Crafter&apos;s Kit. Welcome its invaluable assistance in your life and you&apos;ll never look back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember my words, friend. Appreciate the small things. A big life can only be composed of many small and wonderful things.
We were giddy. High on our own success. We should&apos;ve seen the massacre coming - but we didn&apos;t. I was the first to die, but hardly the last...
*Tell him that from what you&apos;ve seen, there&apos;s no hope for her.*
Dwarf Skeleton
What is this...? Something lodged inside her... in her head...
Oh, don&apos;t look so astonished. I simply suspect we&apos;ve had much the same experience. We met with our god: you with Rhalic, I with Zorl-Stissa.
Makes my bones itch...
It&apos;s just... I thought maybe, you know when you were down deep in the water... you didn&apos;t hear a -
[SCHOLAR] *Well, Cranley Huwbert&apos;s work is generally seen as the authority, but you can recommend some histories of each race.*
*Tell her that her husband was undead.*
Lord Arhu
*The slab remains lifeless, but you sense power lurking within the cold stone.*&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;I am so looking forward to meeting you.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Lucian&apos;s love! Thank you, but please - you have to hurry! Go!
*Smile back. They have your best wishes.*

...How could the Gods steal such a gentle soul from us? What... what more could we have done to appease them?
Legend tells that this staff bears the souls of three great elven leaders, each one granting the lucky wielder a different skill.
until two years later a jealous lover stabbed her in the heart with a mutton fork.
*The moment your finger reaches the flower&apos;s stem, icy darkness pierces your heart. The chill freezes your bones, then rushes free, leaving a single word etched within you: &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Bid him tell you all he knows about the Doctor.*
Ah, you &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;understand! Joyous day! I haven&apos;t spoken to a living soul in... in what must be a millennium by now. How lucky I am to meet you!
Vial
My word, but a pretty thing like you shouldn&apos;t look so exhausted. Perhaps you could use a touch of... magic?
Light Breeches
You say you&apos;re innocent, but your face tells me otherwise. Why should I believe you?
Right. Well, I&apos;d like to continue together, too. But listen here: There&apos;s something off between us. We aren&apos;t of a mind.
Italian
*Ask what he wants from this particular demon he&apos;s hunting.*
Two-Handed Mace
What a monumental waste of time. No no, I have been curious about this for far too long, let us begin at once!
Do you think me stupid? I&apos;ll not leave my post at the behest of some scaled freak. Get out of my sight!
Cooper
*Bow your head and yield to Zorl-Stissa, your god.*
Numpad Plus
Well, anyway. Glad to be back. If you need any magical goods, it looks like my satchel was restored along with the rest of me!
Saheila sought to strengthen the elven alliance with the new Divine. Her powers of sight proved useful in the ongoing war against the Void. But she could never be sure that the new Divine trusted her.
True Twine

Freshly Mended Teddy Bear
It&apos;s a riddle, innit? A conundrum. A whotsit yer&apos;ll hafta solve.
...if the rumours are true, I’ll be rich as an Ancient. Can&apos;t expect less from a king&apos;s vault – even one on a prison island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it’s anything like the Silverglen jails, getting out’ll be as easy as getting in. They’ll take any Sourcerer these days, and that’s easy enough to fake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**&lt;br&gt;Landed. Found a good mark right away. Says he’s got a teleporter spell I can filch easy enough. Just had to say I’d escape with him. Far be it from me to lead a stranger to all that gold, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So close I can almost smell it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vault oughta be just outside the prison, if I can believe Barberra. Her map&apos;s my golden ticket. I see it behind my lids when I close my eyes.
*The woman called Isbeil glares at you with stony face and obdurate eyes.*
Disrespect! You spurn Master&apos;s gifts! Leave now, leave Master and I alone!
*Assure the spirit that it&apos;s safe - you&apos;re here now.*
*The Mother Tree shudders, and then you hear... a commotion, above and around you. The elves are... distressed. You may be in trouble.*
She wished to overcome the true Emperor, and sought the dragon&apos;s bones to make armour that could channel the beast.
Already I can feel the power of the acorn in me. Crawl for me, worm!
They locked him up, but he got out, and - they went crazy! They all went crazy!
House Interior - Basement D
I&apos;m gonna go now.
*Wonder if he can teach you what he learned from Hannag.*
I do apologise if I came across as impertinent just now, and I hope you&apos;ll forgive my unabating boldness when I assume sir has come here in search of an audience with either Lord or Lady Kemm?
Retreat from me! I may have lost my Source but I can still best a reptile like yourself...
There may be more Voidwoken on the shore.
You stink of gold, merc! Hahaha! &lt;i&gt;You stink of gold!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ve come to collect, Ifan. I presume you intend to honour our agreement?
It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; you! Ifan ben-Mezd. I remember you... you were my captain&apos;s commander, way way back in the war.
I can deduct one recipe from this book, but this reads more like a puzzle than a recipe. I will have to experiment with what I can learn from these rhymes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creepy dead magic requires one shadow&lt;br&gt;And ghoulish ingredients, skulls and bone marrow&lt;br&gt;With parchment and paper you then can compose&lt;br&gt;Malevolent magic and sinister scrolls
The way I see it, I was standing at a line. Not a line between &apos;good&apos; and &apos;bad&apos;. A line between... knowing and not knowing.
Spicy and hot, this lava coloured brew infuses the body with enhanced strength.
He was mad, but his fascination with yarrow tells me a splinter of his true personality remained.
Even if I had the means to slay her... her corpse is of no use to us. Her knowledge, her power - they could mean &lt;i&gt;everything.&lt;/i&gt;
But when did that ever stop me before?
I answer to the Princess. Go and see her. After, I will do as she bids me to.
Go on, open da chest. Please.
Look. I already killed Alexandar. &lt;i&gt;Twice!&lt;/i&gt;
How glad I am to hear you say that. It will make your repentance all the more rewarding  for both of us.
According to Ymmit, Shriekers are made out of tortured Sourcerers - their minds and souls twisted by dark magic. They blast Source so powerful that it instantly kills anyone caught. They are usually used to deter trespassers.
I... I&apos;m losing control. It&apos;s stronger than me. I can&apos;t trust myself anymore...
The bleeding&apos;s stopped... thank you!
Now all we have to do is wrap matters up...
And you are?
*Before you go, you want to ask him about something else.*
Very funny.
I&apos;ll just... wait here, then.
The goddess provides. She lead me to this shrine and protected me from the marsh that was so poisoned by Braccus. Today she cares for me still.
*Speak a phrase you read in the captain&apos;s log: &lt;i&gt;&apos;High and hale waves take us.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
You desired love, the finest treasure. And so it&apos;s yours. Your friends will be even more loyal. Where our relationship ends, others will flourish.
*Tell the lizard you&apos;re here to bring light to the shadows.*
He made his choices, and he lived and died with the consequences. Luck doesn&apos;t come into it.
Unusual Platemail Gloves
*Politely ask her to remove the needle so you and her can talk this over like civilised people.*
You&apos;re only making matters worse for yourself. Come on, off to prison with you.
Robe of Power
I saw... I saw... Rivellon, but there &lt;i&gt;was &lt;/i&gt;no Rivellon. There were no people; no Ancient Empire; none of our people; none of our great works.

I&apos;m busy. The world doesn&apos;t revolve around you.
UI Back
A blood vial labelled &apos;Beryl Griff&apos;
Retreat from me; I may have lost my Source but I can still best a puny elf like yourself...
I&apos;m ready to fight to protect that. Whatever it may take.
Leave me be. I&apos;ve done nothing!
Yes, your secrets are your own. But make sure they are worth keeping close to your heart.
Piano
*You have more need of Source than this hollow apparition. Suck it dry.*
Sometimes, in that vast phantasmagorical chaos, two storm-tossed kernels meet and become a constant.
Let&apos;s leave it at that, friend. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have work to do. People in the stew indeed.
[MYSTIC] *There is a song in this hum. Listen carefully to it.*
*Protest. You haven&apos;t sinned against her - but she&apos;s sinned plenty against you!*
Sorry for the trouble. Keep your nose clean, though.
Legend
But the Magisters chain me and send my spores away - for &lt;i&gt;study.&lt;/i&gt; And in wrong hands...
&lt;i&gt;Alexandar was Godwoken. Once, years ago, I should have killed Damian, but instead took him as my son. Quite the mistake. Now, I was forced to kill Alexandar, my blood. But once more, I could not.&lt;/i&gt;
The Baron
Welp - looks like we&apos;re celebratin&apos; Lucian&apos;s Day with a shipwreck! Rest in pieces, m&apos;Lady.
*For a moment you watch the children play. Then you leave them to it.*
*A feeling looms inside you.*
Arena mode
Speak with the boy Karon.
happy to wait for the war to pass.
*You see Ifan in earnest conversation with the dwarven woman. All of a sudden, he pales and staggers backwards. The woman laughs, a tinkling sound like glass smashing on a stone floor.*
*The name upon the old grave marker can no longer be made out.*
Who builds a mansion on the edge of a graveyard?
We fled from combat.
*The prisoner&apos;s gaze finds the sunken hollows that once held your eyes. He speaks not with gratitude, but with gleeful malevolence.*
Oh be quiet, you animal. I almost feel bad for you.
Let the Red Prince hatch the egg.
*Note that he&apos;s no elf - ask why a lizard would devote himself to Tir-Cendelius.*
Ho-hum. I guess I&apos;ll just have to relive my own glory days.
