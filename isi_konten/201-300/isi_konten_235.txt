We convinced the spirit of Duna’s Undertaker to lift the feathers’ curse.
*Tell her that that&apos;s a trick you haven&apos;t quite mastered.*
We trace our lineage back to the time of Tenax himself - she could not ask to bear children from a more noble lineage.

*The being inside you rumbles a very clear &apos;no&apos;.*
A worthy dream, lad. I&apos;m sure you can claim a patch for yourself after all this is over.
Nice throne, at least.
Mage Boots
It&apos;s been a good while now since I&apos;ve seen a document written in the traditional way. Looks like their plans to attack the sawmill.
*The spirit tries to use her arms to shield herself from her tormentor, to little avail.*
Was I not clear the first time? Get out of here!
Not your first fight - that was clear to see. Always glad to have a veteran at my side...
Sometimes... sometimes you have to take some lives to save others. And I shall always put dwarven lives first. You &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;understand this.
*The flies nip at your bones; they sting you and sting you and sting you. After you are almost completely spent, the witch releases you from her grasp and stands back, wiping her mouth.*
Suffice to say I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; in love, in such a way that it is the very core of my entire existence.
*Sigh* Just &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;was that? Have you made no effort at all on developing your constitution? You&apos;re about as charming as a dog with worms!
*Remain still; this spirit cannot hurt you.*
Go on. &apos;Fore I get sick of the squint in yer eye and gut ye myself.
Very good, kitten. Now, I imagine you&apos;re here for the same reason I am.
*Where does he think his people are? In some other realm?*
Toadskin Shoes
Hold on just a moment. I came here in search of the Master, but I&apos;ve yet to uncover a clue.
New friends and old. Banging on the door. Fire falling from the sky...
Charged Amphibian
*Say you can see the merits of taking a little respite before such a dangerous endeavour.*
Shoulda paid... shoulda paid... always pay... Momma said... can&apos;t fool a troll... gotta pay the toll... always pay... shoulda paid...
*She pushes you forward, rolling you flat onto your back, her whole body still wrapped around yours.*
Wrong. Paladin and Magister fought and fell alongside each other, as brothers. I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d ever see the Divine Order united once again, under its true leader...
Silence! I won&apos;t have the grovelling of that whelp Braccus delivered by some half-wit servant! Only when he prostrates himself before me will I even begin to consider the notion of forgiving him!
Quite the vision, aren&apos;t I? You should go before you get hurt.
Then she screamed. A scream so abhorrent its ripples caused birds to fall dead from the sky. People covered their ears in vain as they went insane.
I am to be the father of dragons, and she, the Red Princess, is to be the mother.
My wife&apos;s dead, buddy.
I had feared as much. This is a sad day. A sad day indeed.
Withermoore tried to kill us for not destroying his Soul Jar.
This is... this is &lt;i&gt;disgusting!&lt;/i&gt; Why are we helping these Gods at all? They&apos;re nothing but self-serving thieves!
Applies Healing.
*Tell her that that&apos;s fine. There&apos;s no-one on this island you much care for.*
*Cough weakly and tell her you are terminally infected with Deathfog. Which is contagious. But you&apos;d be happy to shuffle out and fetch her a snack.*
Yes... I am sorry. She had me built to her exact designs - not even I know all the ways in which she can control me. She was able to follow my wake like a shark.
I... I know what you mean. I can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;wait &lt;/i&gt;to leave this place. I can&apos;t get it out of my head!
*Snap at her - what the hell was that?*
Some of us are not only touched by it. We are... we are destroyed.
*Lie. The Sallow Man told you of her. You knew who she was from the moment you arrived.*
Benches
And hurry. It won&apos;t take long for the saps in the Fort to figure out you murdered their Bishop.
Flayed faces. How &lt;i&gt;delightfully &lt;/i&gt;old-fashioned.
Madness has descended. Where Karon roams, the thunder claps and the city burns!
Thanks, darling. Much obliged for letting all the blood out of that Magister for me.
[JESTER] *Tell the cub to grin and bear it. Get it?*
Arx goes from bad to worse. I fear we won&apos;t recover.
*Tell him someone needs to keep an eye on Adramahlihk. Han will be your watchman.*
*Ask who he is.*
[IFAN] *Say you know who hunts Godwoken: &lt;i&gt;Lone Wolves.&lt;/i&gt; You carry part of the contract with you right now.*
Brayton Barnes

Wait, wait. This isn&apos;t enough, not for one of &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; poems.
&lt;i&gt;*Girl?&lt;/i&gt; Tell him he ought to think twice before addressing you like a child.*
Applies Acid and Poisoned.
You&apos;re right: I suppose you don&apos;t look like a Magister. Besides, those dogs wouldn&apos;t have dared to call me out like that.
Lady Augusta
Bird &amp; Wind Desert 01
There must be one to be found somewhere...
Alright, pass freely.
You say their names in jest, but I wouldn&apos;t invoke these evils so easily. What is long thought dead, sometimes returns.
Her legacy was recovering the Devourer&apos;s sacred bones. Yours will be conquering the world clad in his armour!
*He set you up. You should kill him.*
You some kind of an expert on Voidwoken?
*Recount the flesh-memory you saw. &lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt; had done this.*
If that road should happen to lead straight to a quiet spot with a mat on the floor and no-one watching, well... you won&apos;t hear any complaints from &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;corner.
*Scoff at the shrine&apos;s presence in this desperate place.*
Met with his spirit you say? My, my, my! Who&apos;s the little mouse that comes a-sniffing out the wolf? Could he be... &lt;i&gt;a Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that Gareth is a tried and true Seeker. He will always do what&apos;s right.*
*Deny it all.*
Until next time. Take care o&apos; yourself.
A step in the right direction, I suppose.
The Red Prince found a dreamer. The dreamer was dead.
More weapons to fight the Sourcerers, she said. She needed the wands, but- *groans* but there was something more. We got greedy...
*She saunters around the room, inspecting it like she plans to move in. She tosses her head over her shoulder and calls out to you in an affected tone:*
I know you, ben-Mezd. I know your lupine light. I&apos;ll snuff your light, snuff it out...
How dare you hatch my child without my permission? You don&apos;t realise the danger of waking a dragon, do you?&lt;br&gt;
*Tell him to hold up - &lt;i&gt;Crocodilians?&lt;/i&gt; How many?*
Wishing you nothing but the &lt;i&gt;best,&lt;/i&gt; Red Prince.
*About Kemm&apos;s stolen painting...*
[BARBARIAN] *Stare at her. Hard.*
campaign name
*Smile and tell her Zorl-Stissa, god of lizards, wants the same of you.*
*Jump back - your mother was a lizard - she didn&apos;t have soft skin!*
*Tell her that after all she&apos;s done for you, you&apos;d be a fool not to consider her your greatest ally.*
Our master&apos;s purpose is his own to speak - not mine.
Will you join us?
*Say you&apos;ve heard he&apos;s a good friend to have, and ask if there&apos;s anything you can help him with.*
I&apos;m sure your skill would prove invaluable, whatever your House, were there Voidwoken left to slay. I&apos;m afraid the terrors waiting within aren&apos;t so &lt;i&gt;tangible, &lt;/i&gt;however.&lt;br&gt;
The body stays there. Kemm&apos;s orders.
Our fives are naught but dust. They crumbled to nothing centuries before.
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there. Kari&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt she&apos;ll be caring much who or what she slices.
[HERO] *Tell her you&apos;re trying to help her and her father. You have no reason to lie.*
My Fort Joy saviour. I never thought I&apos;d clap eyes on you again...
Heh. You never were one to let your guard down. Not most of the time, anyway. There&apos;s no tellin&apos; what forces could sway her next. Freedom&apos;s not a one-time deal. You&apos;ll lose it if you don&apos;t keep fightin&apos; for it.
Sure. Leya&apos;s her name. She&apos;ll be down by the water. Word of warning, though? She&apos;s... kind of a basket case.
*Stick a thumb through one of the holes in your garb and say these provide cool in summer.*
You are not the Sssallow Man.
*Excruciating heat tries to squeeze the life out of you, like you&apos;re trapped in a massive burning fist.*
Explore the shoreline.
I&apos;m sure you will.
Better to detonate that mine safely than trip over it myself.
From their rallying-point at an old Magister camp, the Seekers will seize the ship while we attack the Magisters on the shore.
My kind of salty ol&apos; crank. She certainly seems to want to help us - you don&apos;t get many of those in life. I&apos;ve learned to appreciate &apos;em where I find &apos;em.
*Say yes. You&apos;re here to hunt Stingtail after all, not any lizard that happens to pass on by.*
&lt;i&gt;You&apos;ll be a hero. Everyone will know of the sacrifice you&apos;ll make. Your name will be synonymous with the survival of Rivellon.&lt;/i&gt;
WHAT IS MAKING THAT SOUND!
Cursed Fire
Do you see anything?
Gained a Source Point.
Explore the lower sewers.
*A faint feeling flits over you and then is gone - and you realise that the marrow is yours. And suddenly your purse feels... heavier.*
[Wits Check]
I never trusted the dwarves, of course.  Such a vulgar little people.
*He continues stroking his beard, a beatific smile on his lips, and doesn&apos;t acknowledge you anymore.*
*The cat spirit looks to you. The further you gaze into its vacant eyes, the blacker your heart feels. With a jolt, you avert your glance and move away.*
Yes, you have never seen such a remarkably fine creature in all your short, wretched days. I am sure you have many fascinating questions.
Yes! Kidney! Good for courage, good for warrior! You will fight well, now Master&apos;s blood runs within you.

But we don&apos;t have anything to give you!
We decided to kill the Advocate after he revealed the location of the Nameless Isle to us.
*He glances over at Magister Viktar, who&apos;s staring back at him with pointed intensity.*
[BEAST] *Remember the worst insults your crew ever came up with. Then hammer the door with them all.*
*You bury your face in her fur, your nostrils assailed by musk of bear - a combination of sweat, and fish, and... something else. You remember what bears do in the woods...*
Something&apos;s afoot. Checking it out.
*His expression hardens. He produces, in one hand, a dagger.*
*Give control of your body over to Amadia - let her speak directly to the Eternal.*
[ELF] *You recognise elven magic - what had they done?*
*Tell her she&apos;s welcome. It was worth it, to get that demon out of her.*
There you are! I&apos;ve got my sights set on the Nameless Isle - no thanks to you, I must say. We can set sail when you&apos;re ready.
*Say it sounds familiar. Perhaps she told you in a long-forgotten dream.*
Did you see them, miss? Bishop Alexandar and the Hammer herself! They... they were so close. Almost within arm&apos;s reach...
Good news, you get to relive them in death too.
*Isbeil cocks her head and smiles.*
Looking for a lackey? Look around somewhere else... I&apos;ll be making my own way from now on.
But... I bit some straw. It was shaped a little like you, but then it &lt;i&gt;moved&lt;/i&gt;, and threw me off of it!
*Drain the spirit of its Source.*
