Eternal Sentinel
*Tell the child he owes you for his friend&apos;s freedom.*
The God King&apos;s current beloved. No more skin on his real bones than on a peeled jackfruit. And it is not only his ear the God King whispers into. The dwarf called Isbeil. She bends to the King&apos;s every whim.
[This notebook is full of scribbled notes and elaborate schematics that seem to pertain to a large-scale release of Deathfog.]
I&apos;m not like the cat-lord. Ar-hoo-loo. He slinks around and under and over and inside. He would skim the path and miss the blood.

Dust bunny?! *Sigh* Just rat.
The island of Fort Joy remained a Sourcerer&apos;s &apos;paradise&apos;, a place of exile for those whose Sourcery threatened to bring in the Void. For their well-being, its residents depended entirely on the benevolence of the new Divine.
And I mean &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; money.
I am a Dragon Knight, aren&apos;t I? We have a knack for knowing.
The indignity! I&apos;m supposed to send people down to the dungeons, not the other way around.
That&apos;s right: The ship&apos;s made of an elven ancestor tree. The spirit of which is still trapped in every plank.
I... am... Baraaannn&lt;i&gt;naaAAAAHHH!&lt;/i&gt;
There you are! Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m fine! Now, where&apos;s the last of us.
What...what happened? The last thing I remember was hunting the...

Denial? Pathetic! We know from the flesh of your generals that is was you who whispered poison in their ears. We know from their flesh that you made the perfect plan to eradicate both us and the Ring!
Seek to know more.
A kin, is it? A traitor cannot be murdered. A traitor can only receive their due. Doubly so for a lizard traitor. It&apos;s a pity she couldn&apos;t die twice.
*Ignoring you completely, he calls for Sadha.*
Good! Tell me, how do you bet? For the half-blood? Or against? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*She bends for a rag and wipes her bloodied hands. She looks up and sees you.*
Ifan. Brave warrior. Dear noble wolf. Rest now, stay with me a while.
Of course there&apos;s Sadha. But never mind that now.

I thought you&apos;d see things my way. Come, make yourself comfortable. We&apos;ll have a chat when you&apos;re ready.
*The spirit squeezes her eyes closed, but the rhythm of her prayer becomes more animated as the Source drains away from her. Her face contorts in pain; she screams silently.*

Now where did I leave my calipers?
So: Here we are, after everything. Mere mortals, still.
Mordus&apos; Amulet
To draw back the veil and see the truth is no simple task. To seek the unknown. Maybe even the unknowable.
*Reach over and ruffle his hair with a grin.*
I guess I&apos;m a Sourcerer too. That&apos;s why I&apos;m here, right? And you too.

An unusual-looking wand. For the moment, this wand has no magical properties. It&apos;s a very nice, straight stick though!
We have to get moving, Reimond. Let&apos;s end this.
*Steel yourself and draw your weapon.*
You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; here to free me, right?

[SOLDIER] *Intimidating his captain? That&apos;s gross insubordination; he should be &lt;i&gt;whipped!*&lt;/i&gt;
Can it be? A... a lizard? Why, I never thought I&apos;d see the day... Do you understand me, madam? I daresay I ought to enunciate: CAN. YOU. HELP. ME?
*Say that a woman called Windego told you that Linder Kemm was a member of the Black Ring.*
*Take your leave.*
I forgot how to sing. I did!

Oh honey. You look so nonplussed. It was just a nibble, not a mist of Deathfog.

It&apos;s good to have Gwyd back. I couldn&apos;t bear to lose him again. To lose&lt;i&gt; anyone &lt;/i&gt;again...
My Master, you will kneel before him too. You&apos;ll see.
Calming Cover
Kind of you to ask. Stefan, he was my little one. Smart as a whip and no less wicked! And my husband, he was called Felix. He was an expert healer. Could fix a broken bone in a short minute!
Ready...

Very well, but tell us as soon as you have something to report.
So, what&apos;ll it be? Are you with me?
Hah. No, I&apos;m not alright. That wasn&apos;t ok.
Speak with Magister Borris.
&lt;i&gt;A pitiful sight his inadequate fight, the quivering lump sent out of queen&apos;s sight.&lt;br&gt;Marcus Miles, bastard born, the royal knights upstaged him.&lt;/i&gt;
