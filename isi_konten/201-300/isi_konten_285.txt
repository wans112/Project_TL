Do you want to stay a cow for the rest of your life? No? Then, Geraldine, it is &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;a good thing.
When the time comes, as it surely must, he will make it as difficult for you to kill him as he can. He will pull at your heartstrings. He will offer you a deal. But you must not listen...
Alexandar doesn&apos;t... *ahem*... have it in him.
And so it is done. The elves will live, their Ancestor Trees will wither. A genocide averted, a balance restored. I must say I&apos;m quite pleased with myself.
That&apos;s very kind of you, but I have my own battles to wage, and you... Well, you have yours, don&apos;t you?
Water Summon
Tomb of Bromley
[IFAN] &lt;i&gt;Another &lt;/i&gt;bounty on my head.
Iron Bone
Eternal Cup
One of the few hopes that we got, that&apos;s what he was. He&apos;s Godwoken - one of them that could be the new Divine.
*She fidgets.*
Dungeon Door Open
*Say that he&apos;s free to leave if he wants. No need to be an ass about it.*
Who could blame you. The gods passed you over, after all.
*Accuse the voice of being the Devourer himself.*
Supercharger Scroll
What? I just made the device the Divine himself ordered, I swear! And as for &lt;i&gt;using&lt;/i&gt; it, that was all Lucian and Alexandar. I was &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;... Lucian knew &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;what he was doing.
Select
There&apos;s something to this candle, Lohse; let&apos;s see what can be done.
He&apos;s over yonder in the kitchen. The cook; the celery man; the butcher man, but but but he &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; things! If there&apos;s wolves on the prowl, Griff will have caught their scent.
*Ask him if he knew the people on those crosses.*
Nebora
Can&apos;t climb
Don&apos;t underestimate the power of true prayer! This is a place of incredible power, where a single prayer holds the weight of thousands. Your heart and soul will fill as quickly as they&apos;re drained.
Fine, then. But I&apos;ll be keeping my eye on you.
A barbed Elven spear, dried blood encrusted in every engraved rune.
Lizards are leashed to flame, in both life and death.
Lookie here, Beast. The queen paid me to do what I&apos;m told. She&apos;s not jabbering to the hired help about her schemes. You want to know what little I do? Then nab Mordus. Then we&apos;ll chat.
[BARBARIAN] *Tell her you intend to spill blood, with or without her help. Wouldn&apos;t it be easier if she just gives in?*
Dallis intends to take the Aeteran to Lucian&apos;s tomb beneath the Cathedral. She&apos;ll use it to purge his body.
*Glance at the knife and apologise for disturbing him.*
To be forgotten... truly the cruellest part of that dog Braccus Rex&apos;s punishment - every creature in the world should know and love the Princess!
*She responds with a pointed silence of her own.*
Anyway - you seem the sort that gets things done. So here&apos;s something you can get done: kill him, before he gets to me. There&apos;s a handsome reward in it for you.
[UNDEAD] *Tell him you&apos;re not much of a handshaker.*
One shudders to contemplate the sheer power of whatever thing or creature could humiliate the Seven Gods and leave them to perish.
*Tell him that he should stop painting for now and seek out a healer - he must have lost a lot of blood.*
Layali, the Wily One
*He pushes himself away from you, shouting soundlessly still. He rears back a fist, as though to punch you... but it&apos;s too late.*
*Say he seems awfully relaxed for someone who was just the target of an assassin.*
Ah. Better.
This is... distressing news. . I must send word. Quickly.
*Tell him the truth. You&apos;re a Sourcerer, recently escaped from Fort Joy. And he is...?*
R
...you doomed us all to this hell!
*Recoil from her black-nailed hand and tell her your name from a safe distance.*
I need to face this end alone.
*He rises and starts to dress. You follow suit.*
Though you are fire and I am ice, it pains me to be so wretched before you. Look not upon me, I beg.
Now we are free, and you shall die.
I am Baran Levere... I am Baran Levere... Not he! Not he! &lt;i&gt;I am Baran Levere...&lt;/i&gt;
Solve Carver&apos;s missing Magister problem.
Ah. Success!
*Decline his invitation and say you aim to leave immediately.*
Boots of the Pilgrim
Ah, sewers. How glamourous this life of adventure is...
Made it.
Ah. Pulling a lever invites magical translocation.
Increased resistances, Accuracy, Dodging. Protects against Diseased, Decaying, Petrified, Stunned.
We ought to be more careful, or we&apos;ll die in another ambush like this!
Stop this madness!
*Offer him two Void-tainted fish.*
You! Dead-walker! Tell me true: Stand you with the Source Hunters, or do you serve the tyrant Braccus Rex?
*Reach for your weapon. You&apos;re not in a talking mood.*
The Sallow Man, leader of the Black Ring on the Nameless Isle, is dead.
Increased Wits, protected from mind-controlling effects.
We escaped Fort Joy without finding Emmie.
Consumed Corpse
An Elven sword made in the signature style of Halla&apos;s warriors, each toothlike blade is thirsty for blood.
You! You&apos;re under arrest - and you better not try anything funny with me.
You ain&apos;t gettin&apos; out of these, beastie! Come on now, friend. Strike that pile o&apos;bones down.
&lt;b&gt;How she weeps! To offer her freedom, then renege? We could not have done better ourselves.&lt;/b&gt;
I am not the only of the Seven seeking a champion, my child. Your friends may have been similarly summoned by powers that threaten the very existence of our race.
Please - you must return the jar to me. You cannot understand the importance of this.
*She looks right through you, to her murderer. Her expression drowns in confusion and shock. Her knees buckle...*
I am talking about the war!
*So there she stood in the middle of nowhere? Ask what happened next.*
Mixed.
&apos;Closed due to nuptial obligations.&apos;
I am what you seek. &lt;i&gt;Find me.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrug. If he forgets he saw you, you didn&apos;t see anything at all.*
Creak-click-bang! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Stone Lid
I&apos;m impressed. It seems I have chosen well.
*She gives you the same cool, steady look. You turn away.*
&apos;Rewarded in this life and the next.&apos; Knowing Dallis, that means a golden coffin awaits the fellow that finishes the job.
I made it to the Wellspring. Dallis and Vredeman stole the powers of the Gods and left the island crumbling.
*You&apos;ve changed your mind. Leave the fantatic alone.*
Someone&apos;s already pillaged this pumpkin&apos;s treasures.
*Say you will fight to claim your place as the champion.*
[LIZARD] *The House of Dreams taught a charm for this sort of occasion. Recite what you can remember.*
[BEAST] *Apologise for the lie. You will see to Justinia&apos;s future safety. You owe her - and him - that much.*
You&apos;re wrong.
[ELF] *Move in close and lick his hand before he can protest.*
The Fanatic
Climbable Rock
Indeed. So, did you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; something, or...
Curious.
Did he help the elves to reclaim the forests? Did he lead the world or did he wander the wilderness?
So this. This is how you repay me. After everything I&apos;ve done for you.
*Tell the dwarf to back off. Ifan&apos;s already got more than enough work.*

Deal with the fugitive Lich.
What I meant was that, &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; authority, I shouldn&apos;t be under &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; thumb. I had thought that was perfectly obvious.
Gargoyle Statue
Before I do so however, I ask you in earnest: are you truly alright? I can only imagine how you must feel now that you&apos;ve slain the prey you hunted for years.
Well... we&apos;re in short supply of rangers, as it were... who did you have in mind?
Combat Mutators
I seem to have made it.
[1] shares [3] with [2]
Well, not all people are &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;, are they, hon. Your kind, for example. Now get your lying wooden tongue away from my bar, or I&apos;ll have the Magisters drag you straight to Fort Joy, where you belong!
*Retort that you generally prefer to be &lt;i&gt;friends &lt;/i&gt;with your friends.*
*Tell her you&apos;re stronger than she is. If you wanted to, you&apos;d put a stop to her right now. But you haven&apos;t.*
Masked Servant
You&apos;re so cool. But why is your face all covered up like that? Can I see? Can I, can I?
Lohse
That was naught but a whisper on the wind! A vile rumour-
Find Gareth.
Electrified Blood Cloud
*Insist. You want nothing to do with him.*
Boat
&apos;ullo scary!
Don&apos;t speak too soon. You&apos;re a god now, after all. Soon enough your brain&apos;ll be full of all the fates of all the people in all the realm.
You already know the terms. Nothin&apos; else to say.
Two empires, tooth and claw! Humans and lizards, fighting since the dawn of time...
Antique traders outside Lord Kemm&apos;s house are waiting for Cat, a notable appraiser.
Hardy wayfarers will wax lyrical on the many esoteric uses of garlic. Truth is, they just like the taste of it roasted.
Your courage in the face of danger is inspiring, my friend. Lucian guided your blows rightly!
[SCHOLAR] *Chant a psalm for the exorcism demons. &lt;i&gt;As ice melts before fire, so he perishes in Divinity&apos;s presence!*&lt;/i&gt;
Warrior&apos;s Helm
[VILLAIN] *Kill him and take his sword.*
A real live troll! I&apos;d dreamt of this day, and now it&apos;s... gone.
Fer the best, don&apos;t ya think? Sometimes, ya just need to let sleepin&apos; hounds lie.
How could he do such a thing? &lt;i&gt;I LOVED HIM!&lt;/i&gt;
*You see the soul of a murderer - an elf who specialised in abducting and disposing of lizard youths. His flame dances wildly, terrified you will snuff him out.*
Good sir, I really must protest! He and I, we are each other&apos;s soul mates, bound to one another by prophecy and dream! We &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; become one, it is... inevitable.
Betrayal. I shouldn&apos;t be surprised, and yet...
Changes Incarnate&apos;s element to acid, unlocking Poison Dart and Acid Spores.

*He turns to his master...*
Squeak?
Grenade Terror
Automaton Protector
*Giants; acorns; shields? Tell him you&apos;ve no idea what he&apos;s talking about.*
Really? Well perhaps that says more about the calibre of their intellect than anything else. Such a device would be a gross overconcentration of power - it could purge the entire world of all Source... luckily the laws of the universe render such a thing impossible.
Rich-smelling and supple, these leather strings could hold something together.
Well. If Kemm sent you, then I trust your judgement. Paladins - come. Give this man space.
*The Doctor nods at your own right hand. You raise it - and discover that the mark has re-appeared.*
Undead Lizard Ranger
*He smiles and shakes his head as you approach. Your eyes join, and memories of that night flood your mind.*
As slaves their servants often are portrayed...
Old Backpack
*Say that it&apos;s charged, and ask what to do next.*
*Tell her that you met Alexandar upon the island. You and Gareth fought against him.*
But let&apos;s try not to send too many of her kin after her.
*Though your spell tore through him like a spear through flesh, Tir-Cendelius looks grimly happy - if haggard.*
Ever the gentleman, my child. You have already done so much for us, although you may not know it.
*Well, this is awkward. Tell him he is, er, &lt;i&gt;dead.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Fane looks confused for a moment and rummages about for his notebook.*
Thank the sweet Divine for that, you were really getting on &apos;y tits. Wait, I don&apos;t have tits.
I don&apos;t need advice - not from Rhalic&apos;s little lapdog.
*The wind of the voices enters you as you and Saheila breathe together. It travels down your throat, into your belly, around your heart.*
Healer!
*Shriekers. Tell him Almira thanks him for the warning.*
