I joined... this order to serve the Divine. He would not... would never... accept this torture. It is... slavery! I serve the Divine. Not his son.
&lt;i&gt;My &lt;/i&gt;ma beat a Voidwoken. She&apos;s the strongest in the world.

Nothing - she just keeps spitting out her name and rank. Having her leader lying next to her must have hardened her resolve. She&apos;ll talk eventually, if she has any sense...
Can you just &lt;i&gt;not?&lt;/i&gt;
*With a jerk, your mind is pulled to a beautiful palace court. It&apos;s filled with cheers, but you can almost taste the fear in the room.*
*The other spirits watch you, wary and unable to hide their interest.*
Good. But you must be wary, and take heed.
*To your surprise, the rat listens intently as you recount your time in Fort Joy, and your escape into the Hollow Marshes.*
*Wink and say that you&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;&apos;take care&apos; &lt;/i&gt;of Peeper.*
I don&apos;t want to hear your lies, lizard. War is coming and you and your kind will pay for your deceit. Until then, good day.
The tales do him no justice. He was cruel, greedy, and stripped this land of all life. He was truly a horror.
Heh, trust. Do you remember trust, Quercus? I&apos;m not sure I do.
Unpleasant, but necessary.
Welcome, Godwoken... to your grave. I promise you... decay.
More than anything else, we must grow in power, that is: find Masters of the Source.
*Tell him that&apos;s for the best. You never were much interested in minor people.*
I&apos;m on watch here. Keep your mouth shut or bugger off.
If you are deemed to be pure, then the statue will allow you to pass, unhindered.
[HERO] *You can tell she was hurt. Ask gently who hurt her...*
Use... it... well...
*The room fades, but Amadia&apos;s moon remains, now emblazoned on the altar before you.*
*Relief flows through you as realisation grows - you may leave.*
*Nod with a smile. She&apos;s all his.*
You! You&apos;re not welcome here!
[BARBARIAN] *Grunt. There are now a million voices in your head, all saying the same thing: &apos;SMASH!&apos;*
*As High Priestess, remark that she must be the person to see about all matters related to the Cathedral.*
Delorus set off alone. His chances of survival are slim.
*Say you&apos;ve heard of a savage group of mercenaries who go by that name.*
*The image strains and flickers again. Each time it comes into focus, a dull ache squeezes your head like a vice. Tighter, tighter, unbearably tight...*
*Ask when a little slapfight became a criminal offence.*
Reduces the damage from Shadow attacks.
*Ahem* Right, then. Good day!
Sebille! You killed the Mother! We are free. We may go where we please.
Empty Soul Jar
And I can set &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; free in return. Say your prayers while you&apos;ve breath to speak them, lass. The Halls await...
*Cough awkwardly. Yes, it&apos;s just a bad dream. You&apos;re sure she&apos;ll wake up soon...*
*This is too much to bear! You could never kill your true love. &lt;i&gt;Consume him.*&lt;/i&gt;
Splendid!
This skill receives high ground bonuses regardless of elevation.
We made it out. They could have too. In the world of the Divine Order, only the strong survive.

How curious. Let us hurry, I should like to find the entity responsible for this.
Chain Armour
No - !
*The Meistr slams her hand on the table, sending the bowl and medical supplies bouncing.*
Enjoy your stay, half-knee.
I see it. Before my eyes.
Lucian is the key. The Seven may be dead, but their essence still lives within his rotting corpse. When the God King claims that final pearl of Divinity, his reign will begin!
Pyromancer Guardian
Keep memories of Lucian close. His image and words will cradle you.
But I don&apos;t want to be the Voidwoken. I&apos;m ALWAYS the Voidwoken!
I shall draw you back to the waking world as soon as you are ready.
That&apos;s... easier said than done, I&apos;m afraid. M-much easier said.
Find the cow reversal potion.
*Lean in to hear what eldritch message the ghost might have for you.*
Deal [1]. Infect a target with a disease that will spread to other nearby characters. Diseased characters deal reduced damage with all attacks and have lowered Constitution.
Alexandar imprisoned his Godwoken rivals, that he alone may claim Divinity.
*The dwarf turns away from you without a word.*
That was your last mistake!

Woof!
Your party leader is already speaking to someone. You can continue when your leader is ready.
My vigil is eternal. It won&apos;t cease until I&apos;m convinced - truly convinced - something might change for the better. For now, we remain as we must, stuck between action and inaction. Watching. Waiting.

&apos;tis a pity he did not live to see the Covenant kept. To feel his own pale marrow drained from his brittle bones.
There are ruins in the marshes: stonework vultures that perch above the king&apos;s long buried treasure.

Oh come now, I already gave you what&apos;s likely the most powerful weapon that was ever created - what else could I possibly do to help? You need to find Braccus and Dallis now.
*Say you learned something from the dead man&apos;s memories. He met an older woman on the ship.*
Some Seekers were healed. Others succumbed to their wounds.
|Lungs of Steel|
Have they? Then you are a harbinger of good fortune, not falsity.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast behind, and with it the burning chest.
THOU ART A... &lt;i&gt;THIEF.&lt;/i&gt;
Oooh, thanks missus! I&apos;ll go find her then! Mum! Mum! I&apos;m coming!&lt;br&gt;
I have more work to do, more Magisters to rid the world of. I can&apos;t leave any loose threads.
And who would&apos;ve thought it? You&apos;re sure not the collared landlubber I first met, that&apos;s for sure! You belong to Rivellon now.
He was born with an elf&apos;s luck as they say.
*He barks a laugh, teeth bared.*
Good. It is proper that the Godwoken should not be so easily pushed away. Too many are not ready for the trials ahead.
*Tell her your business is just that. &lt;i&gt;Yours.*&lt;/i&gt;
Enough. Next time you try that, I won&apos;t be so nice about it.
I just wish- ... well, it&apos;s too late now.
Not dangerous? I&apos;d spit, had I the lips for it. Your gods will not see their treachery through this time.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him &apos;Home&apos; is the pet name of a special knife of yours. You&apos;ll give him the proper introductions.*
The corrupted Knight of Duna rages still.
*Tell him the Divine Order will strike him down without mercy if they see him with a Black Ring sword.*
*The nurse stares openly at you. His eyes are a pitiless black, like a hungry shark.*
*Change your mind. You must conserve your Source.*
Bark At The Rune: Masterwork Rune
During their lives, worshippers collect Source. When they die, the Gods feed from them. It&apos;s an ingenious system.
You again? Can a body not rest in peace?
The end is nigh. Do not fail us now!

*Shoo away the doped priest. She&apos;s not welcome here.*
*Remain silent.*
We were going to leave Arx... but after this, looks like we&apos;re better off staying. Inside those walls is as safe as it&apos;s going to get for us, it seems...
*You&apos;re done talking. Stamp him in the knee, breaking his leg.*
*Jahan takes a solemn pause before continuing.*
*Tell her to go on: That sounds exceedingly useful.*
Windego
Long ago, the scholar Fane discovered that the veil between the world and the Void was made of Source. Our Seven lords desired this power.
We&apos;re clear of the Fort; Beast will know where to continue his search.
*Ask who this Magister was to him.*
&lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
*Silently curse the praying Paladin...*
You&apos;re in the right place. But I&apos;d find another way to proceed, if I were you.
&apos;Here lies Old Lady Borris.&lt;br&gt;(No Spitting on This Grave.)&apos;
So was I. Thought these collars&apos;d take the zing out of &apos;em. But their stubborn down to their sap, they are.
*Stare blankly.*
*She grabs your hand enthusiastically and shakes it hard.*
Now I must wield what&apos;s left of my power, and become the one god, saviour of the kin and lord of Rivellon.
This isn&apos;t a zoo. Either buy somethin&apos;, or quit gawkin&apos;.
He turned on me. Only one reason for that, I reckon: the contract on my head...

Your best was not enough then, but perhaps it is now.

We showed the Necromancer Ring to the maze gargoyle. It thought we were Braccus Rex, and teleported us to the end of the maze.
But we need help still, or we perish here. Not only these people here, but &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of us.
I took no pleasure in it, but when Dallis wants it done, it gets done. If not by my hand, than another&apos;s.
*Chortle and say the feeling&apos;s mutual.*

I&apos;m not sure I understand what you&apos;re trying to say.
This letter led to a discussion in my parlour over brandy, nothing more.
Brother! Help me, please!

*Tell him that&apos;s no issue. You travel alone.*
The Nameless Isle awaits you, my child. Divinity will soon be yours.
My good, wonderrrrful, exquisite brother. Chosen of Tir-Cendelius. You bring drudanae, yes?
It &lt;i&gt;spoke&lt;/i&gt; to me, spoke right into my mind, like icy curling fingers of something beyond death, beyond reason. Intriguing. But as soon as I touched it, Dallis tightened her leash around me. Tightened it so&apos;s I could barely breathe.
*She curtsies.*
Hah! You&apos;re cute when you think anyone should take you seriously.
I&apos;ve seen what they do to people. Well...
Choose target to resurrect.
None of yours. Thank you! Bye bye.
The Seven saved our lives. It&apos;s past time we saved theirs.
But when they came for him, he conjured up all these monsters. The Magisters were too busy helping &apos;emselves to save me an&apos; my own. Murderin&apos; Sourcerer filth...
Battle Source Puppet
My word, the Red Prince! It really is you! I have a message for you, my lord, from none other than your most esteemed counterpart: the Red Princess herself.
Please gods help me!
*Refuse to be buried beneath her heartache and decide to wrestle yourself free from this reverie.*
At the time, of course, I couldn&apos;t have foreseen the adventure ahead, but now that it is quite over, I&apos;d like to renew the opportunity for you to become my slave!
I&apos;ve told you about her, haven&apos;t I? The secret of my soul! All my life I thought she was but a dream within a dream, but she is real. She is here. And I must go to her.
and
That matters not. All that matters is that it is returned here. Amadia requires it so.
