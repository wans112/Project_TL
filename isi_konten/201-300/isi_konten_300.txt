Demons? The shrubbery might look a bit menacing, but I don&apos;t think it poses any threat to life or limb. You should direct your inquiries to my wife. A green thumb is one of her few natural blessings.
Cleanses [1]
It&apos;s time. T-time to fight. We can do this.
Proclamation Offering Bounty for Alexandar&apos;s Killers
*Say that you want to know the exact same thing, and you intend to find out.*
And? You think we don&apos;t know about the place? Not much harm in it, as far as I can tell. Besides, my hands are already full. Let &apos;em smoke all they want, I say.
*The night was long, but you didn&apos;t sleep a wink. You lie in one another&apos;s arms basking in euphoric exhaustion.*
*Nod. Tell him you&apos;ll have a look around. Take your leave.*
Ore Vein
Hah! Collared like a dog! A very tall, very scaly dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
A note from Ryker directing you to a hatch in his study.
Spirit of Magister Brannt
Come and find me later in the Hall of Echoes - I believe I&apos;m rather close to having Anathema in working order...
*Tell him to wait five minutes, then climb the ladder, walk out of the house, keep walking, and never come back.*
Didn&apos;t you hear me, you snake-screwin&apos; monstrosity? Stay &lt;i&gt;away &lt;/i&gt;from my bar!
*Bid her farewell.*
Visit me sometime?
To a kingdom in need of justice.
*She pokes her finger in your direction.*
*Warn him that the tinkerer has a bomb.*
Now, be silent. Your questions vex me, and I have no time for idle chatter. Find the others, and gather near the flaming guardians. Should the hymn be sung, the vaults can be opened. We are not safe.
Sable
They&apos;re clever, these Voidwoken. Always annoying when something that tries to kill you is intelligent.
*Tell him you&apos;ll swear to all of them, if you can find them.*
There is no value in further debating the matter. Your time, and that of your passenger, has come to an end.
UI Select Slot1
I wish there were more I could do, but in this... condition, I fear I would be of little help.
Unnh!
You&apos;re gonna have to wait. Waiter &apos;n&apos; chef are both gone, those good-for-nothing sinners! I&apos;ve got more than enough on my plate - Lucian help me!
Welcome to Arx.
Time to show you what happens to thieves around here!
Gareth
*Well, you didn&apos;t think this conversation could get any more depressing, and yet here you here. Impressive, really.*
*Tell Exter to hold on; you are still being &lt;i&gt;watched.*&lt;/i&gt;
Headscarf
We&apos;ll eat your souls...
*Advise him to choose his words carefully, if he knows what&apos;s good for him.*
I... I fail her...? She is... gone?
Burro&apos;s Club
We entered the Academy - the first section of the Council of Seven. We must now find our way to the Arena of the One.
Now you must go back to your world, my chosen one, and make your escape from the piece of rock they landed you on.
Move along, shorty. We&apos;ve got our hands full enough as it is.
*Nothing happens.*
*The faint sound of an arrow being loosed echoes through the hall. Whatever force had been dragging the witch abruptly stops. She goes limp. The flames consume her.*
You seem different. Tell me, what have you learned? Or has the smoke simply addled your mind beyond repair?
*Ask what information he&apos;s already passed on to his superiors.*
Hmm. Now that you&apos;re here, can&apos;t very well leave. Suppose you told someone? Nah, that wouldn&apos;t do. Nah, you&apos;ll just have to die. I&apos;ll get my troll to do it.
*Tell her that you actually are here for her soup, and it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;delicious&lt;/i&gt;.*
Your turn! What&apos;s &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;honest opinion of &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
Stairs to the Secret Court
*Tell her you&apos;re here for Slane and you won&apos;t leave without a way to help him.*
There is great power in names. Just like Source is the language of creation, a demon&apos;s true name is the core of its existence. Its be-all... or end-all.
Hrrmph! I think not. Perhaps I should show to you just how far below me you stand in intellect... think of it as a lesson in humility.
Yeah. I see that now.
*Tell Gareth about your visit to the Hall of Echoes, taking care not to reveal too much about your true nature.*
We were on our way into town, like normal.
[NOBLE] [DWARF] *Sniff that you are not used to such treatment at the Queen&apos;s court.*
*Two...*
Ruins - Exterior C
Right Cmd
*Follow his anger back to the root.*
[SCHOLAR] *Wave your hands through the straws, showing it&apos;s all an illusion.*
I swear on Lucian himself, if you come near me again I will make a noose of your guts and hang you with it.
Demonic Blood
Awrite, human! Right glad Lohar ain&apos;t left us here to wither.
Friends, eh? Well, let&apos;s hit the road, friend. I&apos;m sensing we&apos;ll need to be good weapons out here.
Goodness. I&apos;ve met street urchins with more manners. I&apos;d think lizard royalty would have more respect for ceremony.
As a dark force approached, my god returned me to the ship. There, we found ourselves alone.
Set the painting in place.
Of course. Wherever there is sea, I will endeavour to bring you. Consult with your companions and set a course.
Charlie
Dirt Pile
Smellzzz &lt;i&gt;good.&lt;/i&gt;
A painting of a proud female lizard clad in dragon-like armour. The set appears to be made from massive bones.
It was like dying. I was all alone in the dark, in the deep, deep dark, and I suddenly knew as clear as day that I didn&apos;t exist, that no-one would ever know me and then...
[RED PRINCE] *Tell her not to be silly. You look dashing and she knows it.*
Spare me. You can search my soul all you want, you still don&apos;t understand. No-one understands.
Large Ruby
I&apos;ll have you know Lucian&apos;s Day is coming, and that I will pray for his return, but I will pray for your wicked soul as well! Now please leave us alone, you... you scallywag!
Character can no longer use magic.
*She pauses and tightens her lips. A moment passes. And then another. She smiles.*
*Very well then. Shrug and walk away.*
...&lt;i&gt;and who shall mourn me when I&apos;m gone?&lt;/i&gt;
The wisdom of the elders lives through me.
Can&apos;t say I&apos;ve given it much thought.
They got that arena down below the Black Bull. Guess some people like a little whackin&apos; time, if ya get my drift.
*The spirit frowns and points at its belly, then rubs it in a circular motion.*
I... I... but they&apos;re all like me. Every last one of them. How can I... how can I...
(end)
I pledge my life, O Lucian. Please return.
Hi.
Thank you, Godwoken. You have done me an unparalleled service, and you&apos;ve quite humbled me at the same time.
One more step!
You&apos;ve just received a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Teleporter Pyramid&lt;/font&gt;! These pyramids are &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/font&gt; to each other. Open your inventory and &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;use&lt;/font&gt; the Teleporter Pyramid to teleport to its partner.
Yes, the prime of Scions I am - when I have your heartless heart!
[SEBILLE] *Soothingly say you won&apos;t hurt him. But you&apos;ll gladly hurt the ones that hurt him.*
I do so enjoy being proven right.
You&apos;ll see me in Driftwood for cheap recipes? Um... free recipes? At least one free recipe? See me in Driftwood, we&apos;ll talk.
That - &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;won&apos;t be necessary, just see that it&apos;s done! By Duna&apos;s beard, these savages...
Assassin... Godwoken... the Void seeks you...
I get that ya gotta do what ya gotta do an&apos; I&apos;m not poundin&apos; down on a gavel and throwin&apos; ya into the brig for it.
My name is Hannag, portal-master of the House of Shadows. In life I did great deeds... some good, some bad.
Though I won&apos;t go so far as to deny absolute wealth has its perks. Absolute power for instance.
Toy Wooden Block
Not what I&apos;d choose for myself, but... you do you.
We heard a voice from a grave in the Stonegarden.
*For a moment, Isbeil appears almost... relaxed. Her eyes flash blue; her face quivers.*
There&apos;s only one reason you&apos;d come to Arx: You&apos;re looking for Justinia. Heed my advice and &lt;i&gt;leave &lt;/i&gt;this place before you do something stupid.
You better explain just what&apos;s going on in here before I throw you in the cells.
Well, that doesn&apos;t look ominous at all...
*Back off with your hands raised. You don&apos;t want any trouble.*
You prove nothing with this brutality!
A role I&apos;ll continue to play until the day I die, Your Majesty. I swear it!
PEEP!
The Doctor is no more - I felt his presence extinguish at last.
I find a thief!
*Tell the dog not to worry.*
...leave it to me, Lohse. Mama Malady will think of something.
The God King ascended to Divinity. Oops.
*Tell him you already have a job, and you&apos;re not looking for another one.*
Hear that, kid? We need to &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt;.
*Looking closer, you recognise the device she was working on. It is &lt;i&gt;identical &lt;/i&gt;to the portal you were given to save the elves... right before the Deathfog annihilated them.*
Cheese Bread
Boat first, questions later.
Bloodthirst
Objects
Look around. One enemy has incapacitated the others.
My mum! *Sniff.* Mummy.
You are mine and I am yours. You must follow me...
And me.
&apos;Here lies Jim Freel.&lt;br&gt;Taciturn in life. Silent in death.&apos;
Party Level
*Her cat&apos;s eyes close as she leans in for a kiss.*
An obsidian ritual knife. It thirsts for blood... yours.
*Wonder how they found out about these weapons.*
No longer the seat of the Divine, Arx was abandoned to the Deathfog and the dead.
*Ask why he settled on red alone.*
Life after death is the privilege of the favoured, darling. And to gain his favour, all he asks is but one gift.
Away! &lt;i&gt;Stay away from my child!&lt;/i&gt;
*Decline, and take your leave.*
Inert Idol
*It looks at you with its cold flat eyes as if to say &apos;what are you waiting for?&apos; Then it turns away and gets back to drowning in the sunshine and its own blood.*
They were led by a huge Voidwoken of the like I&apos;ve never seen - some winged horror. The last thing I saw were its talons coming for me...
I&apos;ll see you again, I hope. The company in here lacks a certain charm.
*Ask Fane what &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;wants.*
Welcome to Fort Joy, sister. Comin&apos; from our lands, are ye? Or were ye already set up in Divine Order-ville?
Someone killed Stingtail before Sebille could talk to him. She&apos;ll have to find a lead elsewhere.
Go on. &lt;i&gt;Devour me!&lt;/i&gt;
Enemies at the Gates
You&apos;re under arrest! Gotta take you to prison, though violent types like you belong in worse places...
Pleasure doing business with ya, guv&apos;nor!
[Among the many recommendations this city guide makes is a visit to the Kemm gardens, which is abloom with rare flowers and foliage, some with quite unusual properties. Sadly, it seems an invitation from lady Kemm may be required.]
Murga, the Shadowy One
*Bearing in mind Saheila&apos;s request, order him to hand over the drudanae. Perhaps it can secure Amyro&apos;s release.*
I&apos;ve lost too much time on that wastrel Braccus as it is! Take this proclamation and see that all hear of it - Princess Zenthia of the Firelands is free once more!
*He stares straight ahead, eyes unfocused, saying nothing.*
Not scared of a little elbow grease, are you? A girl ought to know how to put herself right. Go ahead and combine the mushroom with the vial.
*Place your hand on the thrumming jar to absorb the soul within.*
Caverns
Stern Letter from Siwan
*Change your mind again. Sure, you&apos;ll hear it.*
*Elaborate.*
Gaze into the gem, scaled one.
