for the sake of morale.
Until we meet again, daddy...
&lt;br&gt;~ Begin Fight ~&lt;br&gt;
So we begin. Remember, though I may be old, the riddle is new and may be... *ahem*... broken. Here we go.
This simple, gristly dish is considered a fine dessert among Dwarven circles.
*Draw your weapon. He won&apos;t rise this time.*
Rosie
*Your god stirs, pouring out of you as a thick steam, rushing towards Zorl-Stissa in a wave, dousing the flames as he goes.*
Talk to Malady.
I&apos;m off to Driftwood to get friendly with a very strong drink.
Wasn&apos;t her that failed her Lord. It was her Lord that failed her.
Mm-hmm. Yes. Yup. You ought to go s-see her. Dorotya. She can help - help! She can help you.
I&apos;m not getting into that boat with you!
Equipment
*Stay quiet and let the scene before you play out.*
*You hear small whimpering sounds from behind a basket. You peer behind it and find a small human child holding her knees and trembling.*
For me to help you, our souls must touch. And a kiss brings our souls closer, does it not? It shall fulfil both your desire... &lt;i&gt;and mine.&lt;/i&gt;
The elves may have made a terrible mistake.
Keep your skills sharp.
There may be another. If you find a Swornbreaker scythe, if you have any remaining mercy - bring it here.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell the cub it needs to learn fast.*
*You walk towards the figure on the dais, but wisps of mist start to cloud your vision. With each step, the mist gets thicker, hiding the figure from sight.*
*Recount the story of the rich elf living in the graveyard.*
This staff will keep the dead where they should stay: in the ground.
Thievery Required: [1].
Painted Plaice
One: Spooky magic. Two: Only half a demon, actually. My mother was a bitter elf named Loda. Three: Just a bit of leftover effluvia from the spell. Four: More than I can count. Five: Something too horrible to mention by the light of day.
Summon a poisonous slug at the target point. The slug can barf poison at your enemies.
What? But we came all this way!
We left as soon as we came - though it&apos;s no skin off my nose in any case.
Giant Thunder Rune
I bet you heard. I bet &lt;i&gt;everyone &lt;/i&gt;is talking about this cursed wedding.
The honour was mine. But there is still much to do. Alexandar thinks he is owed his father&apos;s title, yet barely deserves the crumbs of his father&apos;s plate. You can&apos;t let him rise.
Uncommon
Wind-Up Toy
I feel better all of a sudden... a weight&apos;s been lifted.
Gareth&apos;s returned to us... maybe we&apos;ll be able to get out of here alive after all...
[1] increases damage and Dodging when dual-wielding two one-handed weapons.
*Note her panic. Grave danger must wait within these vaults.*
Enchanted Leg Armour
*Tell Ifan he shouldn&apos;t have killed Alexandar. You specifically told him not to.*
Find Hannag.
YOU! You did... you did &lt;i&gt;what?!&lt;/i&gt; HENS! PECK!
Soon he&apos;ll be no more than a black name on my fair skin...
*Tell the pig you don&apos;t recall having met.*
Madness seemed to have quite taken it. There was nothing for us to do but put it down.
Goat.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell the dwarf that&apos;s preposterous. Ifan is your manservant!*
Vengeance can only serve one... but we should make haste away from this place, before Dallis and her red dogs try to reclaim me.
Black Ring Orders
Then we should get to know each other a little better. Allow me: I am the Doctor. I am extremely powerful. Just as you are. Together the world is ours. You should listen to me.
Do we know each other? I feel like we&apos;ve dated.
&lt;i&gt;I KIIIIIIIILL YOU, SNAKE-MEAT!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him Reimond can go to hell and so can he.*
Shiny as a button, this ball could be a potential deadly weapon in the wrong hands.
*Nod. You&apos;d love to hear it!*
*Tell her it isn&apos;t going well. You haven&apos;t met anyone who can help you.*
There WILL be justice!
He&apos;s powerful Sourcerer. Lives here in the garden. Can take the &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; from you. No brain, just body. My mind isn&apos;t big. But it&apos;s still mine.
Signs of Resistance
Brother Amant... bless your spirit...
I&apos;ve seen it. I won&apos;t let it happen again.
Pain_Lg_2
Try as he might, he couldn&apos;t take it with him.
Which is only appropriate. This is, after all, a wine to die for.
*The spirit vanishes with a pitiful moan.*
Quit Game
Enter, then. Keep respect.
*The Meistr rests her hand on her arm, where one of her wounds has just reopened. She squeezes hard, ignoring the trickle of blood running down her claw.*
Corpse Leech
*Say she&apos;s right. You&apos;ll help her kill the Master first.*
Veiled Undead
Mind you, being torn asunder by a Voidwoken would be even more inconvenient, so if you wouldn&apos;t mind...
*Look to the ground. You&apos;re sorry to have to bring the bad news, but Verdas died in Fort Joy.*
It&apos;s... whispering. Makeitstopmakeitst-&lt;i&gt;ARGH!&lt;/i&gt;
All that you want...
*Ask who he is.*
*Question Meistr Siva - is she &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;this is the only way?*
*Take your leave.*
Think now of what will happen when I lick you all over.
[1] was [2]
&lt;i&gt;Exactly.&lt;/i&gt;
Stay your weapon, and I will reward you in turn. I only wish to regain what was taken from me. &lt;i&gt;Let me eat&lt;/i&gt;.
*His voice calms; his face relaxes.*
*The list in the records is a long one. It bears many familiar names - people you met, people you fought, people who were kind to you. Most, it seems, you will never see again.*
I thought you&apos;d forgotten about me, darling. How goes your little endeavour?
I hope I get a nice burial, once the Doctor is finished with me...
[DWARF] *Ask if Griff won&apos;t be angry to see her selling to a dwarf.*
I&apos;m somewhat of an expert on the subject of disease. Like all Black Ring agents, Isbeil was a tumour needing to be excised from Rivellon.
We&apos;ll go back to the city. Its walls are the best protection we can muster for now.
Like I said, we&apos;ll speak of this after the lesson. First I need you to prove you have it in you to slay one of these horrors.
The world is mine. There is just one small detail I need to take care of...
*Tell him he&apos;d catch more flies with honey than vinegar.*
An entire island, consumed by fire... not something you see every day... not something you&apos;d &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to see every day.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; . . . G O D W O K E N .&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that she&apos;s been slacking: you&apos;ve been hired to fetch a progress report.*
I have not. But how fortuitous it is indeed for a slave girl to walk on by and confirm a Dreamer&apos;s presence on this isle.
We communed with the spirit of Syrus Oates. Burned alive by the Lone Wolf Pigsbane, Oates refused to scream. He wants Pigsbane dead.
Very funny, sire. But in this particular case, there is a real answer to be had.
How gratifying to know I amuse you...
The Divine Order&apos;s all that stands between you and a Voidwoken&apos;s throat. If you&apos;re against the Order, sir, you&apos;re a traitor to us all.
*Ask what led to this terrible scene.*
I know you will. This world might be filled with murderous giants, but at least some of them are worth saving.
Fancy Pants
Let&apos;s get this over with.
Handsmash
Astarte&apos;s Tears
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without indulging in Driftwood&apos;s more exotic fare.
*Tell him you know he&apos;s been hunting Scions. Ask him why.*
Forgive me, Tarlene...
Old Lady&apos;s House
Water drips constantly from the end of this wand, a steady trickle that draws blossoms and shrubs forth from the path you walk.
*He turns to you, Lohse at his side. Her eyes are dark, her grin cruel as she hunches at his side.*
Theft of the Tyrant
Now now. No sense in hiding.
Nothing to be concerned with, I assure you. Mere husks.
*Bahara yells &apos;Forward!&apos; pushing you savagely towards the light. Then the tendrils have her and she screams. Never has there been a crueller silence.*
*Explain that his contract is long gone.*
[RED PRINCE] *Tell her that you&apos;re a lizard prince, exiled from his own realm. Frightful bother, that.*
*Touch the warm coat of wax tarnishing the mosaic.*
Will there be anything else?
Hush? You pitiful woman. Do you truly expect me to be &lt;i&gt;silent?&lt;/i&gt;
*Quietly wait as the squirrel muses on.*
Yes, she is our mother of magic - the font from which all such power flows. Legend says that she lay with a mortal man, and their issue became the wizards of this world.
Water Resistance Potion
*Offer her your condolences.*
Come. Walk on. Witness his majesty.
Shadow Essence
Hnuh?!
*Point out that he can&apos;t escape his flesh and blood - he is who he is.*
[LOHSE] *Hint that for some of your sins you are not... entirely... responsible.*
Crafting Bible, Part X
*Grip the spirit&apos;s hand all the tighter.*
An evil-smelling arrowhead that fizzes and hisses beneath its venomous coating; try not to inhale as you craft with it.
*Lady Kemm responds to your insult with a cocked head and a crooked smile.*
Brahmos&apos; Blade
You glow with Divine grace. May you absolve us our sins, as he has absolved yours.
*Tell Han you&apos;re keen to find this safe place.*
*Tell her you ran into one of her sisters in Driftwood.*
Easy to say; hard to do when you haven&apos;t slept in a three days! I just hope the Reds take her soon - put us both out of our misery.
One less Magister for me to kill. Good.
*He stands stock-still and doesn&apos;t make a sound.*
*Ask if he has any goods for sale.*
Well... it&apos;s your funeral. Try not to let her use Sourcery on you, I&apos;d like to avoid having Voidwoken show up. And do watch out for the lava. That&apos;s instant death.
I&apos;m not so easily swayed, fool.
Fulfill the contract on Dorian Gall.
Shadow Tiger
*You&apos;ve heard enough. Turn away and leave this poor head alone.*
Source makes for an excellent ally in matters of a demonic nature. The Voidwoken may no longer seep through the Veil, but the beasts of Nemesis remain another matter.
Go ssserve your God and King, you ssscum.
Cat Burglar
*Tell them you can always keep the potion.*
*Inform them that Mordus is dead.*
*Demand to know why she was keeping this from you.*
*She approaches you, the vines on her armour lashing as her voice becomes a chorus.*
Damned rat. Least they&apos;re not all gone feral - you seem a decent sort.
Some scouts told me there was a Godwoken headed this way.
An assassination attempt! The House of Shadows pursues me still.
What is it now?
Parchment
The shield has seen many battles, but each scratch has just revealed more of the brilliant gold hidden beneath its paint.
So he is! I guarded his library like a griffin would a princess&apos;s bedchamber, and look where it got me!
Tsk. I&apos;d expect a little more concern for all those kids out there. Impressionable minds. Easy to seduce, easy to manipulate.
We found evidence of smuggling in Driftwood. The Divine Order will be interested. The smugglers will want their secret kept.
*Woof! Woof woof!*
But...
Rush forwards in a straight line to a point far away, hitting all enemies in your path with [1] damage. Creates Frozen surfaces.
until they succumbed to the ravages of time.
*The girl&apos;s grip tightens. A flush of colour spreads across her previously bloodless features. She&apos;s grown stronger... strong enough to move, perhaps.*
Woof!
*React with anger of your own. How dare she take pleasure in vast suffering?!*
*As you approach the unsmiling Magister, Ifan catches your arm and speaks to you with some urgency.*
