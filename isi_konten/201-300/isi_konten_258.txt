All my life has been a lead up to this: to be king of kings; god of gods. &lt;br&gt;
&apos;Operator was identified as most likely primary threat. Extirpation was deemed the safest and most logical action.&apos;
[VILLAIN] *Urge the dwarf to focus: surely he remembers killing those other dwarves? Killing his brothers in cold blood?*
[OUTLAW] *Remark on the graves Gareth fills. A deserved fate, surely?*
You&apos;re under arrest! The world doesn&apos;t need more liars and thieves. Something to think about in your prison cell.
The Destroyer&apos;s Gloves
*Tell her to reconsider. You can&apos;t let her ascend in your place.*
Do not let pride stand between you and redemption.
Anssswer the quessstion. &lt;i&gt;Do you ssserve the God King?&lt;/i&gt;
They deserve that much.
*Confidently hold your bag open for inspection.*
We been here longer than normal.
We fought with Sech Zapor, but the captain summoned a skeletal crew to distract us while he made his escape.
Move the target(s) to your inventory
*Demand that he set you and your people free!*
*He claps you on the back heartily. A little &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; heartily, as it feels like one of your lungs has just dislodged itself.*
*Attempt a bribe.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*You run. You run with all you have. The red eye widens; a solitary sun. Run, red, run, then WHITE!*
Oh, but this is destiny! I too name my knives! And my shears and my pliers and my scalpels! Oh, dearrr little thing, I&apos;d like to lick you all over with my studded tongue.
Well! That&apos;ll teach me to second-guess a magicockerel.
Absolutely! Special prices for you, my friend...
Isbeil. I&apos;ve not known you to be so... &lt;i&gt;welcoming&lt;/i&gt; to strangers.
Owning a heart is a glorious thing.
That&apos;s the idea, at least. But we need to move quickly. The faster we can get in and out of there, the less chance there will be that Adramahlihk realises we&apos;re there. So. Are you ready?
Heh. No, but you are not the only Godwoken, blessed one.
It was a dream. It had to be a dream...
You did save me, didn&apos;t you? How aggravating...
*An acid joy assaults your senses as the Sallow Man devours the memories of the Bishop Divine, the son of Lucian, the Godwoken who shall never be Divine... and you realise that Sallow is not a man...*
Dodging and movement speed increased for allies around you.
Second verse, same as the first.
Steel yourself. A trying battle awaits.
*Fold your arms and stare at her with an eyebrow arched.*
All that Deathfog.
Before I lose my temper.
Mystical Small Venom Rune
Just like you, Sebille, to gloat over a god. But that pretty smile of yours will &lt;i&gt;melt&lt;/i&gt; from your face when you face the Void!
*Resist the vision. You want it out of your head!*
It&apos;s where it always is... Lohar &lt;i&gt;did &lt;/i&gt;send you, right?
Alexandar will see that Source users get what they deserve. Dallis makes them silent, obedient. And if they&apos;re truly lucky, they become even... more.
Mind your business.
Another one? How many more could there be?
I want no trouble from you. This job is dull and I&apos;d like to keep it that way.
*Shake your head. She&apos;s clearly lying; she wouldn&apos;t participate if she didn&apos;t know the purpose.*
*After a bit of tinkering, the machine whines pitifully, and the shield surrounding the cell flickers off.*
*Say you met Rhalic, and he taught you how to grant blessings.*
(end)
A thief. One who believes the world is theirs and theirs alone - one who&apos;d starve another for a fourth meal.
*Tell them the good news - you found the potion.*
Find another way to help the cows return to human form.
I am Jahan. Above all I am a demon hunter; underneath it all I am what those with a flair for hyperbole call a Master of the Source.
*She looks at you with hard eyes that soften into a smile. She punches your arm lightly.*
*Each of the four dials bears four phrases that can be rotated into place...*
Immune To Freezing
Slaver of the Seas. Think he picked that name out of a lucky bag?
*Toyseller Sanders cringes and raises his arms to shield himself - but it&apos;s too late.*
*Nod. You&apos;re ready.*
Disgusting how they keep our kind trapped here. We are the most powerful beings in all of Rivellon. Braccus Rex knew that, and he populated this cavern with the bodies of those who stood in his way. &lt;i&gt;Our &lt;/i&gt;way.
If not for you I would be truly alone. Thank you for that.
Hmm. People say that.
Ohngh, the heavens...
It is no small thing to ask. But it is your duty.
Shabby Statue of Tyran
A party member
The war. The elves that the Order killed. Oh, gods, it&apos;s furious-
(end)
Your Majesty. This course is wise. The queen needn&apos;t explain it to one who would see it all undone.
*Sigh* There is no doubting that, is there...?
My father concocted this charm so that he could face the Sallow Man in battle. The cowl has now been laced with its essence - wear it, and he will be forced to reveal himself.
The mummified leg of the long-dead Anorion. Oil appears to have been used to preserve the ancient flesh.
Radeka the Witch
*She seems very focused on this vault. Ask why she&apos;s so interested in it.*
*Lohse glares as you pass, her mouth set to a frown.*
Very well: in that case we&apos;ll forego the gallows and turn straight to the hunt! A would-be Magister has to prove his killer instinct after all.
I  remember &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;feeling. All too well.
Expensive Wine
*She turns to go.*
Most foreboding... when did heroes turn villains? And what is this &apos;Covenant&apos;?
*The familiar stone figure is a welcoming sight in the unwelcoming gloom.*
What a happy day, to see Gareth returned!
Find another kin dreamer.
Report back to the Warden.
And you in me.
Witching Trousers
Green Ring
Enough talk. You clearly aren&apos;t listening!
Upon his death from food poisoning all three of his followers committed suicide.
Thrumming with power, this iridescent key almost hurts to look at for too long.
Consult Brahmos the Wanderer.
And here, in their own land, something tried to hang the Seven.
*Rest your hand on his shoulder. Whatever about the past, this is his world now.*
Malady took the ship into the Hall of Echoes and saved us all.
*Tell him you don&apos;t have time for a sob story.*
*He sniffs the wind, gazing out across the dilapidated buildings of Fort Joy as if looking for something.*
Fooled you.
Incompatible
*A lizard, tall and beautiful, turns towards you. Her eyes widen...*
[SEBILLE] *Wink and accept his offer. You&apos;ll take all the help you can get.*
Stay back, Sourcerer. And stay silent. Our Godwoken speaks.
Ho! A right disgrace, you are! Come on, you remember... &apos;Grab a bottle o&apos; air-oh, fill it up to the brim! Stick your sorrows in there-oh, &apos;n&apos; drown &apos;em &apos;til they swim!&apos;
Look at him! Have you ever seen anything more magnificent?
*Take a breather. What did he want from you again?*
*Seeming surprised, Ifan gladly takes the drink from your hands and downs a hefty glug.*
Saheila. You speak to her? She is all right, then. Good.
Mysterious Cave
Origin:
Thief! Dreams in ruins! THIEF, Mother, THIEF! Answer me, Mother!
Yes, he resides here for a time. He and his troupe commandeered the top level of my temple.
Drop your weapon! D-drop it!
My mind is very busy. You may rest here, but please keep to yourself.
Then let us proceed.
Groom&apos;s Diary
Veerle, the Avid One
Journal Updated
*Say that he&apos;s a salesman, isn&apos;t he? If he didn&apos;t want people perusing his establishment, he should have done a better job of keeping it secure.*
*Thank him for the information.*
Ryker now. Nice guuuuy. Gives me beeeeets.
Spirit of a Deer
I attacked Sadha. The Red Prince wasn&apos;t happy.
Ah! Well, when you put it like that, I couldn&apos;t possibly deny you the gift of verse!
*Say you prefer to decimate the battlefield, causing maximum damage along the way.*
We found the entrance to the archives.
I&apos;m grateful for your kindness. I needed time to think. My parents led good lives. I&apos;d rather celebrate them for the love they gave me than to wail over their loss.
Things are stacked against us as it is without adding him back into the mix - if we see him, I say we ought to kill him.
The queen&apos;s paranoia is boundless. There is only one voice she heeds: Isbeil&apos;s. Isbeil demanded a wedding contingent, and so it was done. Good thing we were here, too; the Void sent some uninvited guests.
Poisoned Cup of Orange Juice
How?
The Eternal spoke of a strange Source-consuming device called &apos;The Aeteran&apos;.
And please, do not assume that I &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;you. Time is a more reliable assassin than any cut-throat. I can wait.
I wonder what old Grog is up to these days?
*Catch her up on your deeds of derring-do.*
Don&apos;t let this moss muncher talk to you like that. &apos;Specially a &lt;i&gt;cheapskate &lt;/i&gt;like this&apos;n. Griff already knows she don&apos;t like to pay her fair share.
Have hope, kin. The Mother Tree suffers. But the elves endure.
*He squints at you. He withdraws the key.*
Huge Air Resistance Potion
*Flash an intimidating smile. If they think Braccus was bad, they should see &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;curses...*
*The beat builds into a riot of sound, her hands and feet moving in an inscrutable pattern. She takes a deep breath and starts humming above the rhythm, a sound like a train, like a flock of birds, like nothing else.*
3
*Thank him for his kind devotion.*
Deep down someone like Dallis only trusts herself. I wonder if that new advisor of hers realises that.
Aye, stay, but do keep &lt;i&gt;quiet&lt;/i&gt;, the lot of you!
When I notch your number here on my leg, I&apos;ll do so with respect.
Aye, some bloody help yeh were! Get away from us!
The Gods choose &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;as their champion. Some tired old mercenary.
Gossips. Meddlers. Interfering families. And now Voidwoken as well, tearing the place asunder. They&apos;re welcome to the lot as far as I&apos;m concerned. We&apos;re going far away from it all.
Why did you do it?
Ifan revealed Ryker&apos;s Lone Wolf connections.
Decaying Limb
I fear that they are lost. But I thank you for your kindness. I shall pray for your deliverance and for theirs.
Deal with Withermoore&apos;s lance.
*She nips and kisses newly exposed flesh all over your body, running her mouth from your neck to your belly button, down to your shins, up to your thighs.*
We escaped the Merryweather as it sank, only to be drowned at sea. Or so it seemed...
I would&apos;ve seen them all gone black as night if it meant a chance at killing this demon.
*The creature looks at you blankly. Its lips have been sewn shut in painfully tight, even stitches.*
*Tell her you don&apos;t know what she&apos;s talking about.*
I&apos;m talkin&apos; here.
If I knew the way, I&apos;d shout until every god heard me. But I have no idea - I simply want this to end.
Ain&apos;t got the coin fer a poem? Join the club, sister. Not like it&apos;s rainin&apos; gold &apos;round here.
*She opens her eyes and turns to you...*
*Tell her she and her people did pretty well themselves.*
Incandescent Decapitator
Thou have neither three ticks nor two, but a single second to vacate, prickmedainty.
Bloodrage
*Take pity. Give him his ring.*
I have slept in your absence, Your Highness, but the fog has returned. Sadly, I see no more...
*Ros taps his foot impatiently and steals a glance at his half-packed boxes.*
[OUTLAW] *Wince. If they want information, gold would buy more than torture.*
Magister Alise
