Another one? How many more of you can Lady K possibly take in?
Something&apos;s wrong - my puppet&apos;s are unsettled!
Yes, a vile little tinkerer, goes by the name of Higba. Three of my Magisters have gone missing of late, from right here in Driftwood. All signs are that Higba is responsible.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The Advocate is dead. The Doctor is in... The Advocate... Advocate... Adv... Adv...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
I have a bad feeling about this place.
Oh, it was devastating, to be sure. But what good does mourning do, for either the living or the dead? I found a spot of fortune in the flames. It would be wrong to squander it, yes?
And here I thought ya had yer head on straight. Make sure they&apos;re free to fight. Then we&apos;ll chat.
*Offering advice to the forest traveller, Huwbert warns the unwary of the potential presence of moving mounds of vegetation. Malevolent shrubbery, he says, can make a poor end of a nightâ€™s sleep at camp - its bark is definitely as bad as its bite.*
[ELF] *No. You&apos;ll tear the secrets from his sallow sinews. Send the Sallow Man to his maker.*
Sunny Dry
It isn&apos;t that. Never mind. Let&apos;s just... we should keep moving.
Hot Kettle
Knights don&apos;t have &lt;i&gt;parents&lt;/i&gt;, ogre! We only have SWORDS!
Quicksave failed!
EAT ITS EYES.
*With his eyes closed in terror, he mutters to himself.*
This key unlocks the master bedroom in Ryker&apos;s opulent mansion.
*She&apos;s a spirit now? Ask what happened to her plan of going to the Hall of Echoes.*
[BARBARIAN] *Tell her you need no home save the tree canopy above.*
*Ask if that&apos;s a good thing.*
*The woman watches you leave through rheumy eyes and nods to herself.*
[RED PRINCE] *Say you won&apos;t fall for a succubus again. You must politely decline her advances.*
Everything&apos;s under control here, you can move on into the city.
Good thing we get to make our own choices and live our own lives. Damned if we&apos;ll be bound by the skies.
*Hand the relic to the priestess.*
He knew that his mortal remains would hold great power. The servants of the Void would naturally seek this power. We can never allow the Black Ring to lay their hands on his remains.
Swear your companions to the God King... or purge them.
Think on it: gods reduced to snarling beasts, so starved of Source it made them rabid.
We found Godwoken, housed them, fed them. I loved them like family. I was... naive.
*The spirit takes in the damage surrounding him and shakes his head.*
Myra
No shield equipped&lt;br&gt;
Hold on. You&apos;re the thug everyone&apos;s talking about, aren&apos;t you?
I&apos;ve missed you.
*Disagree. No-one should be exempt from the law, least of all those who claim they should be.*
*He nods a greeting, then returns to his watch.*
A headstrong and thoughtless girl, but the experience was - *cough* - was quite educational.
To open a locked door or chest, you can find the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;key&lt;/font&gt;, use a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;lockpick&lt;/font&gt;, or employ &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;brute force&lt;/font&gt;. If you are &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Undead&lt;/font&gt;, you can pick locks with your bony fingers.
Die_Magic_Acid_2
*Tarquin&apos;s jaw tightens.*
*The spirit is clearly far gone. Drain its Source.*
I wasn&apos;t totally sure we were even friends, honestly. It... means a lot to me to hear you say that.
Is that so? Must have been someone else...
I would normally employ a tool to delicately, but viciously, rip the face from the body.
Find the Mother. Curse her very &lt;i&gt;heart.&lt;/i&gt;
Cloak And Dagger Skillbook
But we understand not!
*Protest. You&apos;re as innocent as a spring flower.*
Keeping watch over your bounty, I take it.
What do you want, ben-Mezd?
Rat
Besides, there are far worse fates Braccus Rex could have visited upon you. This island itself is proof enough of that, I dare say.
*Zaleskar clucks in disapproval, a sound like pulled teeth rattling about a glass.*
*Say that yes, playing the game has made combat much clearer.*
Desertions...? What do you know about &lt;i&gt;desertions?&lt;/i&gt;
This much is clear: Source runs through your veins. It must be restrained.
*She smiles, her violet eyes fixed on you unblinkingly.*
Locked
Need some chatter t&apos; pass the time, friend?
Seems unlikely, judging by the look of you.
[SCHOLAR] *Ask him for his definition of &apos;smart&apos;.*
I&apos;m afraid I seem to have mislaid my own amulet. Also, you&apos;ll need Lord Arhu&apos;s help in order to get past other aspects of the Path. You have a search on your hands, it seems.
Ifan
Sneaking
Dumora Lam
*Shake your head sadly. You wouldn&apos;t have chosen this.*
*Your touch glides across his hip, around his waist, and slowly moves down with a squeeze as he grins.*
Obedient
You watch yourself. Oddballs don&apos;t last long around here.
You have?! That&apos;s- that&apos;s wonderful of course, but tell me: did you see anything else? Did you find any soul jars?
*State that the Magisters - the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; Magisters - are convinced that the tinkerer Higba is behind the disappearances.*
*Ask if he would sing his rebel song.*
And then there is the one you know as Lohse. She is... something else. Something wicked. You must beware of her above all others.
Master
*Offer to subdue their prisoner - for safe passage off the island.*
Look at that: a fresh face! Lean &apos;n&apos; lovely, like any true elf!
*Clear your throat to get his attention.*
Amadia&apos;s blessing be upon you! How can I help you?
Livestock - Any
How brave you are. How strong. Most could not resist it. But it will not stay down for long. Lohse, you must know -
I need to dig here.
Lightning
Hmm? Oh. Excuse me. I&apos;m very tired. Abominably tired. Beg your pardon.
He has bid me find your kind and return you to your god in the Hall of Echoes.
It is about &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt;, and power is not given. It is taken. With all-seeing eyes and all-consuming teeth.
Removes Burning.
Good, now take it to the Eternal Fire - burn it and free me!
That is what separates you from the Divine Order.
You&apos;re ranging far over that line, too far for me to put up with much longer.
But you&apos;ll never be truly free of the God King as long as he threatens all of Rivellon. There is only one course of action left open to us: I must face the dread king and kill him myself.
was used in violence once more.
Here, Godwoken. Take a bite.
You, on the other hand, would be better placed finding a life boat. I daresay you would be hopelessly lost in the ocean&apos;s dark heart.
Voidwoken! To arms!
Let me have a word with the gentleman, would you? I&apos;ve a little clue to follow up on.
*The creepers knit silently together to weave a pair of gauntlets. Daeyena tears them free, something close to worship in her eyes.*
At the moment of truth... Dallis and Vredeman appeared.
I swore an oath to Lucian. I witnessed the lengths he went to in order to ensure his remains went undisturbed.
Help? Why just walking in the door was help enough. We&apos;ve not had a whiff of Source in centuries, but you? You &lt;i&gt;reek &lt;/i&gt;of it.
Indeed, I may be the only Eternal. My people seem rather... absent.
Save the Ancestor Tree.
Arrow
I did see my husband in the garden earlier this week, cozying up to Lord Arhu&apos;s cat. Perhaps Arhu asked him to look after the beast during his absence.
Examine the beggar&apos;s dog.
*The eyes of the Dreamer are heavy with sorrow.*
Poisoned Rivellon Fries
Goblin Die
*He flips the coin high in the air. It twinkles beneath the moonlight as it spins down and he claps it to his forearm. It&apos;s tails.*
Ah, of course. But I&apos;m afraid that doesn&apos;t matter anymore...
Barrel Open
As for the Godwoken... I can&apos;t let you take them, Roost. You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; me. You know you can trust me. So, believe me when I say this is bigger than any contract.
Caramel
Never met a real hero before. Come on through, but... mind the smell.
You&apos;re cold. Build yourself a fire and warm yourself up. I can get myself back to the Fort fine. After all these expeditions, I know the way well enough.
&lt;i&gt;Adramahlihk!&lt;/i&gt; Thousand-named nemesis! Lord of Soot, come shake black hands with me! Leave her, leave her, come play with &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;e&apos;s inside. Behave yourself. If he don&apos;t like the looks &apos;a ya, he&apos;s likely t&apos; rearrange yer face.
*Smirk and insist there is no catch.*
*Yawn.* Here we go...
The selfsame tiger, I suspect, that has been haunting Lohse.
Magical Wolf&apos;s Head Axe
We ventured deep into the caverns of the Blackpits.
No... it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;true, can&apos;t be true...
*Say that he owes you his life. All you ask for in return is information.*
*Take your leave.*
Maybe you oughta give those companions of yours another chance. Some of us haven&apos;t got anyone at all anymore.
Mad...
I have heard of this woman. No Magister would know. She can deceive our enemies, but sadly she cannot escape them. You do not share this weakness, as your presence here attests.
Saheila. She is my daughter. She is my one.
Oh yes. Yes indeed. You remember when it was last used?
Decrepit Altar
It is no more loss for you than it is gain for me. My task is complete.
*Gratiana reaches out, laying her hand on the wand. You see tendrils of Source start to snake down her arm and into the wand, slowly filling it with new power.*
Isbeil?!
*The horse-sized hound, all hair and teeth and aggression, chews agreeably on his food.*
Skeletons
*Though your eyes are closed, your ears still bear witness to the horrors inflicted upon the young Magister.*
*Ask to hear more about the Endless Prayer.*
Of course, of course. My fragments are your fragments.
[RED PRINCE] *Wish for your empire and throne; your pride restored.*
*Say you&apos;d rather talk to him yourself.*
A servant. A loyal servant...
The Mother Tree asked Sebille to take root and become the new Mother. Sebille agreed. For elvendom&apos;s sake, she will strive for Divinity.
Spirit of a Squashed Traveller
A one-time thing?&lt;br&gt;
*Tell him that the Red Prince sent you himself. You are his envoy.*
*The skeleton wrings his hands, looking around him.*
Hah! This is great. Really. Well, it&apos;s a damn good story.
*Brush through the leaves to touch the statue&apos;s hem.*
Divinity &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be ours.
Lohar didn&apos;t tell me to let any pretty lady in. So why should I?
[LIZARD] *Scoff. You&apos;re only being accused because you&apos;re a lizard.*
What are you doing here traitor? Does your scheming never end?
Ah, there you are!&lt;br&gt;
*You&apos;re curious - what exactly is he looking for?*
Nng!
&apos;A dream is not the answer. Answer search continues...&apos;
We managed to open the door to the inner vault.
*Wonder to yourself if she can read your mind. Imagine dancing with her, drunk in the moonlight.*
*It&apos;s... Malady! &apos;Where the hell &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;you?!&apos; she calls. &apos;Ugh! Find my beacon. We need to get out of here &lt;i&gt;now!&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*The dwarf unfolds her arms and shoots to her feet.*
*The child&apos;s eyes grow wide.*
I didn&apos;t say I liked you. I said you&apos;re my favourite. The cherry pit at the top of the rubbish heap, if you will.
*Observe that she seems very keen to get her hands on these jars...*
*Be on your way.*
Here, where the Mother Tree is rooted, I may hunt my old Master.
This woman is a Dreamer. I can see the answers spinning in her eyes. Do rest your legs for a bit while I question her.
Divine Necklace
Fuligin black and so dense you can feel it tugging at the tendrils of all life and energy surrounding it.
*Say you really don&apos;t have time for this.*
Spirit of a Remorseless Sinner
