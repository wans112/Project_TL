I reached the Arena of the One, where the Godwoken will fight for the right to approach the Wellspring and claim Divinity.
Have you... have you heard of &lt;i&gt;Shriekers?&lt;/i&gt;
So your god seemed uncharacteristically frightened, told you the Void was coming and that only &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;could ascend to Divinity, after which you felt a cold, deep within you.
*Get a good look at his face.*
Spirit of Brother Kaylan
Even an assassin like myself recoils from a Divine rejoicing in slaughter.
*The royal guard&apos;s eyes widen as you approach, Beast in tow. His calloused fingers reach towards the wolf insignia adorning his uniform.*
*Tell him you&apos;d return to the kingdom - and take the throne for yourself.*
Oh goodness, but... I mean... excuse me. I must attend to... er... goodbye!
What else can I do you for? A potion? A scroll? Another dose of my ineffable charm?
You have been kicked from the game
As you wish. I haven&apos;t forgotten your promise, however. And neither has &lt;i&gt;he.&lt;/i&gt;
Ah sure. Just a nasty bruise, by the feel of it. May have to lay off blastin&apos; beasties for a day or two hereafter. The fighter&apos;s lament!
I&apos;m talkin&apos; about the &lt;i&gt;crate&lt;/i&gt;, dwarf. The missing supplies. You heard about it.
Risk? It would be worth any risk to have my answers.
Arhu and the Seekers have Lucian imprisoned beneath the tomb. They tap into his Source and use it for themselves. I know how to access his cell. I can show you the way once we pass the Path of Blood.
*Invisible flames pour over your body, hungry for kindling. It doesn&apos;t hurt - yet.*
All the better. Power is best wielded by those who have no desire for it. You will do well. I&apos;m certain of it.
Whaddya want now?
[OUTLAW] *Ask what this information is worth to him.*
Arrowhead
The Lone Wolves&apos; leader is a savage man named Roost Anlon. I want a piece of him. His flesh. If I can taste this, I will understand why he does the evil he does.
Constitution
I guess so. You&apos;re free to go. But just so you know: I&apos;m watching you.
Look, over here! It isn&apos;t far!
Cursed poison grenade
Yes, yes. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s all very important and whatnot.
You! Hold it right there!
*The oblong object is crystal-clear and unmarked by marks or chips, much like the blade you recovered on Bloodmoon Island. They are clearly two parts of the same whole.*
Reward Chest
*Beast blinks twice as you slowly come into focus.*
Physical Resistance
Hey! Hey you! Lemme see what you&apos;ve got under there. Go on, go on, show me your -
Corrupt things have long stalked the fringes of our world - demons. Here, we sought to help those who fell prey to the foul creatures.

The Devourer
I can see death in your eyes, girlie. You&apos;ll excuse me if I put up a fight!

*In the darkness of the woods you spot a man overlooking a cage that holds creatures crept from a nightmare.*
*Claws shred and fangs gnash; souls, some innocent, some not, are destroyed. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;demon is dead, but a thousand others silence millions.*
Do be careful, my love. Our offspring is yet very fragile.
Maybe Isbeil was on to something. If we release the Deathfog, we take care of the Order...
* Take your leave. *
*Tell her you&apos;re not a girl. You&apos;re a woman.*
*She takes you into her arms, into her heart, into her very being, and it feels like... home. Like you&apos;re back in the Empire, sunning yourself under the jacaranda trees...*
Very well. You have one chance, Godwoken. &lt;i&gt;One&lt;/i&gt;.
*The Magister startles, realising there&apos;s a stranger in his midst.*
*The cult of the Outlaw Empress marked their proving trials with such symbols. She worshipped a dragon, seeking to overthrow the ancient imperial throne.*
We&apos;ve already broken two of those old skulls, perishing the souls within. The maze must not expect us to explore all of its rooms.
If somewhat unreal.
I can&apos;t. I- I can&apos;t. Not now. It&apos;s too late. It&apos;s all too late...
*You move so fast she has no time to respond. Before her eyes even blink once, her lifeless body slumps to the ground.*
...was law.
&lt;i&gt;Help? &lt;/i&gt;Oh it&apos;s much too late for that. I wanted to help - I wanted to restore Anathema, so you could use it against Braccus Rex when the time came. But you wouldn&apos;t do as I asked, and now I have nothing to offer you.
Giant Bone Crawler
*Stingtail is here too, but when he addresses you, another voice lurks behind the Dreamer&apos;s.*
Kids rampaging in the pool, splashing about doing Lucian-knows-what underwater and scaring all the flies away! Lethal plants!
*Mutter your apologies for her loss... of herself.*
Dark magic protects that door. If you&apos;re smart, you&apos;ll leave. You&apos;ll run. Otherwise...
I&apos;m on break now, Yvette... you better &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;fall asleep on your watch again!

Red thinks he can shout &apos;jump&apos; and we&apos;ll snap back with &apos;how high&apos;? I&apos;ll not abase Lohar before one of &lt;i&gt;them &lt;/i&gt;any time soon.
Less talky-talky, more walky-walky...

*They stare at you in disbelief. Then they start laughing.*
*Tell him you&apos;ll do anything you can to look after him, then ask where you should start.*
*Step into her memories.*
Lizard Closet
You are the Dreamer&apos;s dream, Red Prince. And so is &lt;i&gt;she. &lt;/i&gt;We must know what these visions mean, and we must make them come to pass!
*You&apos;re low on patience. Attack your accuser.*
Well! Whyn&apos;t you give it a yank, then?
Comrades...? You shame your kin, siding with those dogs!
You must be in high spirits, my prince, knowing Sadha was delivered from evil! Your victories honour us all.
You have many dangers to brave, and they can help you do so, but never forget what they truly are: rivals!
*Tell her this is a time of great losses. No-one escapes untouched.*
The Queen of Pearls, revered among dwarves.
You just couldn&apos;t do the smart thing, could you?
*Grip the sword by the handle.*
Pants of Beneficence
You get me gone, I&apos;m gone for good. You understand that, don&apos;t you?
It&apos;s not safe here. We should arm ourselves.
And the more villages he drained, the less our power. You can&apos;t raise so much as an eyebrow without Source, never mind a corpse.
[RED PRINCE] *Nod and say relationships are like a game of chess - which of course you always win.*
These poor unfortunates. The Doctor draws his power from them. We must set their souls free. Extinguish the candles.
NO!!!
Hannag&apos;s Flame Rune Of Power
*About Isbeil...*
Bye-bye, lady.
*He gives you a long and steady look, as if challenging you to match his... sensuality.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell her to look you over: you&apos;re a battle-hardened veteran, not an Alexandar-doting, robe-wearing Milksop of a Magister.*
We sail, lad, Duna willing.
*Confirm you were the one that saved Gareth.*
It will if you swing it at &lt;i&gt;me. &lt;/i&gt;Especially if you&apos;re an elven raider with more enthusiasm than skill.

[3] ice shards rain from the sky, each dealing [1] to characters within [4] range from impact.
Are you ready to die for your crimes?
Owlmistress Aoife:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bring you the regular report from the Ancient Empire, though I fear this may be the last for some time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Things are too restless here, and those in charge are agitating against all communication with outsiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fear that all we have worked towards, in terms of free and honest communication, may be about to end. And I fear there is little the likes of us can do about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suffice it to say that the situation here is rather dire, though not as dire as I expect it be when word of the consulate burning reaches Empire ears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your friend, no matter what happens,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mahdi
This place stinks.
It&apos;s my own parents I bury. The cruel irony of fate - that I might show mercy in a world unable to return it in kind.
Oh, you got business with the boss? Makes sense, you two bein&apos; cut from the same cloth, as it were. Go on down, and tell &apos;im Papa Thrash sends his regards!
Do these three really need to be killed? They could still serve the Order well...
Ack ack ack acka... jusssst like lassst time. Sssshe runsssss to her little ickle fading ssshadowssssss. Won&apos;t ssave &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, can&apos;t ssssave you.
Elodi
[FANE] *Promise her you know how it feels to be punished for sins you&apos;ve long atoned for, but if she wants to be saved, she &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;trust you.*
Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.
We escaped the sinking Merryweather and washed up on the island of Reaper&apos;s Eye. Fort Joy looms.
*He grabs the bars of his cage, hard. His hands tremble, even as he tightens his grip.*
Who are you to her? Mother? Daughter? Sister? Lover? If you&apos;re looking for revenge, you won&apos;t find it here.

Sorry, Dad.
Corrosive Touch Skillbook
Malady sent us to Driftwood in search of Meistr Siva of the Seekers. The Meistr can tell us how to proceed.
Not like this... there&apos;s too many of them...
*Standing far back from Ifan, the tight-faced Magister draws one finger across his throat in an elaborate fashion, but says nothing.*
*Growl!* Follow the rules! Or! Else!
*Tell the cat Dallis isn&apos;t aboard the ship.*
*Let him go back to sleep.*
Question him. Someone has been hunting your kind, and Alexandar fancies himself the only Godwoken worthy of ascending.
Someone here likes cats.
There. The ghastly task is done. We need... we need to leave.&lt;i&gt; Quickly.&lt;/i&gt;
If others have not already claimed the chest, then douse the flames, good prince, and sing these words. It will be yours.
*Tell her you&apos;re a friend. She need not fear you.*
*He continues to grope toward you, his sword clenched tightly in his hand. He opens his eyes a fraction of an inch and winces, stumbling over a rock stuck in the mud.*
Serve Jahan.
*Smile - you&apos;re enjoying it too.*
Extinguish the flames.
...and then I made my move. Dragged off that pig when no-one was lookin&apos; and stuffed it in a floor cupboard. Then I crawled onto the platter and pulled the lid up over me. Wasn&apos;t too long before the steward showed up and wheeled me into the banquet, none the wiser.
Creatures like us, yet not. Still smelling of... decay.
Oh, you have exotic tastes, I see. Luckily Trxyl is just the sort you&apos;re looking for. She&apos;s a constant surprise, that one.
*Ask her if she likes what she sees.*
&apos;ey! Prudey! &apos;nother!
We must hurry now! We must race toward the Well of Ascension with all the determination of the eagle diving for its prey.
&apos;Here lies Partman &quot;Winchy&quot; Pruitt.&lt;br&gt;Too generous by half.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Horseman Pass By.&quot;&apos;
Abomination - Any
*Say you met such a man. He is being held by the camp cook, Griff.*
Dead. Bled dry. Did... did the creature in the cellar do this?
*Once, this was a butcher&apos;s. Or an abattoir. Or a haven for cattle.*
Now, then. My dear Lord Arhu, you should have told me to expect visitors!
Hardly. I have been reading this one for several minutes and I have yet to find a single insight into the mysteries of the universe.
*Push your luck. Ask where the entrance to the basement is.*
Thank you! And you might not be it. But you do look it. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m sorry, I call it as I see it!&lt;/i&gt;
Ho ho! Don&apos;t break a head-vein now! Been that long since you&apos;ve been home, has it? Pity, pity...
You will not get away with this!
The limbs they tear from each other are new volumes in the endless history we record. I say leave them to their brutal squabbles.
*Say you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; he&apos;s quite right.*
