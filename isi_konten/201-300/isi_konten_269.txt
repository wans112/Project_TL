Like Lucian, you will be called to unite the powers of the Seven against the Void. Like Lucian, you will lead our proud people to pre-eminence. But unlike Lucian, your weakness will not lead you to foolish failure.
I pray our fallen brothers and sisters find their peace in the Hall of Echoes.
You always were without the merest hint of a spine...
Mode
Deadly Broadsword
The Shadow Prince told me that I must kill Sadha. I played along. The Sallow Man&apos;s magic mirrors will show me where she is now.
Actions
*Sebille reaches out to the tree. She allows her power to burgeon and grow... and then she directs it all at the heart.*
Glass Container
And when we do, I&apos;ll make sure she answers any question we care to throw at her...
Leg Harness of the Mentor
Stone Ring
[IFAN] *Tell him nails are more your style. You didn&apos;t earn the name &lt;i&gt;&apos;Silver Claw&apos; &lt;/i&gt;for nothing...*
Only thing to do is keep your friends close - so close you&apos;ll be able to whip out a short-blade in time, if they look at you funny.
Fortitude
If you don&apos;t stow your weapons, I have no choice but to take them from you by force.
Vitality
Well, what have we here? The ship&apos;s alive, isn&apos;t she.
[IFAN] *Roll your eyes. You should have seen this coming.*
Bloodmoon Island became particularly fecund,
Still haven&apos;t caught on, have ye, son? We&apos;re trapped. Have been all along.
Then again... if you hadn&apos;t rolled in when you did, I might be whistlin&apos; teedle-dee in a Voidwoken&apos;s belly by now. I owe you one.
AI TURN
*Reassure the ghost that there&apos;ll be a new Divine soon - this won&apos;t ever happen again.*
*Say you probably know enough for now.*
...What do you say, Quercus? We once believed it was good,  but now?
*Say you don&apos;t intend to linger a moment more than necessary, and turn to take your leave...*
I don&apos;t think I wanna live here anymore.
*Lay a hand upon the stone.*
*You&apos;re going to carry on the adventure, of course. You&apos;re pretty good at this...*
Extract
*Say that you killed them all.*
You see with our eyes: you can behold the Source once more. But now you must regain the teeth to &lt;i&gt;take &lt;/i&gt;it.
[VILLAIN] *Squeeze his shoulder. At least she died alone, right? She probably wouldn&apos;t have wanted anyone there. No, a lonely, violent death is the way to go.*
With their power returned, the elves reclaimed their lands from the Deathfog and began to rebuild. Soon they would split as two factions sought power - one to bring back the trees, the other to bring back the Scions.
A-a-and she wrote that whole book to cover her tracks, so nobody&apos;d look for the missing gold anywhere near her. She never even &lt;i&gt;met&lt;/i&gt; Roost, though she paints quite an accurate picture of his, erm, bedroom antics...
There&apos;s a dark aura here. I have a bad feeling about this...
Help! Vandal on the loose!
*Those Paladins look well armed. You&apos;d better stay out of it...*
Infuriatingly, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; need to get Stingtail the drudanae he needs to dream.
One of your party members is engaged in dialogue. You&apos;ll have to wait until they&apos;re finished before you can teleport away.
Stop wasting my time then!
Bring the Red Prince to Sadha.
Frost Explosion
*You think the growl belongs to the Devourer himself.*
Guards! What&apos;s that dwarven prisoner doing in here, roaming free?
&apos;Estimated search time: 358,910,227 years.&apos;
This place is dark as any cave. And for a kin to seek out such shadow?
Must be nice! Emmie was the only one who ever cared about me.
You utter villain!
[SOLDIER] *Maintaining composure, ask what she intended to do with the Deathfog Delivery Device.*
Immortality is only permanent, my dear, until one day it simply ceases to be.
*Say that she did, you&apos;re a happy customer.*
You please me, my child. Where you go, the King follows. What you say, the King hears. You travel the edges of the Void, Godwoken. &lt;b&gt;See her dead, &lt;/b&gt;and your rewards will be many.
your summoner
This is for Pearst, scum!
True might is not what one defeats, but what one withstands.
Almira and Mihaly will head for the Lady Vengeance.
&lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; Come on, glumpuss, let&apos;s have a laugh! &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt;
*The Magister&apos;s companion doesn&apos;t blink, frozen in place at the sight of you.*
Quite odd how we&apos;ve travelled so far in each other&apos;s company, yet we&apos;ve never spoken. I am  Tarquin - consider me at your service for trading and such.
*Whistling a high and reedy note, he summons the other Dreamers. At some invisible signal from Brahmos, they all attack you in perfect unison.*
*The hound lunges forward and clamps down on your hand.*
Precious wares, are they not? Until we meet again, ben-Mezd.
*You kiss. It&apos;s sweet and wonderful. You wish it could last forever.*
You come to find. You come to search. But you won&apos;t find the way. A pity.
*Curiously drawn to him, you accept his invitation and reach for the statue&apos;s hands with yours.*
[UNDEAD] *Say that you, too, know the call. But you&apos;re proof it can be resisted.*
Summons a Newt to help you in combat.
Ho, stranger! Come, come! I know this hellish place seems devoid of welcome.
But I will be with you, dear child. I will guide you; stand by you. I will watch as you drink from the Wellspring, and as its Source surges into you.
P-p-p-please, don&apos;t hurt me!
Okay. You can have it for... &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;much. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
But listen to me going on and on even though you told me you haven&apos;t the time to break bread with us! Forgive me: I shan&apos;t keep you a moment longer. Farewell, good sir!
Oven
*She stops suddenly, goes rigid, then relaxes, smiles broadly, and leans over to whisper in your ear.*
Archery Trader
Another free bowl, perhaps?
Slowdown Arrow
Gareth would know what to do...
Back-alleys and rooftops know well the tread of your boot. You&apos;ve got friends in low places, and enemies to match.
In death, the dwarves give eagles life. An elegant passing for an inelegant people.
&lt;i&gt;We&apos;ve&lt;/i&gt; always had a... narrower focus. And that&apos;s not about to change now.
Having comprehension issues, are we? Understandable. Allow me to be clearer: Get out. &lt;i&gt;Now. &lt;/i&gt;
Tree Stump
So... Once the scarring was over and the pain began to fade, the training began. With words, whistles - snaps of the fingers even - the Master could make me obey his every command.
There&apos;s nothing here for you, sister. You should go back out front, where it&apos;s safe.
*Question her plan. Has history not taught her that there is always a comeuppance for such vile crimes?*
Speak the spell during your peregrinations and you will see them. Where the dead lie, the dead linger.
Savegame failed (copy to levelcache failed). Please report this.
*Tell her you miss your people, too.*
Fara... she ain&apos;t coming back.
It&apos;s a good thing I&apos;m in a generous mood. Fine, then. But next time, I won&apos;t be so forgiving.
When I saw calamity ahead, I spoke out. But the truth invites danger. Some would sooner be swallowed by the Void than to tell it - or to hear it. But...
[IFAN] *Say that you&apos;re a Lone Wolf looking for one of your own. Is Ryker home?*
[ELF] *Warn the Magisters - if she is a Scion, you&apos;re bound to protect her.*
The Seekers are too trusting by half; we can&apos;t just let this &apos;healer&apos; go free...
*Mockingly wave your fingers through her ghostly body.*
*Moo.*
Kemm keeps his chamber locked. Beryl Griff believes he keeps secrets from his wife.
Shoulda paid... shoulda paid... shoulda paid...
*Say you&apos;re racking your brain, but you just can&apos;t seem to place him.*
*Say that you haven&apos;t told the Magisters yet.*
*Say you&apos;re looking for a hunter who dabbles in the arcane arts - a Wayfarer.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_4_5dac5eea-faeb-459c-b675-46c51519b784] gold)
Vampiric Vitality
*To the victor, divinity. Tell him it just wasn&apos;t meant to be for either of you.*
Forest - Dungeon Entrance
Ifan ben-Mezd, coming through.
Please, help us! Lift this curse!
The result of a spirit forged to a sword, this soulforged blade fair hums with Source.
It&apos;s just... this is it. This is everything I&apos;ve wanted. Finally, a chance to... to have a &lt;i&gt;chance.&lt;/i&gt;
Use slot
*Tell her she&apos;ll do it because it&apos;s hard to mix herbs with broken wrists.*
Not memories, no. This is the war that looms in the Empire&apos;s future, dear prince. A war against those who scorn our way of life. A war for which we will need &lt;i&gt;strong leadership.&lt;/i&gt;
We found the queen. We need to stop her before she destroys Arx.
Pitchfork Time!
The spirit of the One resides in a single, noble soul. The rest cower in fear.
*Your own hands are shaking. Keep babbling.*
A Letter from Isbeil&apos;s Laboratory
[1] Magic Armour reduction
What.
You a jailor then, darling? Here to keep an eye-socket on these old bones?
Better tread softly - somebody&apos;s in that cave.
You help us more than you know. We must make arrangements. We find the one who hurts Scions. We destroy him.
The Scion of the Mother Tree ate the Shadow Prince&apos;s heart, then asked Sebille to take root.
*Prepare yourself for further battle. You will be the champion, or no-one will.*
Dallis is of the Divine Order. She is our responsibility. The &lt;i&gt;Paladins &lt;/i&gt;will handle this.
Still, I doubt a loving reconciliation was on the cards. Not after everything I put her through.
Back
*Say you&apos;re pleased to know that dwarves in this area are so fond of Sourcerers.*
Join a friend&apos;s game.
Talk to Thola, the Thorny One.
*Anger flares in her.*
Try your luck somewhere else, duckie.
Poison Cloud
Distinctive Wizard&apos;s Hat Agaric
*You peer at the statue, and you recognise her. You knew her: knew her before you were entombed. How strange that such an old face should face you now.*
You know me, Gill.
Parchment

Lulabelle Honeywine, 1218 AD, Ardakhyn, Ancient Empire
Deplorable surrounding for an agreeable conversation, but go ahead.
*Shrug and reach for your weapon. You&apos;re not in a haggling mood - just a killing one.*
*Tell him he has one more chance to change his tone, or he&apos;s going to regret it.*
&lt;i&gt;What kind of a lizard are you?! &lt;/i&gt;My troubles will never be over as long as my body rots in a grave like some &lt;i&gt;common human!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ll be the judge of that, merc.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; . . . G O D W O K E N .&lt;/i&gt;
For you, I can stop. For you, I can trust.
But sure. You win, okay?
Duna&apos;s Scribe
He&apos;s still the same man he always was. He just needs a real friend to remind him of it.
The first step on my mission to kill Alexandar is to contact a Magister Borris in the ghetto of Fort Joy. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be delightful.
This herbal brew tastes delicate and light. A hearty gulp of it can sharpen the finesse of the drinker.
Slug&apos;s Axe
*You feel Rhalic lurch forward in fury, straining against your will. Release it, let it speak.*
*...he was in yours, with all his agonising caterwauling lunacy. He knows you want the secrets of the Council of Seven. He lets you know he has them - and that you will never take them from him.*
*She grabs you by the back of the neck to pull you in for a kiss, and as she does so, her other hand slides down in between your legs.*
There&apos;s a grave before this statue. Maybe he lies buried here. Can&apos;t eat memory from bones though.
Creepy Eye
[CHAMPION] *Tell him you&apos;ve fought for the right to stand judgement on others. You fought and won.*
*When you finally pull away you can tell he&apos;s somewhat embarrassed, but he smiles at you warmly nonetheless.*
Scale-tail.
