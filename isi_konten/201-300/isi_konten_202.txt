You don&apos;t get it. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m dangerous&lt;/i&gt;. You have to pay attention. You have to be willing to hurt me if I&apos;m hurting you or someone else.
Enable shadows cast by the sun. Disabling vastly improves performance on low end GPUs.
Gods, schmods. They aren&apos;t interested in me, and I&apos;m not interested in them. It seems whatever&apos;s inside me is more powerful than any of them, anyway. Or at least more cunning...
A yellow-gutted cur that&apos;s more interested in hiding in his bloody basement than he is getting out and doing what he&apos;s told!
Vulnerable as it was to the machinations of the demons who infiltrated the Houses, it took all the skills of the leaders of lizards to keep the Empire alive.
Keep your distance from the Consulate - the fire mightn&apos;t be the only danger in there...
The Mother is dead and we are free of her terrible plan.
*She leans back, looks you over, and smirks.*
*Your Source reaches out, wrapping itself around the spirit. Its eyes are panicked - it screams and thrashes as it fades into oblivion.*
*He looks at you as the pain builds, and in his eyes you can see him question the point of it all - *
*Hold up a finger. Gold first.*
Vredeman. A venomous cobra, if you ask me. He vomits out silver-plated lies about duty and honour, and the other Reds lap them up like cats slurping milk.
Please, honour her memory.
*Saheila embraces you with a palpable sense of relief.*
*You drag your hand back before the very last of your vigour slips away and you stand, hunched over and gasping for breath. The gentle glow within Vrogir grows brighter until you struggle to look at him.*
Fine sediments swirl from the Autumn Realm of Lapiterra directly into this dense, enchanted orb.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Lohse - the prey that my master seeks... Godwoken...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, you have asked the wizard if he would please join your party as a wizard? And here I was worried that your people might not be the sharpest tools in the crate...
All across the realm she was worshiped and adored.
*The totem looms over you. Its lifeless eyes seem to follow you around...*
I need to ask you something. Tell me true now, for I&apos;m a grown fella with a rind like a coconut&apos;s and a salty old heart:
[HUMAN] *Say you&apos;re just another human, a long way from home. You mean her no harm.*
But even one such as yourself can be redeemed. Destroy the demon, and you free me to the Hall of Echoes. Destroy it, and my roots taint this isle no longer.
...and whoever turned this stretch of cow country into a death-filled valley is likely to be powerful enough to help you, is that what you thought?
Well well, this is a fine sight. Utterly barbaric, of course. Destroying a tree and turning it into a boat? Grotesque. But - well, look at it, Quercus!&lt;br&gt;
Bleed Fire Skillbook
What could have done this to her?
Now, I love Butter. With all my heart. With all my soul. But I love living with all my &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
Thankee kindly. Any chance of another one? Penny for a dead dog, et cetera?
Rainman
Don&apos;t know what that really means come to think of it.

I&apos;m a servant to Magister Reimond. He bade me take the coins to purchase supplies for his journey, but I dropped it along the way. He&apos;s sure to think I stole it.

Why bother being &lt;i&gt;right &lt;/i&gt;when you can be a &lt;i&gt;god?!&lt;/i&gt;
The Pioneer&apos;s Heavy Greaves
*Say the journal has been unclear so far.*
I&apos;m merely being honest. It is not my intention to deceive you in any way. I love Sadha, but I love you too.
*The ghost looks around the room with an incredulous shake of his head and fixates on the set of paintings before him.*
You always seem to catch me at a low ebb, unfortunately... my troop was slaughtered by Black Ring - I&apos;m the only survivor. What are you doing here?
Before I was caught, before I was brought here, I saw a vision. The Voidwoken: slain. Divinity: restored.
No, no, no... I&apos;m afraid that my reservoir of knowledge remains the deepest.
But &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, you didn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;pass the Path of Blood; I&apos;d see it in your eyes if you were pure enough. *Sigh* I told Lucian I&apos;d safeguard his legacy. I&apos;ve failed him.
I&apos;ll stand to my word Sourcerer - &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. Whatever happens here, I&apos;ll fight at your side.
I don&apos;t know how Siva came to know her, but Malady&apos;s a proper ally. She&apos;s not easy to like, but...
A cult? Hardly! We were a race that existed before the idea of &apos;race&apos; was needed. We were all one.
Spirit of Samadel
*Inform him it sounds like a legend. There&apos;s no &apos;the One&apos;.*
I&apos;m starting to feel like myself again, finally.
*You feel you&apos;ve heard this language before, but where, you cannot remember - and what these intonations mean, you cannot say.*
The witch... the witch... the witch...
Hotbar
*Ask how long she has been here all alone.*
&lt;i&gt;...here we do not die...&lt;/i&gt;
*She pulls her hand away, quickly and violently, as if bitten by a snake.*
*He spits at your feet and turns away.*
*He turns to you in surprise and shoots you a rueful smile.*
Skill Schools
Lohar is in Driftwood. He&apos;ll know the truth about Justinia&apos;s plans.
What the hell do I do with&lt;i&gt; that?&lt;/i&gt;
*A disaster? Who did she think you could have been?*
Hah. I&apos;d die a thousand deaths before I&apos;d see this go unpunished.
Moo! Moo!
&lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you were just leaving.*
A two-leg... you&apos;re not &lt;i&gt;straw &lt;/i&gt;are you?
*Duna smiles slightly.*
Might as well. After all, I&apos;ve dealt with worse than you before.
Dismembered Torso
*Say that Hannag is dead.*
*He pulls you close to him, his hard lean body pressing against you. He leans in to kiss you. It is not a gentle kiss. It&apos;s primal, wild even. Your lips bruise and your tongue tastes the metallic tang of blood.*
Soon, Tir-Cendelius will give us the power to smash the Ring and all our enemies.
*Admit you&apos;re not sure who it could be.*
Dorotya...? Rubbish! She&apos;s being courted by one of the other men stationed here. She&apos;s a sweet girl from what I hear... no, she wouldn&apos;t be involved in this.
Sanders the toy-maker helped engineer the Path of Blood on behalf of Lucian. He&apos;s a genius, but his ways are, let&apos;s say, &lt;i&gt;idiosyncratic.&lt;/i&gt;
...must never forget that all citizens of the realm have an equal stake in its success and ought never to be subjugated to the will of the few, and especially not to that of a tyrant. There is not a monarch alive who has not, by sheer force of nature, been removed from the cares and concerns of his or her citizens. Thus, there is not a monarch alive who deserves his or her position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If what I say is true, you may wonder how it is at all possible to govern, if the act of governing itself corrupts. My answer is very simple: Let the people rule.
The whole... affair with that girl happened decades ago. I&apos;ve led a pious life ever since - am I really to be judged for all time because of this one indiscretion?
I know that the dwarves ransacked a Divine Order ship - the &lt;i&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/i&gt;. That ship was bearing a shipment of Deathfog... now it seems they&apos;ve brought it to the sewers of Arx.
*Say you take the hint. Besides, there are other subjects that merit discussion.*
Runic Hat
My Source collar was removed!
*Tell her you&apos;re here with headquarters, to check on the supply.*
I will not feed you answers like a child. If you seek to don Duna&apos;s blessing, you must prove yourself at every stage.
Spear of Foes
*Say you&apos;ll do your best and bid her goodbye for now.*
I know how to make it better. I can fix it. All of it. I&apos;ll tell you.
Clobberin&apos; Time
*You spot a strange lizard gazing over the water with a steady, malcontent stare. His skin is of a bright, blood-red colour. Never before have you seen a lizard such as this.*
Scholar
It&apos;s a sop to all the fools who think that someone will grant them power and immortality in return for loyalty. This God King has cause to make war with the Seven, and the Covenant is how he&apos;s gathered his army.

JUST KIDDING! Hehehe.
Micheil Ros gave us our reward.
*Agree to find this heirloom he wants.*
The world as we know it will soon come to an end, and welcome an undead wasteland in its stead.
But if this is how you feel, then you are still no concern of mine, Godwoken though you may be.
*Tap Red Prince on the shoulder. How about he does the introductions?*
But the sun. O the sun! I had risen as if from the grave and she kissed me back to life.
*Wonder what the Magisters were doing here.*
Then began the process of rebuildin&apos;. Restorin&apos; trust. Handin&apos; out hope. Servin&apos; his people.
Very good. Now, if there&apos;s nothing else...
A paltry consolation at best. I supported your bid for divinity, but it came to naught.
*Ask what he did to cross his fellow Magisters.*
Travels, you say! And why would you assume I&apos;m a travelling man?
Perhaps next time, battle will turn in your favour. Perhaps.
Kin... Child of desert suns... Find me...
The Seven banished the Eternals to the Void and became gods. Aetera made a god-killing device, but it was stolen before she could use it.
Have you lost all appreciation for sound along with your ears? I will not speak &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;name.
And you felt you could throw me a bone.
*She lets it happen; falls back into your arms utterly exhausted.*
*Laugh and tell the little rodent that he should leave it up to you - he&apos;s not going to save the world single-pawed.*
Magister Cryomancer
It wasn&apos;t too long ago that I spoke to him... he mentioned that he was summoned to meet Lord Kemm at his home - official business regarding the tomb, I suppose. Whether the meeting took place, I cannot say...
*Very well, she&apos;s convinced you. Tell her she will be the one.*
It&apos;s stuck fast, it won&apos;t move.
Have you seen these contraptions? This must be the &apos;Magister freak&apos; the blacksmith was referring to. He may have the very tool I need to craft my mask!
The tree, the tree, the tree. The tree&apos;s the girl and the girl&apos;s the tree, and she screams and screams...
Patty Cake, Patty Cake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Potatoes are the most versatile: cook them, mash them, make fries?
Lord Kemm&apos;s gotten reports that she&apos;s somewhere near. As for exactly where, well - I guess they&apos;re still searching.
*Give them a hard look. Reality will soon dawn on them...*
*She sticks her tongue out at you, then gets back to work.*
*Ifan strides to stand by The Doctor then turns to face you, eyes cool as a winter&apos;s lake.*
There&apos;s an imperial consulate here in Arx. Probably a good place to continue my search.
Uuurrgh...
Yes. We go out. We go away from them. I see it.
*The tallest, strongest elf, whom you take to be the leader, gives you a surprised look, then nods to you.*
But she is strong. She is calm. She sees so much - too much for one so young.
*Her eyes are mocking and angry, but you can see that her scales are starting to flake and fall.*
Magical supplies here!
And you came to help me. It seems his faith in you was well-placed.
What cruelty is this? Amadia, deliver peace!
