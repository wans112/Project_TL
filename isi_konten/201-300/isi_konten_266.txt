[FANE] *Suggest the human lowers the weapon and has some faith - the Gods will be more help than steel here.*
*Lean back and squint, assessing the damage.*
*Ask him what happened to him.*
It&apos;s the &lt;i&gt;portent&lt;/i&gt; of it all. I can feel it. The revelation will be... world-changing. I just know it.
You? Join our crew? HAH!
[1] cannot turn Invisible
I do worry about her. I hope she&apos;s safe. I hope they&apos;re treating her well...
Curse you, Mordus - and curse your blasted machine!
Spirit of the Strength Master
I&apos;m sorry, love. Another time, perhaps.
*Roll your eyes at the devastation around them. Some &apos;Welcome.&apos; Ask what the hell they&apos;re doing.*
*Tell the chronicler you want to know more about him.*&lt;br&gt;
Lord Arhu is missing. Should you hear anything, let us know immediately.
Damn!
[FANE] *Tell her your brain is far, far too cramped already. But thanks.*
You keep saying that. It won&apos;t save you.
You will lose all unsaved progress.&lt;br&gt;Do you want to continue?
So! To the dwarves!
[1] summoned [3] onto the battlefield
*Thank the rat, on the presumption that this will prove helpful.*
Let me know if you see any falling boulders coming my way, though. Or goiters, or something.
The half-demon Malady took pity on the soulless Godwoken silent monks,
*He gives you a blank look. His trigger finger twitches. He looks away.*
You were warned!
She can holler all she likes.
You know who I am, Fane. I am the only one who cares. They will say otherwise - they always do, don&apos;t they? But in the end, they will betray you.
Neither kraken nor shipwreck could kill me. &lt;i&gt;Nothing&lt;/i&gt; will keep me from Stingtail.
You... will?
Elements
*Nod. That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what you&apos;re about to do.*
Knight of Amadia&apos;s Gloves
*Ask the shaman for whom the elves are in ritual.*
Then today&apos;s my lucky day. Killing you will make me a rich man, Godwoken. Very rich indeed.
We have arrived at a hideout in the Hollow Marshes. The lizard guarding its entrance, Bahara, has welcomed us inside.
Tsss, tsss. Shouldn&apos;t have come here you silly little sod.
Apportation Scroll
No, wait, I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;sorry! I was lying! Haha! Because I can lie now!
What would you do?
*Grin. So much for the &apos;Eternals&apos;.*
*...and there is only pleasure. All that was, is, and will be fades to fog. What remains are two figures entwined as one.*
*Ask if he realises that was a rather insensitive thing to say.*
Follow Brahmos the Wanderer.
Reaper&apos;s Coast prospered.
*Say you&apos;re not in the habit of telling pretty girls no, and gulp down the second drink.*
*Shake your head. You don&apos;t like secrets.*
*Ask her what it feels like, finally being free of him.*
Crummy Tunic
City Markswoman
*Stifle a giggle. She&apos;s a little paranoid, yes?*
Please... mercy...
[FANE] *Chuckle to yourself, reminded yet again of Duna&apos;s terrible taste.*
She was an interesting creature, I must admit. I didn&apos;t feel that time spent talking with her was &lt;i&gt;entirely &lt;/i&gt;wasted. A pity, to have lost her.
I don&apos;t question the Bishop. He and Dallis would do anything to protect us. And they say he&apos;s Godwoken. They say he&apos;ll ascend.
It is profane.
Elemental Absorption
You head on in now. William&apos;ll get you sorted fast.
So make no mistake, Beast: chances are the road to divinity will be paved with dead gods, their blood on your eager hands.

*Say that you found the little girl she mentioned previously - she&apos;s alive and well.*
Embodiment of Amadia
&lt;i&gt;I said I need to speak to Lohse&lt;/i&gt;. What part of that didn&apos;t you understand?
Bearded Axe
Hand it over; that&apos;s my property.
Ooze surfaces not only poison whoever steps into them but are also highly flammable. Tread with care.
*The brown teeth crumble beneath your fist, dropping to the earthen floor at your feet.*
Hold it there! You are seen using Source! Looks like you cool off in prison.
What strange witchery is this?
*He snorts derisively.*
FreeCamera Rotate Controller Up
*Moo?!*
*Say that the Black Ring will see that he joins his friend before long, if he doesn&apos;t get moving.*
*Tell him that you found evidence of Deathfog in the cave.*
Because you have the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Pet Pal Talent&lt;/font&gt;, you can easily converse with animals.
You thought it was over? How unfortunate for you. You see...
We&apos;ve become... very good friends, haven&apos;t we? Yes. Very good friends.
*Sigh. He&apos;s already dead. What possible danger does he think he&apos;s in?*
[OUTLAW] *Say you know very well what that smile means. She&apos;s staging a heist.*
*Say you haven&apos;t met anyone by that name.*
Wizard&apos;s Hat Agaric Seedling
Well, let&apos;s get you there then! As for me...
Combat Group Alignment for Players
*A Scion? Ask what she means.*
Thank the goddess Amadia, not I.
Ornate Vase
*His eyes snap open as his countenance breaks into an expression of joy. One great paw claps you on the back; the other catches you before you lose your footing.*
Excuse me! What the devil do you think you&apos;re doing?
Almost everyone dies. For a short time, these people lived. Few can say that - including these people, who can no longer say anything at all.
Restore [1] for [4] turn(s).[2][3]
*She laughs and looks around as though taking in the scenery, though her eyes are still covered.*
Wave-dreamer
No creature is born without a history. Without some skeleton in their past.
Split
*If the spirit still had a complexion, he would no doubt turn pale at this point.*
My name is Fane, I am scholar from-... well, I am a seeker of knowledge. That is enough.
Very well then.
Turtle
*You fear what may come next, but still you refuse him: you kneel before no-one.*
A pleasure doing business.
Someone&apos;s making trouble. Move!
Air Resistance Potion
*You kiss Sebille and it&apos;s as if you grow larger; as if your soul expands with life beyond life.*
*Well that was easy, thank her and go on your way.*
Hilarious story! You&apos;re laughing all the way to your grave.
Raft
*Open your arms and brace your bones for the incoming hug.*
Whatever this blessing&apos;s source, it is a welcome gift if it benefits us all. Or at least, if it benefits &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
Imagine - imagine a world in which peace were the only option. Our fleeting lives could be - would be - so very different.
I fear we are no longer united. I fear- well...
I just... I just can&apos;t thank you enough. I could never have defeated the Master without you. I owe you... everything.
*Ask him who &apos;they&apos; are.*
Withermoore&apos;s Cache
I like you. I do! I like you!
HAHA! See! It totally worked! I can lie again!
*Say you did what you thought was right - nothing more or less.*
&lt;i&gt;Ninety-nine bottles of mead on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of mead...&lt;/i&gt;
Kill the coward and be done with it!
*Don&apos;t give him the ring. Shrug and walk away.*

They always do.
*Agree. Godsdamned Sourcerers indeed. Then kill him.*
*The flames around you flare and you&apos;re enveloped in an inferno. The fire rips through you, scorching your flesh and burning your clothes.*
*You smell trouble here. Tell her you need to get going.*
My House of Shadows nemesis summoned me to the Temple of Zorl-Stissa on the Nameless Isle to talk about the Red Princess.
Glad to hear you say it! The day will come we&apos;ll overthrow &apos;em, you mark my words! Until then, I&apos;ll practice the art o&apos; gutting on spoiled fish.
Ah! Music to my beleaguered stomach!
Gods, voids, a perilous journey through the Hall of Echoes... One wonders whether one is awake or dreaming.
Source Point
TEST
Thank you. Come again. Ha!
We do risk more Magister lives by searching... Wery well, we&apos;ll call it off, let the Voidwoken choke on his bones.
*Garvan tastes the stew, then begins spooning it into his mouth. He sighs with pleasure.*
*Leave him be and take your leave.*
Change Image
*He falls asleep. To your surprise the Red Prince lies down and follows suit. After about a half an hour they wake up, and begin to discuss what they saw in their dreams.*
Callous fiend! I shall teach you the etiquette of execution!
Prepare to die, murderer!
*A crooked sneer surfaces from the spirit&apos;s deep pit of contempt.*
Looks like I&apos;m the one who ended up being the target. Did Kemm order the killing - or did he just confiscate this from someone else?
Potions: Poisoned
Not that, ya know, I mind lookin&apos; at the top of that head o&apos;yours.
*Saheila pats Sebille&apos;s right arm with a warm, motherly smile, but then...*
Do you look at me and think &apos;why yes, there is someone with organs enough to drown&apos;? Trifling matters like water and poison do not concern me.
*You have no further use for the altar.*
*You don&apos;t hear, but &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;a whisper in the cavity that functions as your ear. It tells you to slip the ring onto your finger...*
It was a device designed to deliver massive quantities of Deathfog.
Find the soulless child.
*Sebille slowly draws her needle.*
*She mentioned a &apos;vault&apos; before. Ask her where it is, exactly.*
Upstairs, on the second floor. His name is Zharat. Pleasure is his business. Enjoy the experience of a lifetime...
Help us!
*As you approach the young elf, Lohse suddenly grabs your arm. Her hand is damp; her face looks pale and grey.*
*Whisper: Please, Lohse. You can do this. You aren&apos;t done here.*
You offend the goddess and then flee? Is there no more shame in this world?
*Smiles* I believe I shall enjoy this new world very much.
Hah! Collared like a dog! I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
No, but once I have extracted the required material from this specimen, it will all be rather simple.
*Dig deeper.*
Beast&apos;s Blood Vial
*Say you don&apos;t feel strongly that your characters are growing.*
*The vision appears - the dreamers escaping out through the garden and into... a pool. A figure accompanies them... an elegant female kin, with the reddest of skin.*
The honour was mine. But there is still much to do. Lucian&apos;s son is lost. It&apos;s even more vital that Meistr Siva guide you to Divinity.
*...and suddenly jerks to a halt. One of her hands moves to her stomach - it comes away, coated in a silvery, spectral blood...*
Hrrmm! I had all but decided this heathen world had forgotten courtly etiquette - perhaps I was too hasty in my judgement...
*Pardon yourself and take your leave.*
Almira and Mihaly settled in an abandoned homestead.
That&apos;s no way to die. Braccus was quite the tyrant...
[RED PRINCE] *Say that you are indeed new and that you&apos;ve yet to find someone who&apos;ll address a Prince with the proper deference.*
*His eyes widen and he whistles low, the movement causing the fake beard to slip sideways on his face.*
*He laughs wryly, baring rows of shark-like teeth.*
*Sigh*
*Tell him you&apos;ll be back when Marg is taken care of.*

Son of Lucian and Divine apparent, Alexandar uses his power to protect and heal throughout land and sea.
