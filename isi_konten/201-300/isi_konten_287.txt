[RED PRINCE] *Point to the escaping Sourcerer. What good is a slave if you&apos;re going to let him escape so easily?*
The old stories say they&apos;re weapons, devised by the mad Source King, Braccus Rex... they&apos;re these tortured, purged wretches... crucified, a-and forced to channel sheer destruction at whoever their master bids...
You know all the tricks in the book, I suppose. Feel free to have my back.
[IFAN] *Show her Borris in his element... arranging the assassination of innocent people.*
*As the flames die, the spirits call out - one, gently; the other, in a furious rage.*
This language change will be applied after reset.
*Shield yourself and duck, hoping to avoid the blow.*
Soon as the Inquisitor gets here, we&apos;ll hang you right over the side of this ship with it.
Warrior AI
freed of the burden of being the Godwoken.
It is a dark day. And it will get darker still.
*Say they&apos;ve given you trouble in the past, and you&apos;re not here looking for trouble.*
I cannot do anything to prevent it. We are bound together.

Peace be, peace be, peace be...
*Say that, were you a lizard, you wonder what House of the Ancient Empire you&apos;d belong to.*
Hey! I feel... okay! Thanks, woman! Think I&apos;ll wander off now. &apos;ere, &apos;fore I go, what can I do to show my gratitude?
*Your whole body flushes. You&apos;re sure you must be glowing, so deep does the warmth dwell.*
Dust Blast Skillbook
You... you wouldn&apos;t, ben-Mezd... no, &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;, there&apos;s no coming back from that!
Elven Mask of the Shapeshifter
I... I can&apos;t. That&apos;s Donna in there. She was a friend. OUR friend.
*Express surprise at his welcome. He&apos;s been expecting you?*
I don&apos;t need this distraction. Why don&apos;t you go stroll in the garden, or something?
Sorry, I- I- almost forget sometimes.
*An ancient memory overwhelms you. You are no longer you - but you still sense Source saturating the air, more than you have ever felt before.*

Something stirs in my memory. Something long buried! I... I don&apos;t...
Perhaps you are right. Perhaps not. Give me time, let me think. Whatever may be, Lucian shall guide me.
Am I? Am I being stupid? Think, Stingtail, think...! &lt;i&gt;The scar!&lt;/i&gt; That is why you seek me...
I thought this place was supposed to be abandoned.
*Your scales tremble and your tongue is numb. Your inner Source pours into him, and his into you...*

GREETINGS LORD AND LADY KEMM - GRACIOUS AND BELOVED
*It&apos;s the name of a goddess, isn&apos;t it?*
Please, don&apos;t flatter yourself. The wound wasn&apos;t that grievous, it just put on a bit of a bloody show for a time.
Well, well. This is more like it! Finally, a structure with tasteâ€¦
Find the Red Princess.
[RED PRINCE] *You recall the power building inside you: the stare that enthralled a demon. Unleash it!*
Dear lord, I might as well try and teach mathematics to a dog chasing its tail...
And by the by, you oughta find Griff in the kitchen. He&apos;s always lookin&apos; for more of &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt;kind to get in on what&apos;s good to get.
*The Godwoken may die here. &lt;i&gt;But a new Divine may rise.*&lt;/i&gt;
We left the Nameless Isle with the conflict between the Mother Tree and the Shadow Prince unresolved.
Civil Abilities
Wait. I must ask you something.
*Your blood is up. Ask him if he wants to... go again.*
Nenny
*Say you washed up on the beach not too long ago. You&apos;re still getting your bearings.*
Two-Handed Slicing Axe
*Ask him where you are - what is this place?*
*Prudence regards you with humility. It gives her strength. She carries no fear.*
There.
Lucian&apos;s righteous light guided Gareth and Siva. They blinded him, caged him, but the damage was done. The Seekers were disbanded, Dallis was empowered, and I, well...
You can fool the eyes of those simple creatures. But we are not simple creatures.
*Agree, and ask what they were doing here.*
*She rises from her bow. The deep blue veins on her face pulse violently.*
I miss you.
Lizard&apos;s Warhammer
*The elven priest fervently prays.*
Considerate
We learned how to consume the Source of spirits and claim it for our own.
*Hesitate. Something seems off...*
Marg the troll is dead. Grog will be happy. Or at least less grumpy.
I could do with a few things for my satchel and a sharper blade - let&apos;s see what goodies the Magisters left behind.
*Under his hood, you can see old, fading tattoos marking his neck. An image of Lucian in profile; the symbol of the Divine Order; cursive script spelling out a prayer to the Seven. In his eyes, no faith remains.*
Emperor of the dead? To sit on a cold, grey throne amid a vast necropolis? Never.

*Apologise, but you don&apos;t have any Source to give.*
Ah. It&apos;s a bargain you seek. So here&apos;s one: I give you the information you want if you do the same for me. A perfectly even deal.
[JESTER] *Tell him he&apos;s ugly too.*
Now, if you don&apos;t mind, another query:
Secret Vault
Undress...
I&apos;ve found a new Master. A kind Master. A promise of eternity.
Next time we should ask how it knows us &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;stomping it to slime.
I think I&apos;ve heard about you. Didn&apos;t you catch the Magister-killer in Driftwood?
Hold it right there! I&apos;ve been authorised to search all of your belongings. Now let&apos;s have a look.
Dungeon - Chasm
Me too. What wuzzz we doing?
Dungeon - Empty Room (Two Squares)
*Agree to keep things peaceful.*
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;will be the Divine of the light.&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;will be the Divine of the darkness. All things in moderation - isn&apos;t that right?
*The dwarf bangs his palm against his head.*
Excuse me. You travel with Lohse, do you not? We need to have a word, you and I.
[BEAST] *Ask her to help you. To help you help your people. To show you exactly what to do.*
*Say you think so.*
Off to hunt? Stock up here.
I feel &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;. Neither the strength of your hand nor the warmth of your touch.
Well, do make the most of your visit. And be sure to stroll through the gardens. I have quite a green thumb, you know. I planted every bulb and scattered every seed myself!
*You feel your God stirring. Ask it to intercede, just once, and spare you from the sacrifice.*
To learn the combination we must gain the favour of all seven gods.
Truly impressive, how you navigated your way through my little test. It&apos;s only a shame that you weren&apos;t willing to have a meeting of minds in private...
If you side with &apos;life&apos;, then you best keep to yourself - as best as a lizard can manage, anyway. The louder you cry and the harder you pray, the closer to death you tread.
I hope you understand them to their full extent. The other gods must either bow to you, or be undone!
I tried one of your potions already, remember? It didn&apos;t help.
No... no, I suppose it wouldn&apos;t... But I remain torn. Hmmm. What to do with it?
You would be, too, if you had a yellow-haired Yarrow child like mine. Sweet thing. Papa&apos;s pride.
*The three fawn-coloured stags shake their antlers; the clouds clear from their eyes.*
They thought that having a single Divine to unite them would aid in the fight against the Void. But look at them now: weak, fragmented, desperate. Even weaker than I expected.
*Say something sounds off about her offer...*
Remorse
I put my faith in the Bishop. Reminds me of his father. And what he&apos;s said has been true: Wherever there are Sourcerers, Voidwoken strike.
So you would end your path to Divinity here and now, then? How... unfortunate for you. No matter. I&apos;ve kept my promise. But there is another bargain I must fulfil...
*Point to the machine. She didn&apos;t notice the leaking defraculator? Or the redundant Source array?!*
*Tell her you&apos;ll do whatever&apos;s necessary.*
Those who demand your service are rarely concerned with your well-being. I know this. I am living proof of this.
You are my champion, after all. I saved you from the darkened seas, where you would have been lost and forgotten forevermore. I need to know how badly I&apos;ve chosen before we proceed.
The captain left with a warning.
*Chuckle along with him. Good stuff, good stuff!*
Team 1
*Place a hand under what&apos;s left of her dress and move it up along her inner thigh.*
Very well. Now keep still. I can&apos;t let you distract me.
Friend of Master&apos;s. Used to smell old. Now he smells rotten. And he&apos;s mean! Threw my ball away!
You met my brother? Really? Hm. Alright. We have a deal. You first.
Lohse returned to her music and enjoyed a storied career as the Divine&apos;s premier musician.
You would barter for your life? Like some pathetic fishmonger?
*She mumbles to herself. Something about &apos;dumb dwarves&apos;.*
*Ryker closes his eyes and spreads his arms, but stops and flashes you an inquisitive look.*
*Scoff and say that nothing&apos;s impossible.*
*She falls into a contemplative silence for a moment, then perks up once again.*
He died to save us all. Yourself included, though you don&apos;t deserve it. And when a new Divine ascends, the Voidwoken will be cast back from whence they came.
Very well then. Let&apos;s see if we can&apos;t snatch Divinity from the jaws of the Void.
*Tell her that her husband has a shrine to the God King - the patron of the Black Ring - in his vault.*
[FANE] *Tell him it&apos;s been an eternity since you&apos;ve tried.*
Come on - and hurry.
*Pay up.*
Vampirism? It is as twisted and cruel as the legends say. But these vampires suck no blood, only Source.
My faithful eagles work still. They know their duty, they need me not.
Thankee kindly. Any chance of another one? Penny for a lost dog and all that?
Proving Ground
What would he have to gain by killing me? Strange forces are at work...
Adramahlihk possessed Lohse, body and soul.
How bad is it? Say on a scale of one to ten.
You&apos;re on thin ice, human. And I&apos;m very close to cracking.
Tschhhh, adults always want to &lt;i&gt;talk&lt;/i&gt;. Can&apos;t I just play here with my shells a while?
Perhaps you can succeed where I can&apos;t. My heart breaks for our ascendant. Find a way to relieve its suffering, and I will find a way to reward you.
*Ask about your reward.*
*Awkward as it is, offer to trade with her... if she&apos;s still interested.*
Undead Warrior
The Hall of Echoes
*Try to wriggle free of his grip.*
Skyfort
*He shrugs. His face is a bland mask, but his voice is heavy, muted.*
I hope Arhu is well. He was kind to me when I first came here as a child. I remember it well.
Applies Burning.
If yow be not with the God King, yow be against. &lt;i&gt;So rejoice, I bring yow death..&lt;/i&gt;
There&apos;s more to this ship than meets the eye... We&apos;re not out of the woods just yet.
A hefty club as dense as the head of its last owner was.
Indeed! It&apos;s not just decomposing flesh and bone dust underfoot, as you know. Why, the very essence of decay flavours many an essential oil and tincture.
*Say you hadn&apos;t expected to meet her here.*
Most wise. Good luck to you.
