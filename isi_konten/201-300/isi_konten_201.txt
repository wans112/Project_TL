*Ask what happened in a quiet, cold voice.*
*He momentarily snaps out of his daze and shoots you an indignant scowl.*
There&apos;s few enough rays of light left in this world. And you&apos;re the brightest.
*Ask what&apos;s the matter.*
Okay darling. Let&apos;s do it.
Copy
*Say you&apos;re not even entirely sure Lohar&apos;s behind all this.*
Yeah, right. But I&apos;m too busy right now to arrest you, so you can move along. *Sips.*
Now I&apos;m just waiting for &apos;em to call my name. Waiting and remembering.
[Memory Persuasion]
Please- please let them return the Soul Jars to me. I pray, sweet mother...
Awesome!
Installing
*State that you&apos;ve heard of him - he&apos;s a historian of some note, is that correct?*
*Hold the cloth tighter to the wound.*
[MYSTIC] *Tell the cub the gods shall provide.*
Find shelter - the undead are among us!

Here, in the Blackpits, are White Magisters. Their operation is shrouded in mystery, and this pricks our ears. We are &lt;i&gt;gravely&lt;/i&gt; concerned. We believe the White Magisters may have strayed into the darkness.
You! Don&apos;t suppose you&apos;ve seen anyone defacing local property, have you?
If he won&apos;t open it for you, your next best bet is to give your message to Sister Avenny. She&apos;s the only one with permission to enter.
Silver Claw, howling wolf, Godwoken... the Void seeks you...
Her wife can drag her away when Kemm says so and not before.
Create Blood Surface
A sinner I, and who is not? The sinner lies; that they sin not. &lt;i&gt;A sinner lies. &lt;/i&gt;And yet the boneyard&apos;s full of sinners who got their prayers while I did not.
*He reaches out and gently squeezes your arm.*
Thanks for nothin&apos;, reptile.
The Collector
Wait - my lamp... where is my lamp? Where is my sanctuary?! You-
Back... back into the shadows...
The Red Prince came home a hero.
*Tell Ifan that&apos;s one acquaintance you&apos;re not eager to make.*
*He takes two more steps towards you.*

*Assure him that Alexandar is dead. You already killed him. &lt;i&gt;Twice.*&lt;/i&gt;

Chapter 5 - The Nameless Isle
They&apos;ll tear the place &lt;i&gt;down!&lt;/i&gt;
You must know I was desperate. The House of Shadows closed in around me, determined to kill me before I could become the mother of dragons.
I&apos;ll live.
Notify the Doctor that his fish is available.

Kill Combat
Deathfog&apos;s still pouring out of the sewers.
To prove you are the &lt;i&gt;One&lt;/i&gt;.
Dwarves led the world... until the truth of the Divine&apos;s deal with the demon emerged.
Steady on, bub! Naught but a couple of coins, this!
I see your collar marks. They had you too, eh? Believe me, I&apos;d have preferred to go straight to the Joy.
For all the fighting, I never once saw Dallis with the Magisters. The snake is probably cowering in some burrow.
*The spirit looks to the ground and begins to chant - softly at first, and then with increasing intensity.*
Urgh, that stinks.
A trap! Better give it a wide berth.
*The spirit cowers and tries to beg for mercy, but it&apos;s too late. He is consumed, his spectral wails lingering in the air even after he is gone.*
*Tell him you tend towards the male.*
Coal Baskets
Descend through the hatch.
Spirit of Mabel
Toyseller Sanders
That was fine work, and brave too. You have my thanks. I presume Thom has paid you.
*Nod. Tell him where the Lady Vengeance is docked.*
Astral Dragon
*Bare your teeth to show how you feel about him, then walk away.*
*Squints...* How do you know about Syrus Oates, sir?
When they learned of the Divine&apos;s deal with the demon, they gathered together,
You hear me, human. Leave.
Sweeper
Yeah. So what? He has loads of paintings.
&lt;i&gt;Some &lt;/i&gt;people are beyond saving, of course.
Voidwoken - Easy
Rotten Severed Head
That elf didn&apos;t have to die; she harmed nobody.
*Wonder why the Magisters had a little boy locked up here in the first place.*
Metal Staff
I showed Jonathan mercy. He is free.
Welcomed me? This world showed me nothing but contempt when I showed it my true face! No, this world did not make me feel welcome.
*She reaches into the folds of her dress and produces... an empty glass vial. She holds the vial up to you and locks her eyes on yours. The vial, you notice, begins to fill with marrow.*
Your power... I have made it mine!
Paladin Keene
Lone Wolf Talent
That&apos;s not yours!
Lock Hotbar
Spirit of Paladin DeSelby
*Say you&apos;re far from home and probably wouldn&apos;t know her mother anyway.*
*Lean in close and whisper that you want to meet the spider downstairs.*
*Touching the wall beneath your fingers, the livewood hums at your touch. You understand that the Lady Vengeance has carved this space &lt;i&gt;for you &lt;/i&gt;in gratitude for your help.*
That&apos;s right, it is.
Scroll
You&apos;ve no business with me.
We found Source weapons in the basement of the Fishworks.
*The spirit looks to you, confused.*
Last Picked Up
Shadow over Driftwood
You know who I am, don&apos;t you? But do you know who you are? You think you&apos;re the Divine-in-waiting, but you&apos;re not. You&apos;re a lie. You&apos;re not real. You are, you see, &lt;i&gt;unfinished business.&lt;/i&gt;
Vengeance V
A word of warning though: he is like a shred of nightmare ripped from the dream realm, set loose in reality. Do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; underestimate this creature.
Go no farther, if you wish to survive. The Doctor will not tolerate your kind here.
You&apos;re free to go, but I&apos;ll be keeping an eye on you. You&apos;re not half as innocent as you act.
*Tell her she doesn&apos;t know you well enough to make so many assumptions about you.*
&lt;i&gt;*Twist.*&lt;/i&gt;
What?! The Doctor&apos;s cake? A gift, from one notable to another. It was a prime piece of cakework too, but it didn&apos;t get cut - the Voidwoken attacked before dessert.
Hey, look - a lamp!
Try to open a lock using a lockpick.
I&apos;m not so keen to welcome a scaleskin, but Reimond must hear your words. You may pass. But tell me, lizard: did you see signs of battle? Of my Magister brothers and sisters?
*It lunges at you, violent fingers grasping only air.*
It seems the human that stole my mask was rather more resourceful than I gave her credit for.
Whatever.
But... but... Lucian spoke of absolution for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;. I... I must...
Still, the Paladins...
Two souls... so different. Two souls bound together by the demon. One... a humble man. A father. The other... a... &lt;i&gt;a killer.&lt;/i&gt;
*The vision shifts. You see burning villages. Slaughtered women and children. You see her, Purging Wand in hand, standing amongst it all. She throws her head back and laughter echoes in your skull.*
Bark! Bark! You smell like *sniff* a wolf! Out of my sight!
Survive the Path of Blood.
*Take a step back and say this isn&apos;t your quarrel.*
*Take your leave.*
Mighty Seven, smile upon your servant, Brother Kaylan.
You got the money?
*You&apos;re done here. Take your leave.*
Blessed Web
*Tell Ifan you&apos;d like to know what he reckons your next move should be.*
I&apos;m not sure. It&apos;s got something to do with the braziers, that&apos;s all I know. I think you gotta just light them all.
Huh. Not for you? Perhaps it&apos;s an acquired taste.
[OUTLAW] *Offer to poison him.*
Thank you. Thank you for your mercy. Now, I&apos;ll get back to work, if you don&apos;t mind. I&apos;ll keep my head down and my nose clean.
Figured you&apos;d ask me about that! Ain&apos;t looking too good for you lizards. Word is the Divine Order&apos;s gonna hit your empire and hit it hard!
Anhar, you saw it with your own eyes! You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; Sourcerers lure Voidwoken. And you &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;we&apos;d all still be alive if you hadn&apos;t attacked our caravan.
*She says nothing. She looks remarkably ordinary, you think, for Black Ring. But then you hear a voice in your own head.*
GRAAAGHHHH!
*Dip your head in acknowledgement as you leave. Don&apos;t expect him to do the same.*
They looked like Lohar&apos;s crew. Something isn&apos;t right here...
*Sebille&apos;s spirit dips her head in your direction and gazes out onto the sparkling sea.*
I&apos;m not a &lt;i&gt;inmate!&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;m a &lt;i&gt;patient!&lt;/i&gt; The Order - they&apos;re taking &lt;i&gt;care&lt;/i&gt; of me, of &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;. They&apos;re the only ones looking after us now the Divine&apos;s gone.
That should stem the tide...
Highly flammable and prone to unsettling rattling noises, the less time this arrowhead spends in your backpack, the better.

He no longer whispers your shame.
So? What&apos;s the news?
Ain&apos;t a bad one. Ain&apos;t bad at all.
Trusting flesh to do bones&apos; work? It seems foolish, but very well; mark the location thus. And do not disappoint us.
C&apos;mon Dot, we&apos;ll go kill rats or summat, take your mind off it. &apos;ere you are, as a token of my gratitude, there&apos;s a shiny wotsit under the bath upstairs might be of interest to you.
Who&apos;s asking?
*Ask to see this treasure trove.*
Essentially it means that our peoples&apos; memories will become my memories. All of them. Yours as well.
*The skeleton ekes out a crackling moan.*
Destroy the Mother Tree.
Holy Book of Matrimony
*Tell him you&apos;re more than ready for a peaceful world.*
The Magisters suspect that Bloodmoon Island is a hive of Sourcery. Perhaps we may find a teacher there.
[UNDEAD] *Inform the apparently confused fellow he doesn&apos;t know you. Your face, perhaps, but not &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Spirit of Delorus
&lt;i&gt;Purity of Mind.&lt;/i&gt;
Damned idiot! You&apos;ve asked for this!
*The spirit shudders and cries, tears running down his cheeks.*
Spitting sparks with each strike, this dagger has the chance to set Burning on those stabbed with it.
You are Victorious
*Cast a skeptical eye over the fish on his work table, and ask what&apos;s in it for you.*
Wait, you fool! Is &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;how you react to having your authority challenged? This will not stand, Godwoken. Your skills are gravely underdeveloped.
*You&apos;re hit by another blast of energy. The power in the columns fades slightly, resetting to a gentle glow.*
*Nod. It&apos;s a risk you&apos;ll have to take.*
*Swann shakes his head with a sigh.*
You want the word? Figure it out for yourself. I&apos;m going back to bed.
The Meaty Stew became famed almost as much for its food as it was for its greasy, abusive owner.
Yow&apos;re still here, yow thralls, when yow&apos;re s&apos;posed to be reportin&apos; to camp. Get yow gone.
*The cook smiles, expertly concealing any offence caused by your comment.*
I ain&apos;t worried &apos;bout one man&apos;s madness. I&apos;m worried &apos;bout the wailin&apos; of the childless mothers he left behind. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m worried &apos;bout the trail of crimson limbs the innocent were forced to clean away.&lt;/i&gt;
I knew it! I tried to convince the Magister in charge, Carver... but he wouldn&apos;t listen...
Her intentions are honourable - and that&apos;s good enough for me. We should assure her safety.
I&apos;m happy to report that the consulate no longer burns. Please, do accept my gratitude if you had a hand in this feat.
I see your mother raised you very well indeed - rare, for a dwarf, but all the more impressive. You and my Kniles might even get along. What brings you to Driftwood, darling?
*Noting the wounded, remark that she has a lot on her plate.*
&lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;didn&apos;t do anything. It was that thing, whatever it is. It&apos;s just a visitor. It has nothing to do with me.
If the God King has truly abandoned her, then this is our chance to slay her once and for all.
&apos;Only the God King Knows the Weight of &lt;i&gt;Responsibility&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Do not linger in this pit of darkness, Lohse! Divinity will be yours!
*The breastplate writhes, tendrils pressed tight into flesh. The Magister&apos;s eyes roll wildly.*
*Let the Dreamer take you back.*
