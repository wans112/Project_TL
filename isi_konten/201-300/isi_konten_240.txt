One of your people? No, Fane. I am an Eternal. I cannot conceive what you have become.
I... guess...
So did I, but the Void creeps and crawls into everything. I told you before. It is stronger than ever. But so are you.
*A yawn, a few mumbled words, and the lizard falls asleep. You sit in the sand, close your eyes, and follow him...*
Say as you will, wife. Madame Josephine Gribbles De Peeb won&apos;t be treated so!
Metal Staff
Never work for dwarves. I should have known there&apos;d be Sourcerers amongst &apos;em. They were asking for Voidwoken.
I don&apos;t wish to minimise your struggles, elf, but do remember I beknight women and men who have overcome obstacles far greater. Isbeil - is there more to tell?
When did it happen?
Dwarf Bandit Elementalist
I give &apos;em that edge.
*Thank her anyway and leave.*
&apos;m I in your way, sir?
WANT. WANT. WANT.
Cut it out. I don&apos;t ask you again.
Equipment
[LOHSE] *Shudder and wonder what the hell you&apos;ve gotten yourself into.*
Boss said to keep the doors open but... but truth be told, I feel ill just standing here. By Duna, closing can&apos;t come fast enough.
I&apos;ve always wanted to see an impish pocket realm.
Painting of Lucian
We&apos;re in the right place. Once the right brick slips into that slot, we&apos;ll be able to find the queen.
Spirit of a Dead Dwarf
Certainly. You may not be a lizard, but your kind are hardly so bad as the &lt;i&gt;humans&lt;/i&gt;.
Please... speak the spell...

*AND IT WANTS&lt;i&gt; YOU.*&lt;/i&gt;

Instantly kill this summon, allowing you to summon another creature instead.
Animators Reference: ST WeaponSet
*Turn away and leave them to their grief.*
Worn-out Magister Shield
Could not learn [1].
*Try to fit Toyseller Sanders&apos; amulet in the slot.*
You listened to &lt;i&gt;Lucian&lt;/i&gt;. You &lt;i&gt;obeyed&lt;/i&gt; Lucian. After everything he did? You allowed him to take our Source. And now you have restored a tyrant to power.
*She pulls her arm out of your hands with a jerk.*
We were not always like this - we were once a proud, upright people! Our princess was betrothed to marry Braccus Rex, the Source King!&lt;br&gt;
*Tok! Sniff! Tok!*
*Say that if you&apos;re to become a Master of the Source, surely there is no better tutor than himself.*
Look about you, sister! Do you feel an all-powerful sun, or see the desert on all horizons? We are far from house and law.
Rotwrg the Accursed
You have returned, but not with the spectre of death. What would you know before you return to your bloody business?
All she needed from you was a dollop of prophecy juice. I dare say she got it.
Not enough [1] to extract this rune
She has learned nothing, but I have:
I wait for the inevitable. Whatever that might be.
Nothing. Let&apos;s keep moving. The sooner I find a way to get this bloody thing out of my head, the better.
Level Templates
*Frown. Did he say that Alexandar is here...?*
He who has no sin gets knifed by he who does. Nothing wrong with a bit of old-fashioned pragmatism.
Oh, and... do bring Lohse along, won&apos;t you?
Phantom Protection Amulet
Well, that was easy! Looks like you&apos;ll have to pay your internment fee after all, freshie...
*Inform him of Hannag&apos;s fate. She no longer lives.*
Looooooook! The one who set us freeeeeeee!
*The dwarf shakes her head vigorously.*
Elven Lance
Deaths
*Ask if he isn&apos;t afraid that Voidwoken will be attracted to his use of Source.*
*She raises a glass and glances at yours on the bar.*
*You scrape your knee on the wooden floor. Nothing else happens.*
But the waiter throws him out, right?
Who else could I be but Rivellon&apos;s finest artisan? My masterpiece was the Devourer&apos;s armour, worn by our beloved Outlaw Empress.
Dead Wedding Guest
It isn&apos;t. Ma&apos;s in our house across the river. The bugs haven&apos;t gotten in yet. I &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;she&apos;s inside!
Oh. Ah...
Boss&apos;ll be fine. He&apos;s got himself in a fit state now, but soon as another shipment comes in, he&apos;ll be right as rain.
*Bat your eyelids and say &apos;no&apos;.*
Lord
my last hope of ever being freed of the God King&apos;s terrible tyranny faded when the Godwoken claimed Divinity.
Camera Forward
Oh, but you seem to be a bit feverish. Violent plants? That&apos;s simply impossible: those seeds were a gift from the Doctor himself. As exotic as these symptoms you&apos;ve presented with, I dare say.
Because along with torture and interrogation, the Magisters found space in their schedules to purge me, that&apos;s why!
I&apos;ll back the Red Prince&apos;s claim on Divinity and stand beside him at the Well of Ascension.
Ignore him, Geraldine. We&apos;re better than that.
*...fear.*
Roll her out, won&apos;t ya? I can hear my lad from here!
Free... free me. Release me from Mordus&apos; torture.
Wha - what&apos;re you doing here? What do you want? You mustn&apos;t linger... you mustn&apos;t remain...
New information was added to your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Journal&lt;/font&gt;. Bring up the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;panel selection radial&lt;/font&gt; to access it.
I don&apos;t doubt that you do. He was fond of blood too.
*She greets you with the same steady black-bloodshot gaze.*
*Say that you&apos;d hoped to face the end together.*
An old friend.
...does not deserve the faintest breath of praise.
Calocera Growth
I don&apos;t know what that statue&apos;s doing, but it doesn&apos;t look good.
You desired power, and so it&apos;s yours. My venom seeps into every pore.
What?
We... shouldn&apos;t talk about this now. I&apos;ll be fine. I just need to concentrate.
The Three Altars
You and one other - for the God King still calls your name.
*Let the undead creature waddle away. He did his part.*
*Fight against the urge to be sick and introduce yourself.*
Well, you may not always have the smarts, but you&apos;ve sure got the spirit!
Complete the set of elven armour.
*You are relieved of the past&apos;s nightmares and the future&apos;s burdens. All that matters is &lt;i&gt;now.*&lt;/i&gt;
Attack_Melee_Std_2
*Explain that you, too, are on the hunt for Sourcerers. Ask the Magister to spare the parents; they could provide you with valuable information.*
Alright. You can go. &lt;i&gt;For now.&lt;/i&gt;
If we&apos;re to escape the island, we need to defeat the Shriekers on the shore.
*Thank her warmly for caring about you.*
The kin remains in this tomb? Xiuh&apos;s master would never have approved.
What now?
You&apos;re dead, Alexandar, you have to stay lying down!
I already fell for one lie. I won&apos;t fall for a second...
In any case, yer in for a treat, lass, better than sweet cream stew on Lucian&apos;s Day! Who&apos;s comin&apos; along with ya? It&apos;s yer only chance, so put yer thinkin&apos; cap on.
Chests
*Blink your eyes hard and yawn. You must have been sleepwalking!*
Unusual Platemail Armour.
In many places... I feel my body in a hundred moving graves... warm and wet...
Nice poem. Kinda wasted on humans though. No offence.
Custom Stat Tooltip
Fine. Deny me. My needle will guide me rightly if you do not.
The dead intruder in Kemm&apos;s hidden vault was part of a network of thieves.
*Call out to the hound and ask it what&apos;s the matter.*
I don&apos;t want Stingtail&apos;s blood on my hands.
*Agree. It&apos;s time to get the party back together.*
*Draw your sword. You see through his honeyed words!*
[BARBARIAN] *Draw  your weapon. You don&apos;t care if the demon came from the helmet or a Magister&apos;s arse - you&apos;ll put an end to it.*
Wooden Wagon
[OUTLAW] *Turn to the elf and frown... isn&apos;t she Elodi &apos;Impaler&apos; Oldwood, the famed assassin of the north?*
GAME CONTINUES!
*Shrug. You are neither proud nor ashamed. You just &lt;i&gt;are.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him if you didn&apos;t believe, you&apos;d have nothing to live for.*
*Give them some space. You&apos;ve the feeling they&apos;ll need it.*
Good choice. Now make another good choice and don&apos;t let me see you around here again.
Back so soon?
Good for a little magic, wouldn&apos;t you say?
*Beast offers only a &apos;harumph&apos; - which the priest chooses not to hear.*
*Tell Gareth to hold on; you are still being &lt;i&gt;watched.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the demon that it&apos;ll be the one who&apos;s screaming when you&apos;re through with it.*
HIS! HEAD! Nothing else will do! NOTHING ELSE!
...it was glorious.
Gleaming and burnished, the armour worn by the knight in this picture looks as if it cost an arm and a leg. And from the flecks of blood marring the gauntlets, perhaps it did.
*He throws you a staff - you catch it instinctively, and from Sallow&apos;s mind you understand that this staff kills the dead. Use it on a corpse - &lt;i&gt;and there is no coming back.*&lt;/i&gt;
Wainslow and I came across it while were looking into some inmates who went missing from the prison.
*The elf beckons you into the back room, a hungry, playful look in her eyes...*
Graceful Two-Handed Axe
I need you. The Seven didn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;abandon&lt;/i&gt; Rivellon. We are trapped here, powerless and squabbling. You - ruthless son of humanity - &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; will be my champion in the world. You are my Godwoken.
*Close your eyes and let the music take you.*
Rhalic should be my god too, but he doesn&apos;t speak to me. Even a desperate god doesn&apos;t see me as his champion...
No deals, no discounts.
Well, when you put it that way...
*Tell her it was necessary. Whatever Justinia is doing... a lot of innocent people would get hurt.*
I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t mean to sound condescending, but I had thought it quite self-evident I was gazing out over the waves.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 17: Metamorphosis
Lamenting Sebille&apos;s failure to root, Saheila pushed her to claim Divinity for the sake of all elvendom.
*The chronicler winces, then tries to hide it by standing up straight.*
Dazed
Just... just... o&apos;en the chest. That&apos;s all. O&apos;en the chest. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;s &apos;egging you...&lt;/i&gt;
*Swear at it under your breath.*
Lava Dark
Go now. Leave me be. My mind has very important places to be. *Ahem* You&apos;ll see.
I am me. I am whole. I am Xhaxh!
Dallis - or any of the others, for that matter - cannot be allowed to use the powers of the Gods. She doesn&apos;t understand what must be done. She doesn&apos;t understand how to rule.
The ship is awake, Godwoken. Now we can get away from this place.
&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; is my reward. My house burned down, my neighbours killed - and by Magisters, &lt;i&gt;one of whom I killed. &lt;/i&gt;And you would have me go out there unarmed?
Okay.
Anyway. You&apos;re Godwoken. I&apos;m Godwoken. And if you&apos;re anything like me, you&apos;ve got way too much going on at the moment and could use all the friends you can get.
Isn&apos;t it wonderful when a sweet and noble princess is delivered from evil? Gives one... hope. Even now.
Are you sure you want to discard your changes?
*Shake your head. You were curious - nothing more. You just wanted to know it all.*
*Ask how she can be sure that Isbeil is working for the God King.*
What&apos;s dead?
[IFAN] *Roll up your sleeves. Nothing like a fistfight to clear the head.*
*Explain that you found a purging wand in the vault.*
I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; so.
[BEAST] *Tell her you fear you can&apos;t do what you must do. Ask her to save your people.*
A large,  promising bar of iron, the core ingredient of any well-made steel.
*Say he sounds like a man after your own heart.*
*Ask why the elf owes him money.*
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
I. Take. You. Now. To. The. Arena. Of. The. One.
You freed me, lizard... I am in your debt! Allow me to help you... I still have enough power to unseal the Source barrier that blocks you...
I&apos;m something of a polymath, if you&apos;ll pardon the hot air. Inventing, healing... perhaps a little magic from time to time. Until recently, I was a prisoner of Dallis.
