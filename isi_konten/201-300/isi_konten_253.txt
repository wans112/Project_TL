Can smell the arrogance from here.
Kemm&apos;s Key
*Tell it you didn&apos;t really have much of a choice.*
No, not me. It was my bloody neighbours - soft hearts an&apos; softer wits, the lot of them.  I did the right thing, let the Magisters know what was going on...
I&apos;m so glad you came, but your friends will have to leave.
As you wish, sire. As you know, the House of Shadows stirs. Assassins had me cornered. And so I took the last, desperate action left open to me: I fled bodily into the dream realm. This is my world now. To Rivellon I can never return.
*She looks bereft.*
*Say you wish to return to Rivellon now.*
You have a predilection for promises, do you not? Let&apos;s hope you intend to fulfil them. For your sake.
*He screams but does not wake.*
Thank you for your... enthusiastic participation.
Plunder the tombs.
*Though she briefly touches the names on her arm, her face settles into a blank and inscrutable expression.*
For help with my contract I must contact a Magister Borris in the ghetto of Fort Joy. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be delightful.
Kemm has an appraiser in the house. Could mean a big payday.

Glass of Wine
*Ask about Lohar. What&apos;s his role in all this?*
*She looks up at you through tear-stained eyes, but you can see her resolve hardening as she remembers who she is and what she stands for.*
[OUTLAW] *Explain that you&apos;re just trying to stay ahead of the game.*
*She gestures at the entangled corpses, vines still spattering gore onto the deck.*
Warmest of greetings to you, friend.
Ye gods. See what I have to put up with?! Thanks for the help. Thanks for nuffink at all.
Intimidate
Oh, make no mistake. I&apos;m not asking you to support &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;at the Wellspring - just not to be beholden to &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. To think for yourself. To make choices that you think are right - not what some half-dead God demands.
*Hand her your book of research.*
Arhu is dead, but his spirit may still linger.
Jahan... You gave me the demon&apos;s name... Adramahlihk! Too powerful... Possessed...
I&apos;m a Seeker. Name&apos;s Gareth. And I dare say you&apos;re a Sourcerer. I can help you.
*Tell it that, refreshing though that was, you&apos;re still hungry...*
Running with the Pack
Goblin Grunt
Enough! If you won&apos;t heed my warnings then maybe some time in the cells will teach you some manners!
*He clicks the gauntlet into place around his withered forearm, his eyes on you the whole time*
This town looks peaceful enough. Let&apos;s find out if looks deceive.
*Put her in check. Dwarves are not all drunkards and slobs.*
*Duggan lays his hand on her shoulder, squeezing it tight as tears roll down her cheeks.*
...and I&apos;m holding a quick and easy solution.
You have my gratitude.
Her blood dries on the stones, not mine. Good thing, too.
Pumpkin Part
Oh my. That dress could have paid a prince&apos;s ransom, you know.
Wait!
*Mention that you&apos;d like to see the ritual.*
You look like a boy to me.
Emberwing! You&apos;ll pay for that.
Monster-slayer coming through! Move aside there!
[MYSTIC] *You sense something more here - a presence. Place your palm against the door.*
Kemm&apos;s journal mentioned a vault beneath his garden.
*Nod in understanding. They&apos;re holding this witch prisoner, then?*
Lucian the Faithbringer
Black Mirror
We found Gareth in an abandoned farmhouse, standing over an unconscious White Magister. What&apos;s going on?
And mine! Mine too! Thank you!
it ends with the punchline:
Inhale...
I smell Source in the air. And something else, too. Something... rancid.
Oh, honey. I&apos;m not a child. In this world, &lt;i&gt;everyone&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; looking for drama.
Magister Carver won&apos;t see this town flooded with Voidwoken because we let one of those wretches roam free.
For one thousand years I have had to listen to prattle. No, it is time to act.
*The Source flows out of the jar, across your bones, and into your skull. For a brief moment you glimpse the universe, and then it&apos;s gone. You&apos;re left panting, filled with incredible power.*
Got to come up with something... can&apos;t keep her locked up forever...
There is still much you don&apos;t know. There is still hope.
Puts out fires, heals characters, creates blessed water surfaces.

*Question what has the princess in such a foul mood.*
an item
Make yourself comfortable. First-rate entertainment, this is.
Dead Trader&apos;s Leg
*He dips his head in acknowledgement and turns away.*
First you come to me and you buy yourself some drudanae. That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; step one. Next you put some leaves into one of &apos;em slots, and pull the lever next to it to lead a flame right on underneath &apos;em.
It has the shape of Rhalic, but speaks the tongue of beasts. How cruel.
See that, &lt;i&gt;adventurer? &lt;/i&gt;That&apos;s Lawre Godfray and Gye Fallchard. They were my friends. &lt;i&gt;Their&lt;/i&gt; friends, too; Fortimere, Gale, Adlard and Jupp. Those four Paladins left their posts, and now their friends are dead.
*Say you aren&apos;t in the mood for philosophical conversation with a rat, and step away.*
*This seems suspicious. Why would he help you?*
[IFAN] *Nod: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Ifan&apos;s the name.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Did better&apos;n you, Sir Gareth!
&lt;i&gt;Glechou dumar, glechou dumar...&lt;/i&gt;
We are no fools... but... the Divine protects the realm at &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;costs, no matter how high.

*Necromancy.*
Orivand&apos;s Spare Mace
*Hear her out.*
Something&apos;s wrong about this place. Easy now...
*Tell him to spit it out, then.*
*Tatcher gives you a grin. Edden turns back to her drink.*
If she desires to speak to me, I will listen.
Such a pity that fella had to die! But at least they didn&apos;t make him silent. Such horrors, those silent ones!
*Just watch her. You love just watching her.*
*Tell her the truth. You met Tir-Cendelius, and he told you that she, Lohse, was a liability.*
*She was the one who sat rolling dice in the ship that went under, &apos;deciding fates&apos; with every roll - or so she said.*
I&apos;m grateful that the Sourcerer is no more. Even if his end was needlessly violent.
[LOHSE] *Tell her true: you are Lohse, the famed musician.*
*Wait - Braccus hid their souls in a vault guarded by traps which &lt;i&gt;they &lt;/i&gt;designed?*
The Godwoken has come, as I foresaw. And as I feared.
Tomb of Halla
*Tell him it was a good choice to make: a chance for everyone to do good by the Source.*
Reunited at last! I must say, those bugs seemed rather intelligent. They split us perfectly.
Lord Arhu has returned! Some good news, at last.
Crimson Amulet
*Ask the spirit if he knows a way out of here.*
[SCHOLAR] *Amadia, yes. The pig should move to the Shrine of Amadia. She might convene with her goddess there.*
An ancient inscription in the Nameless Isle cave indicated a fire rune must be offered to the Dragon&apos;s Mouth to proceed.
Fear
I SERVT! I SERVT THE GOT KING! RISE ME UP! RISE ME UP, GOT KING!
*Tell the Magister that you saw a pair of glasses discarded in the grass to the East of Driftwood. He must have slipped out that way.*
The Tree of Ghalann
I&apos;d feel sorry for you, poppet, but death is a gift. Trust me on that one...
Search the Wreckers&apos; Cave.
*Take him at his word. Then tell him you want the stolen gear back.*
Careful; don&apos;t want to catch Griff in a bad mood.
&lt;i&gt;Sir&lt;/i&gt; Gareth. He&apos;s the finest Seeker I know - I&apos;m h-honoured to serve as his squire. He wouldn&apos;t let us down... not unless something&apos;s g-gone horribly wrong...
Well... bugger. Had to happen eventually, I suppose.
The food... hemlock...
*Ask what happened here.*
Tattered Tome
Ssso. You win the prize. The God King shall have your Sssource!
Seven curse these fiends! Sadha! Where have you gone?
Holding the &apos;Tracks of the Tyrant&apos; gives one an odd crippling sensation.
&lt;i&gt;...you are not enough... you were never enough...&lt;/i&gt;
*Thank her for the information.*
*A grim-faced man sifts through a pile of badly damaged weapons, salvaging the repairable, ditching the broken. He picks up a rapier, the blade nicked and splintered, the hilt twisted.*

Well, I&apos;m not interested in any more torture, thank you very much. Pick on somebody your own size!
Honourable Dallis,&lt;br&gt;We lost a ship sailing Sourcerer prisoners to Fort Joy.&lt;br&gt;We assume some escaped and broke their collars.&lt;br&gt;Their vile magic lured the Voidwoken.&lt;br&gt;All who were aboard are presumed dead.&lt;br&gt;Yours faithfully into eternity,&lt;br&gt;High Judge Orivand
*Push yourself up, against the sword&apos;s edge; feel it press into your skin as the figure holds it fast, trying to keep you in place.*
But don&apos;t you worry, beautiful. I wouldn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;dream &lt;/i&gt;of betraying your... secret.
Attack: [1] Action Point(s)&lt;br&gt;
That undead witch. Heard her talking about some kind of covenant.
Large Poison Resistance Potion
*She&apos;s too far gone - attack.*
This is... this is... this is... NOT frustrating. And you are not a clever creature, not having rumbled my quandary. Get me?
*Tell her you spent time in Fort Joy yourself. The Magisters who ran it were mostly merciless.*
Sit
I can&apos;t let you take them, Roost. You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; me. You know you can trust me. So, believe me when I say this is bigger than any contract.
I remember this one. His name was Kerban.
*Of course! Draw your weapon and offer to kill him.*
Exploration Theme 11 Mystic A
*Agree and be on your way.*
I have nothing more to offer you. But if you&apos;ve come to offer yourself as my next meal, I won&apos;t argue.
We consumed Sech Zapor&apos;s soul.
He brought me back from the Hall of Echoes, locked my soul away, and demanded my obedience. Even in death he commanded me.
*Sneer at him. History has proven that a larger force does not guarantee victory.*
Killer Instinct
And what&apos;s more, you&apos;ve brought it all the way here. &lt;i&gt;To me.&lt;/i&gt; Why?
Constrained
Will we escape the Merryweather?
And you are my child. We are both of the other. Bound together when the Void would see us torn apart.
*She spits three bloody teeth out on the floor beside your feet and grins crimson at you.*
Gods help me!
Oh don&apos;t be ridiculous. I have important things to do on Reaper&apos;s Coast.
I know drudanae when I see it. Griff must be jonesing mightily for his next hit.
*Suck a tiny amount of his Source. It&apos;s tough, but you keep control.*
Skewered Black Ring Corpse
*Gareth nods slowly.*
Quiet, you. Now. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken. &lt;/i&gt;You know what you must do.
*Clear your throat. Isn&apos;t it normally polite to thank your rescuers?*
Miaow! I admit I&apos;m licking my chops, but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be curling up in your lap any time soon!
Disembodied Hand
Master! Master! Wake up! Master! Wake! Up!
Snakeskin Armour
We approached the Path of Blood. Will we be judged righteous, and allowed to pass?
*Tell him you wish to do battle, Murga be damned.*
Blessed Smoke Cloud Skillbook
Bloody thing&apos;s been boarded up. Not very well, though...
You can hit the ground or surfaces with your weapon by holding [IE_DestructionToggle] + [IE_Action1] and then clicking terrain.
Gossip? Oh, I don&apos;t gossip. I just tell it like it is.
*The spirit bows his head, crestfallen.*
*Urge him to tell you more about the dwarven rebellion.*
Pants of Amity
&lt;i&gt;Excellent&lt;/i&gt;, Godwoken. You show true finesse in your actions.
I guess things are about to get... erm... interesting.
*Raise an eyebrow. What song does he mean?*
*Tell it you trust its instincts. You&apos;ll look into it.*
You have to love that cheery jingle-jangle as you walk...
Ah. I didn&apos;t like the look in their eyes. Sure you didn&apos;t either.
