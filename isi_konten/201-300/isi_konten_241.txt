So? How does it feel? Giving away divinity like it were nothing more than an old shoe?
Least I went down doing what I loved!
*Thank Brahmos for his loyal service.*
Xiuh
&lt;i&gt;Every falling feather judges your heart. &lt;/i&gt;
Thankfully there are answers to be found. I simply need to get to Reaper&apos;s Coast. To return to the Blackpits excavation site...
Be gone from me, traitor. You betray us. You betray all of us.
That was &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;ma. Mine. How could you let them get her?
*Tell her that you discovered the ship&apos;s little secret - soon they&apos;ll upon the high seas, far away from the Magisters. She should settle in for a long stay.*
*Tell him to broach it anyway.*
If you ask me, the fact that Murga caught a Voidwoken just proves she&apos;s using dirty tricks...
Free, free, free, free, FREE! Do I look as good as I feel? Don&apos;t answer that. I do.
I!
[IFAN] *Heft your weapon and tell her bad news is your specialty.*
Sand Spider Matriarch
Are you dense?! I told you already to keep your nose out of it.
They were living weapons: made of flesh and reared in torture. The pain they endured was so terrible their screams turned to solid lightning.
*Coughs* How can you stand it?
&lt;i&gt;Voidwoken?!&lt;/i&gt;
Burning Skeletons - Any
Well, keep steady. People still need potions. They&apos;ll be by soon enough.
Like I said, the Magisters have a lot to answer for.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Look at him skeptically. Ask how he responded to their questions.*
I do hope you will fight. You interest me.
[MYSTIC] *Claim that you sense an aura to him. Dark deeds carried out by his hands.*
Render Almira a service.
Camera Backward
Are you simple? Perform the ritual! Ingredients in the cupboard, ritual in the book, Source in the fountain. *Cough* Go!
You can&apos;t afford my silence!
*You&apos;re curious: his people, the Eternals - what were they like?*
&lt;i&gt;...face the inescapable truth... you are not enough...&lt;/i&gt;
I didn&apos;t agree to that. Go find some other dwarf to be chummy with.
She is free from the Covenant, at least. Whether she still escapes the God King&apos;s notice, I cannot say.
I want no trouble from you, lizard. This job is dull and I&apos;d like to keep it that way.
Failed to create rendering device!
&lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt; help us!
Lord Iovan: Opponent of Earth
Leather Cover
Alright, move along there, you may be wiser than you look, but you&apos;re of no more use to me.
I met your old buddy Jahan, if that&apos;s what you mean.
Free of Isbeil&apos;s influence, Queen Justinia may return to the kingdom. Under a new Divine, she may yet be redeemed.
Huh, some bloody help you were!
*Together you plunge the blade deep into Sarias&apos;s heart, then twist it three times, as is the custom. Blood flows freely to the ground, and Sarias&apos;s heart lies neatly cut in four.*
We attacked the little girl. The demon took her soul. She died.
The&lt;i&gt; sewers? &lt;/i&gt;My, but the famed Isbeil has sunk low, hasn&apos;t she? Well. The stench should suit her, at least. She&apos;s got an affinity for rot and decay, even more than your everyday Black Ring crony.
*Smile and tell her to hold her horses! You&apos;ve only just met!*
*The spirit of the dwarf lies still.*
She was imprisoned on the Lady Vengeance, one of the few of us not left to rot on the sand and sun. All the more vital we take the ship from the Magisters.
Reaper&apos;s Coast struggled on.
*A demonologist? Ask if she thinks there&apos;s a demon inside you.*
The demons of the realms - the souls they&apos;re destroying, enslaving. Souls just like me. I need to stop them. I can bring balance back to Rivellon.
*Sink back. This is the end.*
Indeed... indeed, as they should.
*Wish for power.*
*Tell her that, come to think of it, you&apos;re quite allergic to slime, and that her and your anatomy interwined would most probably lead you to an all too early grave.*
*Swear that you&apos;re not dangerous, you just want to get out of here.*
Did she ever deal with her demons?
Until later, then.
*Tell Sebille you&apos;re impressed. You had thought she&apos;d go straight for the throat.*
Life Steal
The living annoy me enough as it stands. I&apos;ve no interest in palavering with the damnable dead!
Well, that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;inconvenient&lt;/i&gt;.
*You look at the devastation that surrounds you. Is that what happened here?*
Ha! Cheeky. What&apos;s your name?
*Say you&apos;ve seen divinity wielded as a weapon before; it&apos;s not a good look.*
Looks like someone cleared out of this nook in a hurry.
The details aren&apos;t important now. It&apos;s just... never mind. Another entangling alliance. But I won&apos;t be able to disentangle it on my own. There may come a time when I need to count on &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;as an ally.
Well, yes. Getting out of here means taking a ship - a Magister ship. And they&apos;re not just going to give one to us out of the goodness of their hearts.
We have a report that someone matching your description was seen making off with a necklace.
A contract taken out by the Lone Wolves: no Godwoken is to be left alive.
[NOBLE] *Say this comes as no surprise. Your reputation precedes you, as it should.*
Summon Fire Slug
Grog-Splashed Pirate
And you, Lohse Divine.
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes. I daresay I&apos;m more than of note however - my historical volumes line bookshelves throughout all of Rivellon!
*Say that doesn&apos;t sound all that bad.*
*So she&apos;s implying you must steal the powers of the other gods? That makes you feel rather uncomfortable.*
Amadia
*Say that you want to deal with the decaying shroud hanging over the region first.*
Must be Ryker&apos;s place. Only a madman would build a mansion on the edge of a graveyard...
*All of a sudden he grips you firmly by the chin, with the intent of inspecting your teeth.*
DOST THOU STEAL?
*The grieving mother manages a thin smile, even as tears stream down her ruddy face.*
Ha! I knew there&apos;d be some good lines in there! &apos;Quiverin&apos; lump?&apos; Too funny to be mad at.
Turn Time
Your words warm my heart, Sourcerer.
*She reaches greedily for the jar, tearing the cap off.*
Emerald Necklace
Bring the evidence to Magister Julian.
Well... at least she&apos;s out there... somewhere. Maybe she&apos;ll come back! Some day...
You are frustrated because you are proud. You are a lizard, through and through.
*Raise your eyebrows. Where is Alexandar now?*
Well, I bet I can guess who was involved. These little bastards are everywhere. If we hear of anything we&apos;ll be sure to let you know. We wish you a safe and peaceful time during the rest of your stay.
Spider&apos;s Kiss
Bandit Ruffian
Sorry, Mary-Laine. I forgot. *Sniff.*
*Smile coyly and ask him for his name. You&apos;ve just the spot for it on your arm.*
&lt;i&gt;Godwoken. You know what you must do.&lt;/i&gt;
He must trust you if you&apos;ve met him and survived. Can you lure him out of the town, and see that justice is done?
*Tell the wretched creature he&apos;s probably better off in his cage for now.*
...L, M, N, O - *COUGH! HACK!*
*Say his reputation as a powerful Sourcerer is unparalleled. You simply had to meet!*
Not my plans. Its plans - the presence within. It shows me such things.
Papa...?
What my friend here &lt;i&gt;means&lt;/i&gt; to say, kind sir, is that there&apos;s a cure for our condition. Alice Alisceon has it in her house. If we could drink it, we could then regain our former forms, as it were, and steal away.
A Shrieker, I&apos;ll wager.
Left Alt
[MYSTIC] *Stay still. Stay silent. Watch as the creature eats.*
Watch your tongue. I&apos;m after a wanted man, a tinkerer, but I could still find time to haul you into a cell.
Stay back. The thief stays where she is.
*The man looks for a moment at the corpse at his feet, then turns back toward the nearly-finished coffin, bloodied hammer in hand.*
*The lizard&apos;s brow knits together, then apart, and back again. He seems to be swimming deep in his thoughts and doesn&apos;t look up as you approach.*
By Duna&apos;s dagger, sister! You here to free us, or kill us?
Adventurous, confident, flexible, at times even clever, humans are dominant in Rivellon. They always play the hero in their own endless wars… even when they’re the villains.
...dwarven voices silenced, hope suppressed.
*Say she didn&apos;t answer your question. Who &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;this person?*
Perhaps not. But I know the wilds are all the wilder as the Void encroaches. Do you agree... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt;
Like a trap ready to snap shut when I say &apos;when&apos;.
Dammit. That doesn&apos;t sound like I thought it would sound at&lt;i&gt; all! &lt;/i&gt;I still don&apos;t have the hang of this catchphrase thing.
*As you approach the silken-robed noble, Ifan does a double-take and laughs in recognition. He pulls you to one side.*
*Remind her you saved her from certain death back on that ship. Is this how she intends to repay your kindness?*
Acid-Stained Chest
*Say you would expect someone of the same race to be a little more... forgiving.*
*He drapes one hand on the hilt of his shortsword and gives you a tired look. A look that says &apos;try me&apos;.*
*Ask how you can help.*
Godwoken. I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s nothing I can teach you, to help with what lies ahead. Perhaps one of the others can still be of service.
You won&apos;t get anything out of me - not one word!
[LOHSE] *You see the sadness in his eyes and ask him about the broken rapier.*
Resist the pull of the demon.
*Hold one hand in the air and, tell her you serve the God King.*
*Alright. Agree not to open the chest.*
Really?
They call you a savage, an animal. They don&apos;t know what it&apos;s like to need to fight, tooth and claw, just to survive. You do.
Same as I&apos;ve been doin&apos;: sittin&apos; here and suffering!
Controller Context Menu
*Tell her that it was a pleasure to do what you could, and take your leave.*
*Ask her if she recognises that name - Jahan! So he&apos;s a Sourcerer as well as a demonologist...*
The docks are restricted to all but the White Magisters.
On your way then. She&apos;s over there, watching the match with those &lt;i&gt;skulls &lt;/i&gt;to keep her company...
Another forgotten king from another forgotten time.
I don&apos;t begrudge you your freedom, Sebille. Your escape relieved me of having to witness your death by your own hand: the inevitable last command.
It&apos;s quite the pickle.
*Change the subject.*
*Ask if it was worth it.*
&lt;br&gt;Boost: [1][2]%
*Laslor? Tell her you met her brother in Fort Joy.*
*She turns and eyes you coldly.*
My mission has a name: Adramahlihk. He is the fiend that possesses your friend Lohse, but worry not: we&apos;ll find him, and we&apos;ll undo him.
Now, they can say nothing. They had no chance against the Voidwoken. My brother&apos;s so-called gift was only a lure.
*Her face wrinkles, and she stares at you intently.*
We do my favourite thing in all the world: we sail! The Council of Seven awaits, lad. Though if we dally among the waves, you won&apos;t find me complainin&apos;.
*You&apos;ve saved the city from the Voidwoken at the gate, and you&apos;ll save it from Dallis. What does he know?*
I was a &lt;i&gt;scholar&lt;/i&gt;, researching the secrets of the universe!
I&apos;m sorry, I remain... unconvinced. A smaller sum, that I can do. But a loan of this scale is too big a risk - for me, as well as for you.
Dear me, it has questions, Quercus!
*Scoff. So he wants you to do his legwork for him.*
Fatal Claymore
We found the Advocate and his minions.
