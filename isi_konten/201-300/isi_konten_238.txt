Heard a kid singing that the other day. Her mother heard it too and beat the poor tyke senseless.
*He starts to swipe and jab his sword at an unseen opponent.*

Never.
Uru Joph
*Busy caressing Atusa&apos;s severed leg and gibbering happily, he fails to notice you.*
It is as if I am being chilled from the inside out. I have become ice, frozen by an unimaginably black shadow.
*Apologise to the guard for Beast&apos;s behaviour.*
Did you know that you can place objects into containers? Highlight an object, press [IE_ControllerContextMenu] and select &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;&apos;Hold&apos;&lt;/font&gt;. Then, move the cursor to a container and press [IE_UIAccept] to drop the object in there.
*She has you at a disadvantage. Ask her who &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;is, and why she is here.*
Nice song. Don&apos;t give up the day job. If you have one.
*You feel the thing lurch forward in fury, straining against your will. Release it, let it speak.*
Marge? Marge! Oh, Marge! She was a good sort.
There&apos;s magic in the air, wouldn&apos;t you say?
*Tell him you&apos;ve already learned how to teleport - so what&apos;s this about an escape?*
Mordus scratched out a living, ending up as a short-order cook.

Such as?
But... but... I thought...
What are you up to now, my dear?
Get Rory&apos;s attention.
Ready?
*You feel good - the little bear learned something just now. It learned that the world can be harsh, and often random. It grew up a little. The cub looks at you like you&apos;re crazy.*
Awww, ain&apos;t that as sweet as a bowl full of peaches! Hate to be &lt;i&gt;this guy&lt;/i&gt;, but I gotta break up the party now.
*Grab a dagger and gleefully drive its tip into his belly.*
*Tell him to go on - but it had better be good!*
*Ask how she feels about Lucian.*
Ah, sir? Her &lt;i&gt;armour -&lt;/i&gt;
*The demon possessing him wasn&apos;t very helpful, but does &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;know anything about what Malady was doing here?*
I chose well.
Yer call! Not everyone can rise to Murga&apos;s levels. She&apos;s got enough venom to put a snake to shame.
Made of wheat grown in the Rivellonian Grain Belt, this finely-milled flour is a primary ingredient in a variety of local delicacies.

Key
And to think she was so near to us - to &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; - all this time... it seems I owe you my thanks... and a reward...
Not the most elegant solution, was it?
Are you looking for a fight?
Helllllooo?
A vial of blood labelled &apos;Garvan&apos;
I acquiesced to the Mother Tree and took root. I am the heart of all elvendom and the hope of the elves. I must become Divine.
General
*He shrugs off your touch and turns from you, eyes wet.*
Elven Temple
*Beast&apos;s spirit hums a slow tune as you near and holds his fingernails up to examine them. He does not wish to chat.*
*As you watch, it transforms to a bear, claws digging into the earth as it struggles to dislodge the log. You blink and it turns again - a gorilla now, its vaulted back pushing hard against the wood.*
Trickster
Ain&apos;t ever been big on humankind, but that verse makes me feel a little more respect for &apos;em, ya know?
*Gareth shies away from you. His eyes pass over the half-filled graves and he takes a shuddering breath.*
Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. A god no less.
I&apos;ve suffered enough. Why would I ever want to return to a world doomed to suffer under the Gods? I should have never left the lamp.
The garden, at least, is unscathed.
*Ahem* Who&apos;s asking?
*Tell her to go on.*
*Tell her you want nothing at all.*
Look, Sourcerer. I know what you are. And neither of us is safe here. I&apos;ll mark a sanctuary on your map. Go - and soon. You&apos;ll always have a place at our table.
Chest of a Human Hero
They were Divine Order, just like us! They were-
Alex
*Tell Marg that you met another troll recently, a troll by the name of Grog.*
*The Seeker gazes upward, right at the sun. She mumbles rapidly to herself.*
Heading into the kitchen? Don&apos;t try anything funny around Griff. I&apos;m watching you.
&lt;i&gt;O we dwarves had a kingdom, and we &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; have it back!&lt;br&gt;I won&apos;t always be sweeping, I&apos;ll be riding horseback!&lt;br&gt;O we dwarves had a kingdom, and a proud knight was I!&lt;br&gt;I won&apos;t always be sweeping, for my kingdom I&apos;ll die!&lt;/i&gt;
*Attack her. She&apos;s too far gone.*
I&apos;d rather you not roam where you&apos;re not invited. &lt;i&gt;If you could be so kind.&lt;/i&gt;
*Laugh and beg the valiant knight not to slay you.*
I have nothing more for you. No food. No words. Get out.
*Smile and say that the good turn will stand to her. Maybe you&apos;ll be able to repay the favour in the future.*
Got your hands on my Sparkler, did you? Well. Put it to good use. The louses I have at the card table could use a good shake-up.
In the untouched garden of the ruined consulate we found a magical portal. Perhaps answers lie beyond.
Go. Git. Gone. Closer-come, closer-dying.
Play the Lute
*He ends the liturgy, and jerks his head up to you in annoyance.*
Nevertheless I must admit that even to sit on that throne amid that eerie crowd, destined to become leaf and bark, was not so dreadful a prospect as what came next.
Bock.
*Say you may be able to help, but you&apos;ll need to know what happened here first.*
*Leave the girl where she is.*
And where else would you have had me turn? Each path led to my sure end; this was the only one in which I could see any future at all for our people.
Who the hells be yow?
I once chose peace. Today - I did not. Yet I know I chose right. Should Lucian snub me in the Hall, my pride is still mine. I am prepared for him to rebuke me; it is the price of loyalty.
Something&apos;s happening. That must have been the last lever!
You have come to your senses; of this I am certain.
*Silent, hold his gaze. If the gods had real power, they wouldn&apos;t need followers.*
Magical Scale Boots
*Cock an eyebrow. If he&apos;s hatching an escape plan, you want in.*
[MYSTIC] *Say the gods need to believe in you and Ifan more than the other way around.*
*Grasp her arm and ask her where those welts came from.*
A lot of choice, I know. Something else I can help you with then?
Sword
Deer Die
The Red Prince believes that Sadha is at the Ancient Empire consulate.
*Paint him a vivid picture of exactly where you&apos;ll put that dagger if he doesn&apos;t take it away from your throat.*
Hmm. Maybe it&apos;s true, what ya say. Never seen a boy with a flute leadin&apos; a line o&apos; bewitched rats, fer sure.
Easy, hairbag, or I&apos;ll root you to the ground and call a Voidwoken to show you the true meaning of terror. Muah-hah!
*Leave Gareth to his task.*
*Agree.*
Alexandar, son of Lucian the Divine, was also a Godwoken. He was tutored by Dallis&apos; associate, Vredeman. Hopefully it wasn&apos;t a mistake to kill him.
I told you, this place&apos;s off limits.
Electric Discharge
*As you drain his power you feel his panic rising in your chest. You feel his memories fill you. You feel the power of his Source flooding your body.*
No better place to shine a light than in the heart of darkness.
They... they take her life. Like it is nothing. An item on a list.
*A ghostly cacophony reaches your ears... the snarls of a beast, and the screams of a man... the priestess lunges forward to help someone unseen.*
*Change the subject. This is a little too much...*
All g-g-g-glory to Lucian, all prayers to him. P-p-p-please, &lt;i&gt;Lucian&lt;/i&gt;, end my suffering...
Thanks to you, Lohse, a new age is soon to dawn.
I&apos;m sorry, it&apos;s not about the money.
Let go of me! Let go, &lt;i&gt;please!&lt;/i&gt; Those &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; could come back at any moment...
Throw a Voidling forwards
...or some other deadly cargo.

Power, it corrupts so far. The innocent are first to fall...
*It makes a demand: Tell it if you&apos;ve killed another Godwoken.*
Sticky Location
*He nods with a determined grimace.*
Arx! She&apos;s in the city of Arx! I recognise the cathedral from paintings in my palace.
I&apos;ll not take that from the least &apos;natural&apos; creatures to walk this land.
Well, what fortune! It just so happens that we need one dead...
What do you want, air-breather?
Demonic Stare
You have interrupted my newest masterpiece!
*Tell her you&apos;ll go where you please. Your search for Lord Arhu takes precedence over her petty concerns.*
I... I wasn&apos;t expecting &lt;i&gt;this.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say no; the system is too confusing.*
Well what have we here? Looks like these came right from the traitor-queen&apos;s court.
Everyone&apos;s in charge of their own fate. Sounds to me like this&apos;n sent his down the drain.
I am blessed, shadow-veil, by drudanae and divinity. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
The Queen of Pearls. Duna&apos;s mistress, the tales say.
Blue Necklace

*&apos;In honour of Rhalic, first of the Gods, and patron of humanity.&apos;*
*The candles glow with the light of the spirits housed by each. They reach toward Lohse, eager to be heard.*
Bloom of Might
*He drops a lazy hand on your map, leaving a dent where you can apparently find the Yarrow. He already looks more content, despite not actually having smoked any of the Drudane just yet.*
*The skeleton reaches into the folds of his robes and pulls out a small, black mass. It&apos;s covered in veins, oozing pus, and seems to be missing a piece. He presents it with a faint grin.*
Aye.
Nah, I&apos;m joshin&apos; ya. Scammed it off a drunken elf in the tavern a few years back. No offence. But still. The wife&apos;ll be furious.
[SEBILLE] *Say that your spoiled face is the last thing he&apos;ll ever see.*
What a boor.
The throne of the gods is mine. To stand in my way is to invite one&apos;s own annihilation.
I gave you a chance, and you blew it!
*But the great Mother Tree speaks of death and domination. You hate her. You flee from her, only to end in a strange land among unkind strangers. First Roost... then the dreaded &lt;i&gt;Master.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Suddenly, a vision coalesces. You see yourself - the bright and zealous crusader you once were. You are breathless, scouting through deep forest. You are racing with a message of utmost importance for the elven people.*
You made it all the way here, you creeping little maggots? Have you wriggled up to bow to me? Has Lohar sent you to beg forgiveness for his sins?
*The craftmistress observes you with unveiled disdain.*
*Ask where you can find the Shadow Prince.*
Captain Ablewether&apos;s magic compass went down with her ship, on the rocks somewhere west along the coast.
*Sigh.* You do nothing wrong. I am not myself. This place.&lt;i&gt; Fay-ah&lt;/i&gt;.
[JESTER] *Say you heard Slane call, and you have come to take his mortality.*
Seven years? What an infinitesimal period! Why would anyone...
Sir, he only -
*Beast claps him on the back and chuckles heartily. If they hadn&apos;t met just a moment ago, you might think the dwarves lifelong friends.*
It&apos;s my job.
Join the surplus. Okay. Bye. *sniffle*
You are infamous: a brilliant warrior-general exiled from his empire for cavorting with demons. Fallen from grace, you refuse to give up. The throne will be yours again.
