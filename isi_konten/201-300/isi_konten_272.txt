*A long, low growl from one of those strange hounds surrounding the creature stops you in your tracks. She leans forward, peering at you curiously.*
This delicate ring is a token of your bond with the Red Princess.

Someone, aid me!
This shell bears a pilgrim&apos;s mark. It looks quite useless but perhaps you could combine it with something to make it worth a prayer?
Tommilyn&apos;s Farmhouse
Geomancer Skillbook
You waste my time!
The demon. He keeps our souls... he keeps them all forever... I see it all... I see it all...
Game Paused
I&apos;ve little to say to one who parleys with Magisters. Yes, indeed that&apos;d be &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
Here within these pages lies my last will and testament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a life it has been, and no companion more true to me than my own dear pampered piglet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, I bequeath, in perpetuity, all of my worldly belongings to she who lit up my life the most: Lulabelle.
My... my &lt;i&gt;head &lt;/i&gt;hurts...
You&apos;re not supposed to be here! Just &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;do you think you&apos;re doing?
Human Ankh
Shield
*Relent and give him the ring.*
Poor little baby. What happened to yeh? Don&apos;t you worry - I&apos;ll fix yeh right up. Get ya singin&apos; to the heavens again before too long.
*Push away his arm, saying you&apos;ll go first.*
I thought I&apos;d heard the last of him. You almost have to admire his persistence.
*Say you&apos;d be happy to help.*
(end)
*Hiss you&apos;re obviously after his cash. So give it up! Right. Goddamn. Now!*
Gods&lt;i&gt;damn&lt;/i&gt;. What manner of creature lies to a dead man?
*Reach a hand out to him. Steady him with your grip.*
Right you are. Lead the way.
*It&apos;s probably three. Try that.*
It&apos;s hard to believe - but someone actually finished the Path of Blood!
*Tell him the Red Prince is asking!*
The dead don&apos;t care. It&apos;s the living who should be fearful.
Pulled back from the brink of death... only to be killed again moments later. Bloody shambles.
What&apos;s it to you?
Ah. &lt;i&gt;There &lt;/i&gt;you are.
I can&apos;t believe this is nearly over. After everything we&apos;ve been through, the end&apos;s in sight...
Go ahead and ignore me. But you should know it&apos;s not just &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;freedom at stake.
*Beaming widely, he hands you a bucket and a seedling, before patting your hands affectionately.*
*The servant&apos;s groans reverberate through the chamber. With a harsh wave, it commands you to step back.*
A dream... A dream... No more...
*Tell her you&apos;re here for the wedding.*
I searched this island for a Dreamer: one of the mystics of my kind that can travel the dream world at will, as if it were another realm just as real as our own.
*Bow and assure him you&apos;re completely trustworthy.*
And if their barracks turns out to be empty as their skulls, just try to keep an ear to the ground. There may still be powerful Sourcerers hiding in these lands.
You off to hunt, lizard? Better stock up.
Spirit of Vilnx Creeva
*Answer her that you have truly no idea.*
This is what I mean. You&apos;ve got to make up your mind. Stand for something.
It&apos;s the waiting that gets you.
Of course there are other forms of protocol to bear in mind, but I&apos;ll see to it you&apos;ll pick up the rest as we go. So without further ado: let us be off!
*You are a Magister and proud. You did what you could, and you did what was right. And now it is over. The world and its problems are no longer your concern. Now you may leave.*
Void-Touched Beastmaster
[1] surrendered. Not that it did them any good.
With you at my side - you &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;the Shield - I will not fail.
Cobalt
*Look about you. Tell her it feels especially claustrophobic in here.*
*Muse that you would like a little more &lt;i&gt;barbarity &lt;/i&gt;in your nature.*
&lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt; Don&apos;t look at me like that.
*Demand to know more about the arena you just survived. Was that his doing also?*
Please. Stop talking. Please.
*Say you weren&apos;t implying anything; rather you were referring to the conversation you had.*
Kemm is sworn to the God King. He held Arhu prisoner to control access to Lucian&apos;s tomb.
*White hot pain... fangs sinking into you... a Magister appears and offers her hand. You reach for it... but there&apos;s a loud &lt;i&gt;snarl&lt;/i&gt;. Warm blood soaks you, then darkness.*
Hah. Come on then. Let&apos;s see what you&apos;re made of.
Deal warily with Rajjarima, the supposed Godwoken.
*You have lit Isbeil&apos;s fire. She is a bomb, a banshee, an erupting volcano.*
Earth Immunity Aura
*The echoes of a distant past pervade the room as the spirit embarks upon a long lost tune.*
Even one life saved is a victory.
*Tell him the waiter motions for the dog to come in.*
*Snarl - he&apos;s lying.*
Ice Summon
*Sadha smiles at him so endearingly it almost melts &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; heart.*
Tsk tsk. Doing his dirty work only encourages him. I&apos;d have expected &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;to find some way to thwart his desires.
*The tree-form spirit slumbers on.*
You have not assigned heroes to all the available slots. Are you sure you want to continue?
Ma&apos;am! &lt;i&gt;Ma&apos;am! &lt;/i&gt;Quit thy poking and prithee leave yon Jimmy alone. Our lad will ruffle up his feathers in his own sweet time!
*Your link to the spirit is suddenly severed. She stands before you, head bowed.*
*Fane is slowly flicking through his notebook, reading over the notes he has taken on his journey.*
Release me from this torture. I beg you...
I&apos;m going to take a rest. Sort myself out. I suggest you do the same. Speak to the ship if you need me. She&apos;ll know where to find me.
There are soldiers here. Or knights, perhaps. They look... capable.
Crossbow Without Bowstring
I did not find one however, leaving me to search for a Dreamer on the mainland.
Atta boy! Who wouldn&apos;t?! Finally someone with a little sense around here.
[JESTER] *Search her for Mudbarrow&apos;s money.*
No bow or crossbow equipped&lt;br&gt;
Somebody else must have already helped Gawin escape.
Come. We&apos;d better have a look around.
[OUTLAW] *Ask her for a light.*
[MYSTIC] *Whisper the lullaby of the faithful - &lt;i&gt;Slumber of the Seven&lt;/i&gt; - over him.*
*Tovah looks to you...*
Bunny
*Say he sounds like quite the big man on deck.*
Tschhhhh... I doubt it could be better than my dear departed Mama&apos;s recipe! Tell me this, what&apos;s the most important bit?
Your Highness! You have found me!
The Red Prince will search Arx for Sadha.
&apos;Get away!&apos; &apos;Monster!&apos; &apos;Hide the children!&apos; Ugh.
Come here again, and you&apos;ll be fed to the flames!
To wit, we&apos;re taking all your stuff. If you want it back, you can take it up with Lohar.
Don&apos;t let fortune pass you by, now! Opportunity doesn&apos;t always knock twice!
*Her breath catches in her throat. Slowly she turns to you.*
Indeed? Slayed by your hand, then? The cub once pleaded with me to aid in his Sourcerer pogrom. I cannot deplore your actions, as loathe as I am to admit it.
*Tell her you should move on; there&apos;s plenty still ahead of you.*
*Laugh. Finally! You&apos;ve been trying to impress her since Fort Joy.*
Something was engraved on this item:
If you&apos;ll be pardonin&apos; me, I&apos;ll be much obliged.
*Trice shivers, then reaches up to fiddle frantically with the rope.*
Seven save us! Stabbed in the back he was, by those vile, lowborn, treacherous Seekers!
[MYSTIC] *Observe that they&apos;ve been here for far too long. What holds them to this place?*
*Grin widely. You certainly were!*
*Ask her if she really wants to give away her secret.*
*Tell him you like the trill of a feminine voice.*
Jolly nice for you, I expect. But this is a home for all who need one.
Good luck to you out there in that blasted place. You&apos;ll need it.
All
Do not fall amid the fray, Paladins! &lt;i&gt;Face them to the last!&lt;/i&gt;
Fang of the Void
*Step away.*
*You stretch out tired fingers as you hear the familiar click. Nine tumblers down, yet the lock remains fastened! Perhaps it senses your hubris? Nothing for it but to keep going.*
*Ask what&apos;s there to learn from these foul-smelling fish.*
That&apos;s what&apos;s on your mind...? At a time like this?! Disgusting.
From the tendrils of Source weaving around the metal band, you can tell this ring once belonged to a Sourcerer like yourself.
*You did not feel the sword blade enter your back.*
We found a bloodstained altar. It looks quite old.
It was her, wasn&apos;t it. The monster.
*Qanna&apos;s spirit convulses in response. Her ghostly arms reach out - not for help, but instead to flash you a final rude gesture.*
*The boy throws another stone across the river. It tumbles down the cliffside.*
Then you are not surprised they are so savage.
You! Yes, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, you oaf.  Help me to my feet and be quick about it!
Hey... hands off!
As if you had the money to cut that kind of deal.
Bring Radeka&apos;s Purging Wand to Slane.
An empty bottle reeking of some rotten liquid that used to be inside.
And my sources tell me he&apos;s headed somewhere called the Nameless Isle. I&apos;ll be setting sail there myself any day now to take him out. &lt;i&gt;Your&lt;/i&gt; failure has put the reputation of &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;wolves at stake.
Are you sure you want to proceed to character creation level to reroll party characters? Your game will also unlock players number and new players will be able to join.
Ah. This is Dorian Gall&apos;s slug-making machine.
It&apos;s sailed all the seven seas; your belly is the last frontier.
But you&apos;ve come this far under the Meistr&apos;s tutelage, have you not? Don&apos;t kid yourself. You&apos;ve probably slain more by now than I &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; did.
*Say you&apos;re here to speak with Micheil Ros. Lohar sent you.*
Exit
NYAH HA HA!
Deadeye
[LOHSE] *Say you&apos;re a daft hand with wood. Lutes, mops, peg legs...*
*Tell her to just confess - who&apos;s in the stew.*
*Ask what she&apos;ll do next.*
Godwoken are being hunted by Lone Wolves, led by my old boss Roost. Last I heard, he was in Driftwood.
Magical Iron Gloves
*Tell her not to be so dramatic. You&apos;re both Eternals, after all. You cannot simply die!*
*Her mouth falls open, but she does not respond. Instead, she shakes and sobs.*
Available Talents:
To bypass the Path of Blood, we need the Scroll of Atonement - it may be found close to the amulet.
Carve and chisel a piece of rock&lt;br&gt;Drown it in ale to make it talk&lt;br&gt;Enchant it with dust and see it birth&lt;br&gt;The rock rune&apos;s powers from the earth
*She leans back from you and glares.*
You are not a bastard! Not a bastard all all!
A note referring to a mysterious &apos;he&apos; lays an unknown accusation at Lucian&apos;s door.
Let&apos;s hope it pays off.
Strange Gem
Poison erupts from the caster in a circular wave, dealing [1] and forming poison clouds. Gives immunity to poison and earth damage for one turn.
O pure Divine, who fills the seas and blesses the soil: welcome us into your embrace. Lead us into the freeing fog, and see us home to the Hall...
*Apologise and back away.*
*Ask him what he means.*
She&apos;s holding court in the sewers, if you can believe it. Go to my wine cellar, pull out the vintage called &apos;Lulabelle&apos;. It will open the way for you.
MAMA! PAPA! FAMILY!
*Urge her not to take the bait. He&apos;s trying to provoke her.*
The spirit of a thief told us that the Thieves&apos; Guild is somewhere in the sewers.
Here. This is a land of thieves - but coin is nothing.
Tanner
Make trade.
My word, a Dreamer! But she dreams no more, alas.
...to roaring and courts... oh. Sorry, I just get a little excited is all.
Be well, Beast. Good-bye.
