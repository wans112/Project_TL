*Reach for your weapon. This danger needs nipped in the bud.*

Enlightenment Herbmix
*Say that you want to carry on Duna&apos;s legacy now that she has passed.*
Until I can return to the kingdom, I will be at the Kemm estate. Royalty is always welcome there; Paulina would have it no other way.
Hmm. I&apos;ve got it!
*Say this is the culminating moment of your life. You love her.*
I didn&apos;t want my people to have it any more than theirs. Nothing good can come of Deathfog. Nothing.

You&apos;ve come to the wrong place at the wrong time...

Don&apos;t have many more of those up my sleeve...
*Tell her you need a moment first.*
No better time than the present, chief. Tell me what you want to do.
Think I need &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; eyes? Please. Before me lies a banquet of power, the most splendid feast for all my senses!

This shield still thrums with the life of the wood of the Ancestor Tree from which it was carved.

*Reply with &apos;Jerd&apos;.*
Don&apos;t leave. I need your help here.
*Tell her you don&apos;t appreciate her ruse.*

Good. Boss could use some good news.
I suppose we ought to inspect the accommodations...
Well, since ye asked so polite-like: &lt;i&gt;NO.&lt;/i&gt;
That said: If you don&apos;t get your head out your arse and make a decision worth more&apos;n my crusty kerchief, you&apos;ll soon find yourself less one sailor.
*He performs a Divine Order salute.*
Memory fails, does it, prince? But elven memory &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; fails. We know from the flesh of your generals that it was you who whispered the poison in their ears. We know from their flesh that the intention was to eradicate both us and the Ring!
Beast... your hands are strong, your back is broad. But you must tend to yourself; care for yourself as you care for &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;. Rest now...
*Stare at him. Yeah. No. That&apos;s not happening.*
It&apos;s time for our shield to become an axe, Quercus.
I know you wanted to impress me... and that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;adorable&lt;/i&gt;. How about this? I&apos;ll let you know a little secret so you can be more like me.
So you prefer retribution to a reprieve, then? Can you not see the harm you would do to the dwarven people by killing their queen?
You met &apos;er? &apos;ow is she then?
But you know, a contract&apos;s not complete until you hand it in, so I&apos;m not putting my feet up just yet...
*Give him a hard look and ask him not to dredge up the past.*
Character Creation Accept
I know your heart.
I would love to hear how it was for you...
*Sebille is forced to look into Saheila&apos;s murky white eyes. It looks like she&apos;s about to collapse.*
*Roll your eyes and turn to leave.*
*Sadha? Say the name means nothing to you.*
*Tell him you need to know who ordered him to kill Scions.*
(Geraldine, how could things &lt;i&gt;possibly &lt;/i&gt;be worse than they are now?)
Fiddlers&apos; Shiv
The island of Fort Joy,
*The captain sobers and curls her lip at the Voidwoken corpses nearby. She spits a bloody tooth in the direction of the closest one.*
K
I must &lt;i&gt;eat. &lt;/i&gt;You will not stand between me and my own soul.
My word, but you do look exhausted. I bet you could use a touch of... magic.

*Take your leave.*
*Take your leave.*
You&apos;re welcome. Now... do show a little gratitude, won&apos;t you?
[BARBARIAN] *Growl that you trust your gut, and its telling you that he&apos;s got secrets. Dangerous ones.*
Physical Armour Potion
Kill her, then. It&apos;s not worth the risk, not when we&apos;ve come so far.
Hey.
*Ask if there&apos;s anything more that can be done for the wounded.*
Ah, they have returned! Or are these different? They all look the same to me...
Good luck to ya!
*Take your leave.*
I ask again: does a creature like me deserve anything less than death?
Your help resolving that... unpleasantness was appreciated.
If the Covenant be in good faith, O black-winged god, and all the forest tigers shall return... then I shall accept your -
We persuaded Exter to attack the Magisters and the Shriekers.
*Tell her to follow  you.*
There is no such thing as no cost at all.
I have a better idea.
We have learned that the dwarves are smuggling the Source weapons to Arx.
Supple and strong, this well-cared-for bow was clearly the trusted friend of a professional hunter.
Do you understand elemental surface gameplay? Fire and ice, steam clouds and lightning - that sort of thing.
What of it?
*A long, sad sigh reaches you from the depths of the Void itself.*
What are you up to?
We found her here, already imprisoned, cursing the Magisters with hexes vulgar enough to turn even a dwarf&apos;s cheeks red.
*You remember that the statue of Amadia in the Hollow Marshes talked to you. But no words from you can rouse this one to response.*
Stink-y, stink-y!
He put a curse on me, and all of my courtiers, transforming us into the beasts you see before you! He&apos;ll come to his senses, sooner or later. Then he&apos;ll beg me for forgiveness!
Luck wishes!
Well, my friend - it looks like our tale is told.
The Path and the Pilgrimage
*Worriedly ask the child&apos;s name.*
I... I am sworn...
*Whatever it is, you hope it&apos;s better than the last Divine.*
It was Sadha who set events in motion, Red Prince. Her selfish desires - her need to spawn a &lt;i&gt;murder of dragons&lt;/i&gt; - led us to this moment.
Many stand in the way of the coming world. They must be removed... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
The cursed lever needs to be blessed, or we&apos;ll end up like the dead Magisters.
Until the dark went silent. Even those barbarians didn&apos;t dare speak in the presence of the Master.
If you wish to know what they were like, you need only look at yourselves.

*Ask where you&apos;ll find him if you need him.*

That burning... it&apos;s like a bomb in my belly, ready to burst...
*Tell her she&apos;s been through a lot and should try to get some rest.*

Nothing unusual here. Looks like I was wrong about you!
[MYSTIC] *Remark that you sense great pain... the loss of a rich elven life, and afterlife... torn apart and scattered throughout the beams and masts of a warship...*
Drained Wand
By the bishop&apos;s bones, you saw it? Out with it, woman! What happened?
[OUTLAW] *Ask what&apos;s in it for you.*
Ain&apos;t found nothing that lets on what Mordus is up to. Only thing we managed were t&apos;close that door and get us stuck. And if there&apos;s another door out there, never could find it.
*Excuse yourself, you think you took a wrong turn somewhere.*
Set Vampiric Hunger on target character, adding [1]% Life Steal for 2 turns. Life Steal heals you in proportion to the damage you deal to Vitality.
*The dwarf turns to you, a quizzical look in his bright eyes.*
[OUTLAW] *Tell her you&apos;ll consider it... if the price is right.*
I might have been wrong about that bloody tinkerer, but I won&apos;t give up until the real culprit is punished! If you find out anything, tell me at once!
*Tell him flatly that you refuse to be a villain in his name.*
Sadha told us that she is Sworn and pursued by the God King.
The Paladins were fools to rise up against the Magisters. Dallis will surely crush them.

*Wipe the flecks of spittle off and turn away.*
Gah! Another giant speaks, Quercus!
Oh - you found the supplies. The Magisters aren&apos;t as thorough as I presumed.
Look at my face, Godwoken. What do you see?
*He looks you up and down.*
*Grateful, you accept. In an instant you are an elf once more, walking in the world. But your new friend begins to make demands. Small services, then larger, and more often. They cause you pain.*

ARCHIVE
Look, we&apos;re cows who were once people who were enslaved and bewitched by a nasty old... uh... witch. We don&apos;t have much to offer.
Not a chance. Whatever came over me before, it&apos;s over now. I won&apos;t turn on my friends.
Isn&apos;t that your line of business?
Skills From Items
*The Red Prince fondles a satin handkerchief, his face a scowl; his eyes two ember spectres.*
*Tell her you plan to start rebuilding what the Void destroyed.*
Clearly that&apos;s not the case, Godwoken. You didn&apos;t free me on a whim - you &lt;i&gt;want something.&lt;/i&gt;
We helped Tarquin with his search for two ancient artefacts - two parts of a broken sword. Tarquin will now repair the weapon.
