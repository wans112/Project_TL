Orders for Isbeil
A prisoner is loose!
Well yes. But not in the manner to which you may have aspired. Let me... show you out.

Atta kid. Your guy&apos;s free to go. He should be fine. Eventually.
[VILLAIN] *Tease her with the sound of a ringing bell. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding...*

[VILLAIN] *Lean close to his ear, then howl like a wolf.*
*The dwarf now has her head buried in her hands. She whimpers at you... or at &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;...*

Black Ring Defiler
Unassuming Citizen
The lich wants us to tamper with a nearby panel.

*Tell him you&apos;re done - he&apos;s on his own from here.*
[UNDEAD] *Remark that you know what death smells like - you know what &lt;i&gt;rotting &lt;/i&gt;death smells like too. But these fish are something else entirely...*
*Tell him now&apos;s not quite the time.*

The Doctor demanded an audience with Lohse.
Natural causes...? She was a royal fire slug in the prime of her youth! No... you&apos;re hiding something... you did this! An assassin trying to conceal her tracks! DIE!
I thought you&apos;d have a little more fight in you than &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. I barely broke a sweat, darling! Run along now, find somebody nice to kiss it all better...
