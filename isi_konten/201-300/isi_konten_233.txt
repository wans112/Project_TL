*Say you aren&apos;t kidding. You really don&apos;t have it anymore.*
We&apos;re managing well enough. You just stay out of trouble, and your stay in Arx shall, I&apos;m sure, be peaceful and pleasant.
If you take or touch property that isn&apos;t yours, beware of the consequences! Owners will develop a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;negative attitude&lt;/font&gt; towards you, and they will &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;call the guards&lt;/font&gt; or even attack you if you go too far. Different people have different reactions.
[SEBILLE] *Tell the crab you weren&apos;t collared very long. The shackles haven&apos;t been made that can hold you.*
Bless you, poppet. Oh, bless you. And here&apos;s the toy &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; wanted!
&lt;i&gt;Help?&lt;/i&gt; And who exactly do you think you&apos;re helping?
In that case... listen up. You must think me mad to approach a stranger, but this camp is full of cowards and I&apos;m running out of time. Fast. Too fast. Way too fast.
*Ask how she can be sure that Isbeil was working for the God King.*
*Look around you and ask if she&apos;s really flirting with you among a field of corpses.*
*Hesitate. You don&apos;t want to do this.*
*His blade is inching out of its scabbard even as he speaks.*
*Beast tilts his head at the sight of you and continues to hum.*
Do you find a use for that rope, my friend? I am sure it helps ease your burdens.
I went to fetch the ball and did my mess and I didn&apos;t get the ball and I can&apos;t get back into the Master&apos;s room!
*You agree with Ifan. Let him consume Alexandar&apos;s Source.*
Primitive Bow
Control Coffer
Brave lad, waltzing in here now...
Uuugh...
*Wonder why the shrine is located in such a dangerous place.*
The acceptable distance for you to keep from me is at least fifty yards. Or the grave.
But it&apos;s not quite the needle.
The dagger that belonged to Lohar. Looks like he used it plenty, too.
Incredible. Perhaps somewhere there is a ghost old enough to unlock the answers I seek.
*The spirit watches Gareth in sadness as he rummages through the house.*
You will have to weigh their short lives against our eternal suffering when you seize the Divine Source.
I see you are taking things that don&apos;t belong to you. In return, I&apos;m taking your life.
Yous know an empty belly is a maudlin thing.
*Decide that you want someone who can strike from a distance with a bow or crossbow - a Ranger would do.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54] gold)
But do tell me, what did you mean when you said you were jealous of Sadha?&lt;br&gt;
The ship&apos;s mute; we need to free her tongue.
You may not bleed, but they could still end you. End &lt;i&gt;all of us&lt;/i&gt;.
*Your clap on the back knocks his knife askew, cutting a jagged line through the best of the flesh. He looks at you with disgust as he tosses the fish aside.*
No more silence. We all speak in our true voices now. So go. I think you&apos;ll sing.
*Ask how much he&apos;d be willing to pay. You are, after all, a kin, and equally adept at lovemaking as he.*
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;I followed my orders&apos;&lt;/i&gt; is a pathetic excuse for her behaviour. Take her Source for yourself.*
Sheer Heart Attack
But &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; his son. I could be trusted to the end. I took every action necessary, for the good of all... unto &lt;i&gt;death!&lt;/i&gt;
*Scoff and tell him to define &apos;wonderful&apos;.*
UI Module Menu Move Add-on Up
Enough! You have irked the mother of dragons one too many times!
One marked for greatness.
Antique Ring
*Change the subject; ask if there&apos;s any way you could help Slane to be truly free.*
*Tell him your blood is boiling. You&apos;ve got to release all this aggression!*
Aye! Centuries gone, but I know a bait fish by the look of one.
Automaton Volter
Lucian&apos;s blessings to you. Lucian&apos;s blessings to &lt;i&gt;all.&lt;/i&gt;
March for Lucian, flicker-imps. He will guide us there, to the star-Hall. The fog can carry you.
Kill... him...
*Tell her not to be hasty: the tinkerer has a bomb.*
Thank you, Bahara, for leading our sun through the darkness. Welcome be, Red Prince, to the haven in the horror.
Mouse X1
Charisma
Bleed Fire
I offer this sacrifice to you. Return me to your side. Make me whole!
If you don&apos;t have what I need, I&apos;ve no more need to talk with you.
*Say that you didn&apos;t even mention Higba - curious that she mentioned him herself...*
*Tell her a hand shake will do you just fine.*
White Fabric Dye
Welcome to Arx, and a very happy Lucian&apos;s Day to you. Don&apos;t let the Voidwoken worry you, we have the situation well in hand. Mostly.
*Her cat&apos;s eyes close as she bends forward to hug you.*
Clear
Far be it from me to raise a hand to &apos;em without a good reason.
A riddle from the past. Or maybe a riddle &lt;i&gt;about &lt;/i&gt;the past?
He&apos;ll be so glad to have his puppy back, even if she&apos;ll have lost some of her lustre...
Poisoned Pumpkin
This very moment, Your Majesty; this very meeting is designed entirely to make up for my failure.
Money goes out, contraband comes in. And it&apos;s Zaleskar&apos;s who&apos;s doing the moving.
*Savour the moment and take your time to look over the statue.*
If you tend to lose sight of characters in combat, visit the Options menu and activate the character outlines.
Roost, he was wickedness come to life. In his mind, we were nothing but things that squeal delightfully when tortured and ravished.
*The dwarf sighs and rolls his eyes.*
In this world you must sink or swim. These people sank.
*Ask about the gargoyle maze. What did it hide?*
This one&apos;s wrecked.
You one of those Braccus soldiers, too? Shoulda been more careful who you went to battle for, bub.
*Tell him you&apos;re not so sure about all this anymore, actually...*
A journal with a note sticking out of it.
After all, I&apos;ve dragons to raise. I need to teach them to be good boys and girls before they set the entire world on fire.
*Wonder how you might bypass the Path of Blood.*
*Note the limp figure&apos;s pristine garb. Is this a Magister?*
My time is meant for sellin&apos; and barterin&apos;, not for wastin&apos;.
*Let his hand hang. Say nothing.*
*Ask how you succeed in the Arena.*
House Interior - Basement B
I&apos;ve had my vengeance. My life and my liberty; you helped me win them back.
*You remove your clothes; she removes hers, and soon you&apos;re in each other&apos;s arms again, naked.*
You saw what I did with Stingtail. You saw it made me feel good.
I&apos;m glad to hear it. It was good to have you on my side. We showed those maniacs what&apos;s what, eh?
*Tarquin&apos;s eyes reach for the skies in a vivid show of annoyance.*
physical
Daeyena. &lt;i&gt;And more.&lt;/i&gt;
Spirit of Gareth
Poisoned Ham
[IFAN] *Mutter that Alexandar won&apos;t be unconscious for long...*
*Bid him pray to his new god.*
Soft Shoes
Even without my guidance you have relearned almost everything you had forgotten. You are ready, my child, and I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have one last thing to teach you...
Madness
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him Sebille is his if he wants her. He may consider her a gesture of goodwill on your part. You&apos;ve much to discuss after all.*
Forged from an ancient metal-like material, this wand is heavier than it appears. Carved along the shaft are dull runes extolling the triumph of the mad Sourcerer King, Braccus Rex. Whatever it used to do, it doesn&apos;t seem to work at the moment.
War Shield
What is it? Why do keep lurkin&apos; around me?
I asked much of you, but I gave you everything you needed to reach your goal. And yet you &lt;i&gt;failed &lt;/i&gt;me.
All
*The young woman blinks as she struggles to focus her vision on you. She looks weak, pale... but already visibly more &lt;i&gt;human.*&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;d have to say my most &lt;i&gt;dritta&lt;/i&gt; music is the sound of a beautiful woman reciting the ballads of Bellegar. Not what you expected, perhaps, but I hear enough singing in my own head!
[BEAST] *Assume a persona: Say your name is Magister... Beard.*
*A gasp escapes your lips and you sense it - her ferocious hunger - as she starts to feed. You feel your Source draining away, your energy sapping, your own hunger becoming unbearable.*
Enter the Portal
*Tell her to calm down. You&apos;ve no intention of hurting her children.*
I will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have my will be questioned any longer! I will protect the Empire, in present and in future. How I do so is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; yours to question.
Small Noxious Salamander
You better not let her hear you say that. She&apos;d kill you with a look alone.
*Roll your eyes and walk away.*
*She reaches out to touch her father&apos;s hand; he withdraws it quickly before remembering himself and reaching out to Yarrow again.*
Server ID
*You feel the unusual object&apos;s vast energy before your hand even touches its smooth surface. Upon contact, the semi-transparent artefact shivers and &lt;i&gt;speaks...*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her that the stew is phenomenal - you have to know her secret.*
My friend died in Driftwood - killed by some foul Sourcerer while doing his duty as a Magister. I&apos;ve come here to pray for his spirit.
*Tell her to stay back. You&apos;re in the middle of something.*
Bah! Most vulgar, most repellent &lt;i&gt;deception&lt;/i&gt; that seeks to bend the will with feeble force.
*Look past the guard and into the shop. So the Queen herself is present?*
We kept the arch-demon&apos;s name from Jahan.
*Ask her what happened back there.*
*An elf sways on her chair, her eyes focused on the counter in front of her, where she has six glasses in a row. With the nails of two fingers, she&apos;s pressing red welts into her forearm.*
Instead of giving Magister Borris what he wanted, I bullied him into submission. He gave me a greasy scrap of paper.
Report back to Hannag.
Chatty, chatty elf. Chatty elf with all the answers. I wonder what your blood tastes like.
*You see the tangled remains of three corpses: a mixed mass of bones and skin from which three skulls protrude. They address you in unison, their voices a drone-like blend.*
Why, the only thing you truly desire. Or certainly the only thing you truly need: I will reveal unto you the location of the Council of Seven.
Red Prince! Greatest of royals! Greatest of kings to be! Do stay with me here for a while. Take a rest from the weary road.
*Reach for your weapon. You don&apos;t take too kindly to her threats.*
*His face twists into a sneer and he flexes his claws.*
Saltwater Crocodile
No. I think you want more.
We can talk of this later. For now, I have but one ambition: to strike down that manipulative &lt;i&gt;witch. &lt;/i&gt;
Look, sister. I can&apos;t say why. But if you know what&apos;s good for you, you&apos;ll get out of Arx. Leave it far behind and never look back.
He... he trusted a stranger over his own daughter?
*Nod. You know what comes next.*
Indeed. Alexandar thinks he is owed his father&apos;s title, yet barely deserves the crumbs of his father&apos;s plate. You can&apos;t let him rise.
*The vines bear unmistakable signs of old elven magic - the likes of which Scions once used to make entire forests spring to life.*
Lohar and his cronies, of course! Ships sail past, see a guiding flame, and sploosh! Wrecked on the rocks, &apos;n&apos; their goodies spillin&apos; out.
Find Sadha.
*Fane grips you by the arm, his hands strong.*
So stand warned, for this is your final warning!
*You&apos;re not giving up your health so it can heal! Refuse the God.*
Drop it.
And that is that.
&lt;i&gt;They &lt;/i&gt;will be most pleased as well. And when they are happy... all of us are happy.
