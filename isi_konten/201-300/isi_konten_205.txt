*Spits.* Away from me, savage. It&apos;s your fault we&apos;re all here in the first place. It&apos;s your fault she&apos;s gone.
Ship Rat
Are you ready for me to join forces?
You have collected the right ingredients to craft your first potion. Combine your ingredients to craft: open your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/font&gt; and press the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Craft&lt;/font&gt; button in the middle to start crafting.
*Suggest she mind her own business.*
*Say she&apos;s right to be wary. No-one present has the right to snuff out a soul.*
Navigate Heroes
Your Source is mine to take!
You just had to get in here, didn&apos;t you? Allow me to introduce Lohar&apos;s welcome party!
Here I still am. And here you still are. Adrift in bloody Driftwood.
Hold up. Shriekers.
Only Sebille knows the truth.
[SOLDIER] *Note that with soldiers like that, the Magisters are a force to be reckoned with. More so than ever.*
You blind the eyes of fate; make them darker than my own.
*Roll your eyes. You don&apos;t have time for this. Take your leave.*
May the Seven bless you. &lt;i&gt;Beast.&lt;/i&gt;
This Game Master Campaign is imported from Steam Workshop. You cannot edit it. Do you want to create a copy?
The one thing I would like you to do for me though, is to return through the mist to the isle of blood, and uncover there &lt;i&gt;his name...&lt;/i&gt;
I can&apos;t... I just... I know he&apos;s important. The details are so... I can hardly see. But... but I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;. I know it&apos;s for the best.
So. What are you waiting for? Bring me back.

Bone Walker
Favourable Wind
*Tell him you&apos;re sensing some resistance. Lohar won&apos;t be happy to hear that. Tell him he needs to point you to the basement and he needs to do it now.*
Flaming Two Handed Mace
Captain&apos;s Backstabber
Lock Inventory
[BARBARIAN] *Eye the creature. If this is a trap, his own bone dust will soon be clouding this catacomb.*
&lt;i&gt;And because you alone witness, I do you this honour - you will be the first to feed the harvest.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you&apos;ve awoken the ship, but haven&apos;t decided how to proceed yet.*
With you around, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll take the risk. I&apos;ll have to face herself in all her wrath. Better get fishing. A bit o&apos; gold for dinner at the tavern might soften the blow. Biddin&apos; you good day then.
I&apos;m gonna give you one more chance to shut that ugly mouth of yours.
You let us know if you meet her. Tell her we miss her. Tell her we&apos;re alright.
Nor I. You&apos;re not half bad. For a lizard.
You will not get away with that!
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for something a little more... exciting.*
I -um - er - haha! Our gargantuan friend is easily impressed. Wait until it learns that I&apos;m a knight, a scholar, &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;a wizard capable of saving the world.
*Tell her you were the one who saved Gwydian from the Magisters.*
Magister Atusa&apos;s flesh revealed her intention to liberate someone called Verdas from the Fort.
*Fix him in the eye and tell him negotiations are over.*
*Lie and say that reliable sources told you the Godwoken contract is cancelled.*
Better stranded out here than stuck in a city with a Voidwoken, I suppose... but they deserved better than this.
Paladin de Blanchefort
There is nothing I know better than demons, and you&apos;ve long since moved beyond the stage of mere possession. Your soul is still yours only because it is Godwoken. In dealing with you I risk... everything.
Let&apos;s see what I can find.
Small Rock Rune
&apos;A-my-ro&apos;. *Ahem* Bloody elves.
Summoning skills let you call temporary allies in battle and buff them.
Sorry you&apos;re upset, sir. But we all wear what we wear for a reason.
It&apos;s the corpses, darling. Blood roses only grow in soil rich with corpses.
Mhordkan
*The spirit&apos;s voice is a harsh whisper. It gusts into you and around you like the winter wind.*
One of your party members is low on health. Use a healing &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;potion&lt;/font&gt; or a healing &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;spell&lt;/font&gt; to help them, or experiment with food and drink.
Greet the reaper for me.
Change applied: unpause to see result.
The Empress! It was her, it was that armour. I died for it, and now I&apos;m trapped here! I...died. Oh, Amadia.
explodable
*She tries to deflect as you tear at her Source... but she is powerless and weak, and cannot resist. She is yours. And then she is gone.*
Burning
*He gives you a strange look. Then turns away.*
Another visit? Jimmy, &lt;i&gt;Jimmy&lt;/i&gt;, wake up!
Despite Gawin&apos;s &apos;help,&apos; we made it one step closer to what might be another escape route.
Raise a walking pile of bones which can consume corpses to restore Vitality and receive a stacking Damage buff.
*The dragon stares you down with flinty, intelligent eyes. He tries to speak, but his jaw is bound tightly by the same thick chains that shackle him to the pillars.*
Come now, be reasonable. This is it: the moment of prophecy and dragons! There is simply no way that you&apos;d risk our friendship by driving a wedge between me and Sadha at this juncture, even though you did so before.
*Tell him the captain has already put you to work.*
I know what you are, friend. You need hope and fellowship. I&apos;ll mark a place on your map where you can find both.
Weapon Range
[MYSTIC] *Note you&apos;ve heard of the demon that inhabited her - yet you sense no overwhelming evil.*
Persisting
...
Ah. There. That&apos;s a bit more familiar.
Godwoken! Riding on the coattails of another, I see? No matter, you too can complete the ritual. Then you will be able to irritate the dead all by yourself. Won&apos;t that be lovely?
*Get in her face. You have a hard time believing she didn&apos;t know &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what she was doing.*
Select the intended Steam profile.
Any means, yes... That&apos;s what I was afraid of.
&lt;i&gt;Woof!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you&apos;re glad: he&apos;s better than that.*
Your assumption is... delightfully naive. Even in the flesh I never did &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; by a lady. I did other &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; entirely, and I&apos;m going to show you what they were!
Jasmine
Let me try something.
Character&apos;s movement speed is increased.
How could I have gone this long without you?
Void-Tainted Crimson Bream
Calvert Webb
*Point to the Black Ring corpses. His handiwork?*
*Deep inside, within you but apart from you, a feeling of great satisfaction wells.*
Intruder
Shadowed Tomb Door
Oh, you! Amadia has a lot of prayers to answer. She&apos;ll get to mine. I think!
*Say you&apos;ve fallen in with a travel mate, but they don&apos;t mean much to you.*
Your teachings served me well, Sir.
The hens were unhappy to hear that their last untainted egg was destroyed.
No. Of course &lt;i&gt;one like you&lt;/i&gt; is never thirsty for wine, nor for water. But for Source?
*Wait for Isbeil&apos;s next example. You enjoy hearing of your own exploits.*
Well, well, well. You&apos;ve got spirit to go with those smarts.
Resistances
Lad, you rarely lead me wrong. Call it. I know you got my back.
Hmm - is that so? Perhaps she thought to convince the keeper, Lord Arhu, to allow her entry. A foolish plan, for more reasons than I can list. I wonder...
I think I might love you...
There&apos;s someone teleporting away from people mid-conversation. I don&apos;t like it - they&apos;re up to something, I&apos;m sure of it. Keep an eye out for them.
Right. Good.
Attack_Skill_Cast_4
*Ask about controlling the ship. What does she suggest?*
*Before you go, tell him that he should probably know you&apos;re actually an undead.*
Fine, I&apos;m convinced. But this better not be a trick.
So you managed to swim to safety, is that it? What about when you were in the water? Didn&apos;t... hear anything... unusual, did you?
Be vigilant.
And... and I see you brought the leaf!
Lohar will want them back.
A prisoner, yes. But my master&apos;s secrets are safe - the vile elf cannot speak our elegant tongue, and he could not break open her chest.
*Tell her that running will not end her torment, but she might very well spread that torment to others.*
Circle of Suns
You know me. You know who I am.
I know you get it, because you get &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;m really grateful to have you at my side.
I... I wasn&apos;t expecting &lt;i&gt;this.&lt;/i&gt;
*Point to one of the pillows and say that it pictures Visha, the famed hero and lover.*
Oh, yes. Hmmm. Of course. Prince of princes, yes. Indubitably. I need to parley with you further, sire. I do and do indeed.
*Growl...* &lt;i&gt;Y&apos;can&apos;t have it. &apos;s ours.&lt;/i&gt;
*Your body convulses with Duna&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile widens at the sight of your agony.*
*The cook acknowledges you with a small bow - an oddly formal gesture given the surroundings.*
The rib-cage of this rotting torso chitters with horrendous echoes of the Void.
*Tell him your crew has proven loyal. You wouldn&apos;t want to betray them.*
Workin&apos; on it... workin&apos; on it... I met Jahan, but I still have a little something to do before he&apos;ll be able to help me.
I stand corrected. You&apos;re not lost at all. You&apos;re here for a definite purpose indeed...
You... you released me, dwarf... long have I waited for this moment...
Light Belt
*Tell him his captain is dead.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell her you appreciate her work takes her to the edge, but she shouldn&apos;t take that edge to the neck of townsfolk.*
It was Ifan who delivered the Deathfog that annihilated the elves.
One end, so many means. Deathfog may as well be one of them.
*Touch your scar. He&apos;s still dancing around the reason you&apos;ve come all this way.*
*Say that you need information about the ship - if the prisoner shows any sign of being willing to talk, you want to know right away.*
*Slip the jar into your backpack.*
So many Seekers lost... and more blood will be spilled before long... at least Han is safe at the shelter...
Very well. My thanks again, child.
Children&apos;s Gloves
Wounded Warg
*Say that if he chooses to harm her, you won&apos;t stand by and watch.*
You mentioned you were once part of the Divine Order. What was that like?
Primordial Fire
This well-cared-for tome features an image of an amulet pressed into its cover, with radiant lines drawn outward to all corners of the book.
The worksmanship on these supple leather trousers is particularly fastidious - every stitch perfectly spaced, every edge carefully reinforced.
Why, I never! I left my good pearls at home or I&apos;d be clutching them with all my daintiest, most lady-like might!
*Ask if she takes any comfort from the Bishop&apos;s presence here.*
*Use your will to hold him off. Ask him what he&apos;s looking for.*
Sadha. The promise of dragons. I value them more highly now even than divinity.
You win some you lose some. Though truth be told, you&apos;re the first opponent ever to acquaint me with defeat.
*No, you say. He&apos;s a good waiter, he waits politely for a break in the conversation to ask them for their orders.*
*Say some might have survived...*
*Leaving? Ask her why she would do such a thing.*
Rest, now, or you&apos;ll hie yourself to the grave!
Don&apos;t bore me with such insipid questions. Not now. Not when the fate of all the realm is at our fingertips.
You mustn&apos;t be so sensitive. I was speaking merely of Ghonghi, was I not? Goodness, me.
*The truth of your final answer momentarily calms you, but it is not enough to ease the inner pain ripping through your mind, soul, and body. The pressure builds... and builds...*
I clean the gods away. I clean you out.
