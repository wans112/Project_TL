[FANE] *Without a word, in absolute privacy, allow the ache of her pain to fill your bones. The Eternals are gone. You have both lost your people...*

Do you take me for a fool? You&apos;re under arrest!
*Cross your arms and tap your boot until this drama passes.*
*Assure him you&apos;re on your way back up. Your ascension to the throne is but a matter of time.*
Go on and scoot then, honey!
Looks I&apos;ll need to have a word with the Doctor. Right after you&apos;ve gone. Which should be any moment now, I&apos;m sure.
*Ask what he wants from you.*
Still, you look as guilty as a wolf in a henhouse. Say something for yourself!
*He blows a dusting of wood dust off the bow.*
*Insist. How much would she be willing to pay?*
She wasn&apos;t the tree but became the tree and it&apos;s not the tree no longer. And still she screams...
*Ask him to be your special advisor - your right hand man!*
*Reach for your weapon. You won&apos;t let her do this.*
Corpses... does every corner of this place hide grim secrets?
Already pickpocketed
*She returns your silence with some of her own, then lowers her head, her spirit broken.*
Strange Device
*He holds up his hand before you can interrupt.*

*Correct him - he keeps using the present tense when he should be using the past.*
*Look at him incredulously. He made you go through this demeaning exercise... for show?*
My legssssssss can&apos;t go any faster...
*The spirit looks around forlornly, seemingly at a loss for what to do.*
*Wendy cries out something to you. You tell yourself it was &apos;I love you&apos;, or &apos;We&apos;ll wait for you&apos;... but the truth is, you didn&apos;t catch it. The farm recedes from view behind you.*
Only everything, sister. Only everything.

There you are! Let&apos;s go, let&apos;s &lt;i&gt;go!&lt;/i&gt;
But of course that must be why you stand before me... Slane called to the Lord of Death, and here &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are. A coincidence?
[HUMAN] *The history of Rivellon is the history of the Divine Order. Talk about Lucian the Divine and his son Alexandar.*
If&apos;n I want somethin&apos; I&apos;ll let you know.
Yes! Yes, exactly! Do you know what to do!?
*He gives you an apologetic look, then turns away.*
Keep moving, Beast. Just keep moving. Gods, what a day.
Caused quite the stir. Queen wanted me gone, but little cousin Justinia - she had my back. Told Queen Lora it was all her idea, and she got a whoopin&apos; on her backside and sent to bed without supper.
Eeeeep! Eeep eep eeeeeep!
If only I could go back in time... I&apos;d leave this place with Farro, and never look back...
What a twist!
*Ask him where you are.*
The cruel joke of it all is that the same tomb that housed my tortured body is what sheltered me from the Void. Few Eternals escaped that fate. Myself... my mother... and...
Hurry up and leave!
*Insist you are telling the truth. What he does with the information is up to him.*
Hey. &lt;i&gt;Hey.&lt;/i&gt;
Ah. Planning an ambush with this Scion, were you?
*Claim that the island is unstable - you have to investigate what lies beneath the mountain before the whole place collapses - it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;urgent.*&lt;/i&gt;
Turn away.
You bear the Divine&apos;s holy gift!
Magister Wand
*With a horrific rasp of bone scraping against bone, he bows low before you.*
B... b... BACAW!!!!
*Bid him goodbye.*
If prices keep goin&apos; like this we&apos;ll be starvin&apos; by the end of the month.
You should probably go.
Magister Clenhe Ra
*She turns and looks you in the eye. Then she dips her head in thanks... and leaves.*
A traitor cannot be murdered. A traitor can only receive their due.
*Dallis groans at the Doctor&apos;s appearance as he calmly raises his palm.*
*Tell him you will see Eleanessa to freedom. He can now enter the Hall without worry or remorse.*
This is Dallis&apos; ship, but she can&apos;t have been the only one who could get it moving. It&apos;d be too risky - and Dallis is anything but careless.
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for a way out; does he know of anything?*

*Your blood is up. Ask her if she wants to... go again.*
Yeah. You can&apos;t have it.
My child. My servant. The stakes are so very high. The princess must not break her bargain with her master. Doing so risks &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; we hold dear. &lt;b&gt;KILL HER.&lt;/b&gt;
Now it&apos;s our holy duty to safeguard him until he becomes the next Divine. And that means putting these Black Ring devils to the sword.
[DWARF-FRIEND] *Say you&apos;d take it as a courtesy from one you regard as a friend.*
*Say you only heard that there was trouble out this way. Maybe he can fill you in on the details.*
You are the new Mother, Sebille. You are the tree of the world. You are... deliverance.
*Leave it to its lamentations.*
I&apos;ll keep looking for my pouch, then. Good day to you!
*Wonder why you&apos;d go to any trouble for the elves.*
Sir.
Stompers
*Justinia turns to Isbeil, looking for answers, or comfort - and Isbeil begins to chuckle. Her laugh is low and measured at first, but grows in magnitude until she can barely breathe.*
Isbeil pressed Queen Justinia to unleash the Deathfog on Arx.
Of course the ends &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; justify the means.
We opened the encrypted hatch. Now to find out what it conceals.
Finally reunited. A happy outcome. Of sorts.
*Do as she says: turn and go. There is still much to be done.*

*Ask him if he&apos;s surprised. It&apos;s never been any other way, really.*
That&apos;s right, Lohse. And don&apos;t forget it. The gods are no better than me. They&apos;re no better than you, either.

&lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Civil Abilities&lt;/font&gt; are non-combat abilities. They come in handy when you are &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;not&lt;/font&gt; solving a situation through conflict.
To be frank, it exasperates.
I know you. I know your light. I kill your light.
Have you a reason for barging into my room, madam?
Welcome to Fort Joy, brother. Comin&apos; from our lands, are ye? Or were ye already set up in Divine Order-ville?
&lt;i&gt;Keep my voice down? &lt;/i&gt;When one of the greatest artists of our time stands before me?

*But as oblivion beckons she changes her mind - she reaches out and desperately clings onto existence - *
*Say the system seems crystal clear; you understand everything that happens in battle.*
I&apos;m merely catering to our sensibilities. A stew of animal meats would be an assault on our senses, enough to turn the stomach.
But I&apos;m willing to bet these Voidwoken will die harder.

We&apos;ve all done things to feed upon Source... what right do we have to judge them?
*Tell her you&apos;re not sure. You met one of the gods again, and they seemed... desperate.*
Would that I could aim this wand at Alexandar myself. To bleach his soul and sear his skin...
I really didn&apos;t want to hang around there longer than I had to. But it&apos;ll be fine... right?
*She says nothing for a moment, but chews her lip, deep in thought.*
Some changes will not take effect until the game is restarted.&lt;br&gt;

Permit me to mark it on your map. Do not tarry, he urgently desires to speak with the great Red Prince.
You&apos;re Godwoken, aren&apos;t you? You tell me.

Well, let&apos;s get back to it then.
Well yeah. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; not the next god. Someone made that abundantly clear...
*She looks on as you remove your garb, and it&apos;s like you can feel her gaze: an eager flame that travels up and down your naked body.*
This is a private affair, and you&apos;re not invited, if ya get my drift.
Fort Joy ain&apos;t no summer camp. *Hack!* No-one said it were. But it&apos;s the best we got to protect the realm.
Find Emmie.

Bronze Scale Pants
Tell me, then: What&apos;s your price?
My amulet is already brimming with Source - it cannot contain more.
The Essence of Existence, Volume One&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some that seek pain, believing that only in suffering can we come close to the Gods. The elves wallow in the deepest of wounds, reliving the pain of wars long past in the belief that they can avoid wrongdoings yet to come. Yet history proves that we are destined to repeat the same errors. What good is a lesson learned if we choose to ignore it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True meaning is not found in pain. Instead, the Gods demand we end life&apos;s tumult in the pursuit of pleasure - pleasure of the mind, the body, and the soul.
