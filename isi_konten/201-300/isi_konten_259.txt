*Taking your time, you carefully enter the combination. The metallic sounds of the tumblers falling within the mechanism let you know you entered the code correctly.*
Seriously, this oughta be good! Yer only gettin&apos; the one shot, so keep yer eye on the prize. Who&apos;s comin&apos; with ya?
Careful not to bite off more than you can chew!
Yeah! You know what? You&apos;re right! What&apos;d they ever do for me, anyway?
Aw. Oh well! Bye then!
You&apos;re back! Good to see you again.
[IFAN] *Say you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; know - and you &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; there. Leave her to suffer.*
Shoot a volatile bolt that deals [1] of a random type, and then creates a corresponding surface.
I met someone claiming to be a god. They gave me a gift. A great gift.
*A saltwater crocodile looks around, seemingly disoriented. It utters an uneven growl.*
Someone always seems to be hurt. Please, I hope you aren&apos;t hurting people!
[OUTLAW] *Tell the door you&apos;re the locksmith, here to replace the... oh, how &lt;i&gt;awkward.*&lt;/i&gt;
The four heroes rose from their graves to attack us. They knew we were Godwoken, and claimed that &apos;the Covenant&apos; would be fulfilled.
I&apos;ll have you know that threatening one&apos;s Master is punishable by death! You&apos;ll never attain the rank of slave with manners such as &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.
*Point towards the forest. Tell them you saw a cat. You&apos;ll mind the gem &apos;til they get back.*
Inimitable Amulet
*The Deathfog stream has become a veritable geyser. The machine is going to blow!*
There&apos;s a mine ahead! Trigger mines by &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;attacking&lt;/font&gt; them with a ranged weapon or by &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;dropping&lt;/font&gt; something heavy on them.
Whisperwood
This richly-designed warhammer is of Dwarven origin. From the quantity of dried blood upon the handle, it appears to have seen more than one battle in the none-too-distant past.
The Seeker asked me the same question, and I fear you&apos;ll fare no better than he. But on your head be it.
*Lie and say you don&apos;t hear voices anymore.*
Report back to Arhu.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Hounds! Take them down!
Soon I see them again. I see them on the other side. Soon. Soon.
Beach - Shore
Legends say this ancient weapon could even defeat the mighty Braccus Rex.
Ryker,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contract is mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will pay you an execution fee of 25% if you take out any of my marks, but do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; presume to go over my head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roost

*He raises an eyebrow and folds his arms, appraising you.*
*A lizard in heavy ritual garb stands before you, awaiting your attention.*
Vegetable Stew
on any controller to begin turn
*The statue rotates with little resistance.*
Doors
Fatal Blade
This modification will be baked into your saved game. You won&apos;t be able to disable it later. Are you sure you want to enable it?
You dare interrupt Braccus Rex?! How... novel. &lt;b&gt;WHO ARE YOU TO CHALLENGE THE SOURCE KING?!&lt;/b&gt;
He say he likes it big &apos;n&apos; strong...
Wind-up Toy Skillbook
*You start to slowly creep forward. Your hand touches the floor. It&apos;s slick with something.*
*Smile and tell her... someone told you the same thing.*
Trader
*Leave him to his vengeance.*
So true! And you can stay as long as your heart desires, free of charge.
We paid Grog&apos;s toll, but it didn&apos;t improve his temperament.
But I&apos;ve reached the end of my tinkering abilities. N-n-not my fault, but only the original creator could fix it now. And &lt;i&gt;she&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;be along any day now.
Do you know, lover, I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;want to go again. Come here!
You&apos;ve yet to experience the joy and pain of true combat, I see.
We couldn&apos;t be together here. They wouldn&apos;t allow it, remember?
Right you are. Right you are.
*Remark on the rather unique-looking painting. Don&apos;t mention that it&apos;s the Second Passion of Lucian.*
You! Baddie? Buddy! Buddy? Buddy! Erm... BADDIE!
We remain. Our ritual is not complete. Sarias is not home. We remain.
*Tell him to explain. You haven&apos;t agreed to be anyone&apos;s champion.*
Almira&apos;s Hideout
You have, have you? Then you&apos;ll mourn his loss, like t&apos;rest of us.
*If it&apos;s looking for an answer, ask what the question is.*
We&apos;re aboard the Merryweather, on our way to the Sourcerer colony of Fort Joy. We are told there is a murderer on board with us.
BYE-BYE!
*Ask about the gauntlet he&apos;s wearing - is it Magister-forged?*
Your local files are newer than your Steam files. Do you want to upload them to Steam? Otherwise, your Steam files will be downloaded.
I was dying anyway. The Magisters&apos; purging made certain of that. I should probably send the Void a thank you bouquet. At least they were efficient about it.
I can&apos;t hear this ship&apos;s voice. It should sound like a song... or maybe a cry. There&apos;s got to be a way to speak to her.
*The spirit of a Black Ring reaver looks down at his corpse in dismay. He notices you approach, and challenges you in a throaty rasp.*
*Shrug.* I dunno. The Deathfog covered the forest an&apos; everybody died, dint even have the time ta scream. If a tree falls then, I don&apos;t care if anyone heard it happen, I wanna know if anyone &lt;i&gt;cares.&lt;/i&gt;
*The egg is warm to the touch... but not from the ashes. This warmth comes from &lt;i&gt;deep within &lt;/i&gt;the egg.*
Indeed not, Your Majesty. But you live still, and by your own devices. A formidable feat, that much I assure you.
Bishop Alexandar
We&apos;re playing with fire... and we better make sure we have a way to put out the flames.
Damage is based on your level and receives bonus from [1].
*Look around the gore-streaked room. You&apos;re not sure, but it&apos;s his call.*
I&apos;ve tasted better brews, but from the look of you, the refreshments won&apos;t be improving.
I wish I could feel it. Just once, before our God King raises the faithful to immortality. Before the chance is gone forever...
Alright, alright. Be on your way, then, but know I&apos;ve got my eye on you.
*Wonder why it would have her name inscribed on it.*
*Laugh along with him. What a song! He almost had you dancing.*
Gauntlets
&lt;i&gt;The Voidwoken. Disgusting things. They ravaged the land they touched and infected the air they breathed. They were also an &lt;/i&gt;incredible&lt;i&gt; stroke of luck.&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, dear Prince. You are much too concerned with how I speak - and not concerned enough with &lt;i&gt;what I know.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask what makes her think you&apos;re so special.*
- PECKER?
But whatever you do, hurry it up. The longer we sit here, the higher the chance the Order will get their hands on you.
*Ask him why. Why have they been hunting your kind?*
[VILLAIN] *Kill her. Obviously.*
*Tell him his form of justice is simply revenge. He brings shame to the Seekers.*
*Nod. Time is short - let&apos;s go!*
As it so happens, I do... &apos;afraid I wasn&apos;t able to take advantage of it myself though...
*Gareth grasps your shoulder as you turn to go.*
Melee attacks deal additional fire damage to burning targets, poison damage to poisoned targets and physical damage to bleeding targets.
*Isbeil turns the valve - but no fog wafts forth. In that moment, you feel your marrow awaken. You&apos;ve regained control of your own bones at last.*
Ralvo
Learn skill
*The spirit&apos;s stern demeanour melts into a look of panic as you banish her to nothingness.*
*Bittersweet. It&apos;s the only word that comes to mind when you try to interpret Jonathan&apos;s expression, ghostly as it is. He looks both impressed and indignant, nostalgic and enraged.*
Range: [1]
May the goddess&apos; rays fall upon thy person and thy house, kinsman. Blessed be your devotion.
Blank Air Scroll
I don&apos;t know. Maybe the Paladins have finally had enough of this clampdown. The Magisters&apos;ll just go and lock up anybody. That wasn&apos;t Lucian&apos;s way. Was it?
*Two tight-bound masses of hair and fang amble away in search of food.*
*Say farewell. You have much to attend to.*
Hatch
Now where was I? Ah, yes! The succubus.
Assign point
And I thought that smell was the sea...
Quercus! Quercus! Do you think they recognised us?
Unlocks [1]
Very good.
He&apos;s gone? You&apos;re absolutely, &lt;i&gt;positively &lt;/i&gt;sure...?! That means... that means I&apos;m free! I can take suitors, find myself a real prince, not like that scoundrel Braccus!
My dear, sweet love. Thank you for being here. For the end.
*His soul is yours. Consume his Source.*
*Ask who&apos;s drowning.*
*Put your arm around him. He should consider you a friend. And friends tell friends the truth, do they not?*
Vydia&apos;s Chest
*Lie and claim to be travelling with friends.*
*Spin it counterclockwise.*
[IFAN] *Tell the Magisters that it looks like they need some professional help.*
Fight Theme Tambura
One foe the fewer to worry about. But there remain the Shriekers. Our day is not done yet.
*The black ink turns blood-red as it touches the parchment. A burst of energy shoots out from the desk and shocks you.*
*Say: &apos;My self-respect&apos;.*
*Say you&apos;re still getting the lay of the land.*
[DWARF] *Confidently proclaim that dwarves make the best lovers.*
*Smile and say you&apos;ve faced plenty of danger in your time - a kitchen doesn&apos;t hold any terrors for you. Why is she so keen for you to leave?*
The God King has birthed a new son. I don&apos;t fight the comin&apos; storm. I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; the comin&apos; storm. An&apos; you won&apos;t be escapin&apos; it, old friend.
Lucian said, &lt;i&gt;&apos;Only fools despise discipline&apos;.&lt;/i&gt; We wait until the Shriekers are purged. It&apos;s not up for debate.
We found the book from which the pages were torn. It’s called ‘Dwarven Customs &amp; Traditions’.
*Tell him that he should leave then, and join up with whatever this venture is.*
Stoneskin Potion
*Fix her with a stare and insist &lt;i&gt;most forcefully&lt;/i&gt; that you need to pass.*
You. You interfere? &lt;i&gt;What do you do?&lt;/i&gt;
All that you have left to give.
Relic of the Eternals
*The Magister cocks his head, seemingly surprised at what he heard.*
Sebille! You return. There is much to talk about but first, the Mother needs you! She is in danger. A shadow hunts her. You must rid us of the shadow. Use your special talents.
Will you sing?
*Smile and take your leave.*
The Divine Order have a Lone Wolf contract out on the Godwoken.
*Take a moment to appreciate the clean air and sunshine. Tell him it&apos;s a fine day, indeed.*
It&apos;s a good thing I&apos;m in a generous mood. Fine, then. But next time, I&apos;m not so forgiving.
Get an eyeful. I expect it&apos;s the last we&apos;ll see of each other for some time.
But - learned a trick since last we met, have I.
Distinctive Boletus
Each lever is named for a virtue of the Divine. Find the levers whose initials spell the word &apos;power&apos;. Select these five, and these alone.
Well, how fortunate. You may be of use.
*Say that you found some of his remains.*
Think, damn it... where would a Magister hide something?
The Dreamer asked us to enter the Devourer&apos;s dream and face the dragon there. Once he is dead, the spirits bound to the armour will be free.
We&apos;ve gotta stay alive, ain&apos;t we? I aim to survive as long as I can in this hellhole.
*Offer him a handful of coins to change his mind.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_4_5dac5eea-faeb-459c-b675-46c51519b784])
So what? Do you want me to give you a medal now?
Figurehead of the Lady Vengeance
I blame Alexandar for this.
To the Lower Vault
*Note her pallor and ask if she needs help.*
*Tell him &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;thinking he should shut up and get naked.*
I wish I could think like that. All I can picture is us, alone, unprotected... and the Void so close...
Cross
*You see an undead figure chained to a torture rack, bones glowing a sickly green as if lit from within. It raises its head to look at you before lowering it again, exhausted from the effort.*
