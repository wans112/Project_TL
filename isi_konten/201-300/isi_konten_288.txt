The Mother Tree was destroyed by Deathfog. It&apos;s over.
Oh no. You had your chance, darling.
Countryside Indoors 02
Hanal Lechet
*The spirit raises his head and holds his palms upwards.*
They fed me... horrible things. Meat. From... from people. I didn&apos;t want to eat it! But they do something to it that makes it... irresistible. Even you, the one who saved me... I can picture sinking my teeth into you, ripping the flesh apart, swallowing it down...
*Say you cannot accept. Her cruelty is all too pronounced.*
Wait! Do you mean to abandon the egg, to abandon the prophecy? Once you depart, there is no returning!
You&apos;re not welcome here!
*Braccus&apos; spiky scribbles tied fire runes to the cult of the dragon. This altar would require a fire rune.*
Exhausted
*He looks around, surveying your surroundings with a keen eye.*
It begins within. You use but a fraction of your tremendous power, but you must unlock the rest. And then...
*Ever-tightening cursed branches constrict the great dwarven god Duna. His eyelids flutter and his face, bluish and bloated, nods.*
Bah! Of course you are. Here I sit, a paying customer with a purse full of coin, and I can&apos;t even get my hands on a little something warm in my belly!
It was hard to see her die. It was harder to know what she did while she was alive. Still...
*Her only reply is a smile as radiant as a thousand suns. Her lips part as if to speak, but the words that reach you seem to echo from a celestial distance.*
Where were you when we needed you, hero? The Voidwoken are dead, and half the guests with &apos;em. You should be on your way.
Let&apos;s... let&apos;s go!
I fear for these souls if he has come to any harm in the marsh. Without the wands he seeks, not one will escape this island.
Food-Splotched Recipe
*Kneel before the Magister and force him to swallow a healing potion.*
My Source was his lifeblood. Now my hunger must be sated. &lt;i&gt;My soul will be mine again.&lt;/i&gt;
[BEAST] *Say that between all the rebelling and swashbuckling, the affairs of gods was the furthest thing from your mind.*
It might be wise to look for a way out of here.
Do not stick your snout into Lord Kemm&apos;s business, lizard! I don&apos;t have to tell you anything.
A Fingal Boyd&apos;s Limited Edition
[IFAN] *Talk about that fateful day: you had been enjoying a puff or two of drudanae when reality went a little... askew. You summoned your wolf Afrit, and the rest was history.*
The selfsame tiger, I suspect, that has been haunting &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; Lohse.
*The second dial has the same four phrases to select from...*
New Folder
We should burn the mixture in the bowl with the cellar&apos;s incinerator, then inhale the smoke.
Now get your glittering bones away from me. Go clack and chatter at someone else.
I mean the rich... warm... &lt;i&gt;red... &lt;/i&gt;smell of raw meat.
Sack of Loot
This part is gated off from the rest... whoever is buried here must have been important...
*Corruption.*
A ssspecial tasssk indeed, for which you shall be rewarded. We shall ssstep assside, for Alexsssander lies beyond, within the temple of the elves. But be warned - Shriekers block the way.
*He responds with a weak shrug.*
They... spoke to you?
Looks like I find a thief, all right. You&apos;re under arrest!
A prince of the House of War remembers his friends, but he remembers his enemies better.
Perhaps one day I&apos;ll get desperate enough to disabuse you of that notion.
Ya just had to have it yer way, didn&apos;t ya? Well, go on down the hatch, then. Ain&apos;t gonna try &apos;n&apos; stop ya.
The Doctor is not taking visitors.
*Boast that you crafted it yourself, using a tool to rip the faces from mortal creatures.*
One of our companions was Sworn to the God King, and betrayed us.
*Ask for a bowl of stew.*
Carson. Don&apos;t yeh worry, now. You may not remember my name, but you&apos;ll remember our capers for sure.
A surprise flash that can inflict blind in a [1] radius. They never see it coming...
Marcus. Marcus Miles.
There might be nothing like this left in the world. Not since Lucian used the Deathfog on the elves.
For your own peace of mind, of course. Yours and the whole world&apos;s.
We returned the Djinn to the lamp.
*A warm hand grips your shoulder, and you turn to see... Tarlene. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Sisters in Lucian, forever. I promise.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; But you don&apos;t believe her.*
We fought in the arena blindfolded.
*Wonder what she expects from the new Divine.*
Hey chief - before we get a move on, I&apos;d like a word with Malady. You mind?
It would be cruel to keep a man&apos;s soul when we could easily free it.
Slumberjack is dead. We won&apos;t be able to learn the location of the hidden loot from her now.
*The guard hurries over, eyes filled with suspicion.*
Area pick up
Live and let live I say.
Oh - *cough* ahem, yes, it- eh - it seems our Shield is still here, Quercus...
I... I...
Lohar became mayor, and Brayton Barnes grew rich, until, after a public argument over import duties, Barnes died in an accident - buried under several tons of fish and also stabbed in the back with a gutting knife.
*Tell him you met with Brahmos in the dream realm. You were supposed to meet him here, in the flesh.*
I... I recognise the face. But I can&apos;t quite place it...

*Say that you fought your way through the Council.*
F24
*Ask what a bunny is doing out here alone in the woods.*
Dogs! Skulking &lt;i&gt;vermin!&lt;/i&gt; COWARDS!
*Express surprise. Does she think Griff is mistaken?*
*Note that Isbeil seems to hold much sway here. Was attacking Arx &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; the queen&apos;s idea?*
And what kind of Divine was Ifan ben-Mezd as the world battled on?
*The bottom drops out from within you. She lifts you up, up, up...*
*Deny knowing anything about Source use.*
The power of Divinity could bring them back - not as monsters, but restored to their former glory.
There! You heard it, didn&apos;t you? I knew it! I &lt;i&gt;knew &lt;/i&gt;it! Aye, this is good news, girl. &lt;i&gt;Good news&lt;/i&gt;.
Even without my guidance you have become a true Master of the Source. You are ready, and I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have something else to teach you...
The third Passion of Lucian. His glorious return.
I warned you not to touch him!
Spirit of Mupper
Contrived from the scum of Rivellon&apos;s vilest troll&apos;s feet, witch&apos;s gums, and demon dung, this poison could take down an average-sized wollock.
Nice day for it, miss... all the nicer after I&apos;ve clapped eyes on you, heh...
The Godwoken themselves became silent monks.
Consume frozen surfaces around you and convert them to Magic Armour. Removes Burning and Necrofire.

We found the dead hero Bromley&apos;s treasure in the Cullwoods.
Levelling Up
*Ask him if he really wants to tangle with someone as formidable as you are. Especially now, when he is so close?*
*Say nothing. Take one last look at her before she leaves.*
*The spirit has now acquired a wound on his shoulder from whomever he&apos;s fighting. Ghostly silver blood trickles down his half-undone tunic.*
...but that was not a good joke. Guards - kill him!
*Frown. That beast was her father?*
*The machine has overloaded, and the barrier is lowered.*
Daeyena
But before we get to the nitty gritty, we need to be perfectly clear about one matter.
sort by ...
Report back to Alexandar.
*Ask her how it feels to be free - once and for all - of all that haunted her.*
Give it to me again...
Now we are trapped here like this, until Braccus relents...
*Shake your head. You do not want to do this.*
*Accept the offer of help.*
That&apos;s not for the likes of you to say! Now keep away - I don&apos;t want these brave Seekers to hear you talking about them like they were lame farm animals!
Orders to deliver a spore to the Blackpits, once held by captive Magister. Use to read.
[1]weapon[2]
*Both Magisters note your dead tone and eye you with fleeting curiosity, yet their attention is clearly distracted.*
Almira died before she could teach us more about our Source powers.
Couch
Necromancer Rask&apos;s Soul Jar
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without learning more about the Deathfog attack.
*It&apos;s dawning on you ever more clearly. Soon your companions will stand in your way.*
*His armour sounds valuable. Ask where he expects to find the remaining pieces.*
*Approach him about the notes you found. The ones in the Sallow Man&apos;s... &lt;i&gt;office.*&lt;/i&gt;
Devourer Armour Research Notes
Similarly, what happened with the Knights of Drey is our own business. Those acorn-worshipping acolytes do not scare me.
*Tell the demon to take you as a host instead.*
What&apos;s the catch.
*And all of a sudden, it&apos;s over. Blackness rises once more, just as it was at the start. Eternal darkness, and you.*
*She looks to you, then quickly looks away.*
I met him once, during a soiree in Arx. Quite the eccentric is Doctor Daeva, but then again...
Proud to serve for the good &apos;a humankind. Without us, Rivellon&apos;s off to the Void in a handbasket. In the crook of a *hack!* Voidwoken&apos;s claw!
Oh hi. Nice to see you. Bye then.
*So he&apos;d give it all up for &lt;i&gt;love.&lt;/i&gt; How unexpectedly weak of him.*
A contract? I see. How could I blame you, under the circumstances?
Run With the Pack
*Summon as much Source from within as you can. Maybe you can break free.*
*Ask how she came to be here.*
*Tell her you know all about her kisses. You want in.*
You are quite safe! I am so glad.
*Say that there&apos;s just one  thing to do then: Find a cure!*
Summon Unstable Bomb
So, what&apos;s next for you? Ready to settle down somewhere, or has the exciting life of an adventurer given you a taste for travel?
*She lowers her eyebrows and blinks twice.*
*Take his hand...*
And now a stern chastisement in three... two...
You&apos;re lucky I have other matters to deal with. Otherwise you wouldn&apos;t get away so lightly with insulting me.
[LOHSE] *Laugh gaily.*
Get out of my head. GET OUT!
Very well! In that case we&apos;ll forego the gallows and turn straight to the hunt: the very definition of your order&apos;s existence.
For how much of this do you take credit... or blame? And what kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
*Say that they called you their saviours.*
Arhu was - is - Lucian&apos;s greatest asset. A great wizard, and clever as a cat. He protects Lucian&apos;s remains deep within the Arx cathedral, and I can think of no-one better suited for it.
*Delorus kneels and rolls over the corpse of a Magister. He takes in his comrade&apos;s lifeless face for a moment, then bows his head.*
*Leave her be.*
I don&apos;t know exactly what it is, but I know it&apos;s called the Aeteran. Supposedly sucks the Source out of anything and anyone... for good! All I ever found were glowing gems and baubles, though.
Ssh, sh sh sh. Don&apos;t you hear her?
Has as many lives as a cat, it seems. Let&apos;s see if he acts like one when cornered.
You just... watched. You never said a word...
