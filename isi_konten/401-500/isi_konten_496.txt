I got nothin&apos; more to say on the subject. So there!
*Call up your Source powers and focus them on the relic.*
*Lead into a song you know about a hero from a lush, green land.*
I am a projection of the spirit of Eleanessa. The demon is dead. I am no longer his slave. You have my gratitude - and in recognition of all that you&apos;ve done, I shall give you... the spirit of an elven morning-star.
Stranger things have happened than Alexandar becoming Divine.
And so he entangled our bodies and cursed our throats. Smote the Brothers of Baladur.
Demonic Flayer Slicer
*She looks up at you. Her eyes flat and cold, their pupils shrunken to tiny points. She lets Roost&apos;s hand slip through her fingers, then catches it by the pinky. She dangles it in front of her eyes.*
*Beast looks not at you, or even through you, but beyond you, beyond the academy, to a place far from you, but close to him.*
I&apos;ve only one Seeker left that can help you...
The House of Shadows, yes I know.
Heavy Hammer
*The Magister visibly pales, before stammering out a response.*
You can &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;barter&lt;/font&gt; with almost all characters. Use the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;trade&lt;/font&gt; icon in the dialogue pane to start bartering.
I&apos;ve got it all, down to the letter! Thank you so much. You don&apos;t know how helpful you&apos;ve been.
*Ask him if he saw what unfolded here.*
Things are so much simpler when everyone is dead.
NO! Don&apos;t touch me! Let me go!
I know they help.

No King shall rise again? What &lt;i&gt;happened &lt;/i&gt;here?
*Cursed tendrils tighten around Zorl-Stissa. Her lips are moving, but no words seem able to escape her lips.*
I asked him about this artefact we had. A spore - he muttered at it in elven, and it bloody &lt;i&gt;burst&lt;/i&gt;.
Who are you? Did Lord Kemm send you about the missing prisoners?
Got a little too close to Mona, did you? Poor dear won&apos;t let me heal her. Lost all hope, I suppose. Whyn&apos;t you let me clear that up for you.
Active Search
I&apos;m Lucian! Gonna kill you, Damian!
*You recall Karia. House of War. She died burning. Sometimes you think you hear her soothing screams on the wind still.*
Level [1]
[SOLDIER] *Say that you could give him some tips instead; you&apos;re a bridge guarding expert.*
*Carefully pick your way in.*
Lady Kemm is having tea in the drawing room over in the north wing. I&apos;m quite certain a person as obviously well-travelled as yourself will have no problem drifting in that general direction should she deem it fit to do so...
*The laugh rises once more, and the girl lifts her head. Her gleeful eyes remain pitch black.*
*Ignore her.*
Ye&apos;re back, I see.
*She turns and waves one timid hand to her husband on the balcony. He offers an apathetic grunt in return. She blinks back tears from her pink-tinged eyes.*
Hold it. Papa no know? You no go.
At least here our Shield&apos;s ignorance can be forgiven, Quercus. The Knights of Drey do not go out of their way to boast about their existence.
There&apos;ll be new taxes to pay for all of this damage, I can smell it on the air... you elves have the right idea - own nothing, and have nothing to be taken away from you.

Vulture&apos;s Prayer
Precious wares, are they not?
This was Hallorn&apos;s blade. It was his first. It was also his last. He didn&apos;t intend to die here, but die here he did. He was an ordinary soul with an extraordinary heart, Hallorn. And he died for what he believed.
*The queen&apos;s seen her errors. Say she deserves a chance to guide the dwarves once more.*
[BEAST] *Say your future is just that - yours.*
Profile:
*The arrow soars long and far, whistling a dusky tune as it flies against the breeze. It hits a rabbit dead-on, fletchings quivering with the impact as the blood runs into the soil. Ifan nods and retrieves the carcass.*
*Smile and ask if it can ransom a god.*
The Divine Order? With Black Ring slaves?
You&apos;ve picked up a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;bedroll&lt;/font&gt;! Use it to rest and heal your party.
*Ask him why he&apos;s locked up.*
*He seems restless. Angry. On the cusp of a tempest you never expected could ruffle his unshakable demeanour.*
They would not trust humans again.
Distilled from a rare and highly addictive herb, this brew sharpens your perception and your aim.
*Agree to her demands.*
We escorted the couple to safety.
Silence! It is not for you to question orders.

I take matters into my own hands.
*Consume the Source from the puppet.*
Not the time to use this, I suppose.
Approaching hostiles will be blasted with fire damage.
This thing... speaks to me. But what is it trying to say?
*Demand to know why her. Why did he do this to Sebille?*
*Ask about this goddess Amadia, who&apos;s changed her life so much.*

*Look her right in the eye as you mumble something unintelligible.*
On my return to Rivellon, the Shadow Prince paid me a visit. Knowing I would not prevent the fulfillment of the prophecy, he tried to kill me.
*Ask if she&apos;s been here a long time.*
Until later, my lovely.
Go! We have wasted enough time here, and he is not a patient creature.
Thanks... for stopping me back there.
Will we stop Dallis from executing her plan?
I &lt;i&gt;cannot &lt;/i&gt;abide a student who isn&apos;t willing to learn - do you want my help or not?
We stood up for the put-upon elf.
We convinced Effie to drug the other fighters.
Come, ascend to the sanctuary of Amadia. You&apos;ll find you&apos;re not the only guest here, but the Great Mother provides for all.

Can&apos;t go there now. Salamanders. They like the meat. I don&apos;t want to be meat.
*Take your leave.*
Broken Source Collar Amulet
*Keep a straight face and insist: you&apos;re right behind her.*
And now only divinity can save what remains. You no longer trust in the Order, Ifan... but you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; trust in &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
The Red Empire was born, and his House remained true to its name:
*Tell it you&apos;re fairly good with an axe. If it wants to keep its vigil over these dead lands, it should help you.*
Grotesque Jar
Truly...? I thought your path through the Council would have crossed with his... no matter. He must be dead now - nobody could survive what happened on that island.
Exciting New Discovery
Fragments of history, some of them possibly dwarven!
Let&apos;s hope this is worth the digging!
I&apos;ll consider that an admission of guilt. Prepare yourself!
*Leave it be.*
You certainly seemed capable in Fort Joy. And a companion on Reaper&apos;s Coast could be quite educational.
*Stare him into oblivion. Marcus is dead.*
&apos;ullo, ugly.
*Be on your way. It is time to take control of the Lady Vengeance.*

The never-ending contest for power continued.
Folded Shirts
Everyone was now a Sourcerer,
*Fold your arms. You have no intention of leaving.*
*Try to move the statue.*
Only a coward would let someone talk about their soul mate like that.
By all means - but if you run into trouble, don&apos;t expect me to stick my neck out to help you.
Face the Master.
*Ask why she&apos;s letting you so close to the crime scene. For all she knows, you could be the killer.*
*The child sticks out her tongue at you and continues playing.*
Everybody out! Troll dinnertime!
An attack that deals [1] damage and sets Bleeding and Fear on all enemies in a small radius.
Milord,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do detest excuses, but I find myself in a difficult position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At every turn the Godwoken have stood in my way. Each time I think it&apos;s finally over, they return anew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As much as you must doubt me, I have begun to doubt even myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please, do not give up on me. Not yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your faithful servant,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Windego
Someone, help me!

We learned the location of the Thieves&apos; Guild: in the sewers, accessed through a hidden door.
Magic Armour
*Ask how she&apos;s so certain you&apos;re capable of what she asks.*
The cows mentioned something about rats. It might be worth looking into.
[SEBILLE] *Noting his vulnerability (as is your wont), ask about the broken rapier.*
That&apos;s it - put &apos;em up, y&apos;half-sized goon!
I must admit, my research never covered &apos;ways to entertain cherished colleagues as they&apos;re pulled into interactive memories of your past.&apos;
Well. That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;escape route scuppered. Time to find another way out. What&apos;s your plan?
My darlings aren&apos;t like that. They are pure and beautiful. They don&apos;t make mistakes, and they don&apos;t question my desires. I don&apos;t need &lt;i&gt;others &lt;/i&gt;anymore. I have something better.
Why, a body of flesh and Source that has opened the door to the world beyond.
Remorse

Vaporise Scroll
Good boy.
You animal! Stay away from my bar, you hear? I can arrange to have that wagging serpent ripped right out of your head!
To take a life so callously. Would they take my own so easily?
&apos;Beat us, break us, green-black sea - we are slaves...&apos;
I&apos;ve given e-e-e-nough for one miserable boat ride. Shoo!
Yes, she is close by indeed. There&apos;s a camp to the north; it&apos;s where I was headed before the House of Shadows caught up with me.
As rat problems go, this one is a doozy.
*Tell him you want to end Justinia&apos;s madness - but not her life.*
Swaggering scaley twit.
When enabled, the hotbar will automatically add new containers to the hotbar when you first pick them up.
And you&apos;re just a corpse-muncher with a pretty face and an obsession with *oink* trees. Now leave my sight, lest I make an unseemly squeal.
Your flesh is weak - all flesh is weak - but your spirit remained strong as your flesh was being pierced. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt;, I admire.
I&apos;s on fire! Hel&apos;! Hel&apos;!
Speak with Mordus.
The Godwoken themselves became silent monks. Dallis cared for their bodies - the empty vessels that had once carried their formidable souls - until they succumbed to the ravages of time. They were buried in the crypt, where Lucian once stole the Source from the Gods, and where the Godwoken made the ultimate sacrifice.
I have travelled with you through good times and bad, but nothing you have done has made me think you are more fitting to wield Divine power than I.
*The ground around you trembles, as if an enormous beast has landed there.*
&lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt; Give!
If the Void breaks through, it is the end of everything we know. I would kill you, your family, and my own sweet, darling grandmama if that&apos;s what it took to keep this world safe.

Divinity is the problem. &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am here to fix that.
I&apos;ve got no use for empty platitudes - not from some whinging wolf chosen as the Seven&apos;s special pet.
