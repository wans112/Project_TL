[SWORN] *Cry out to the God King. &lt;i&gt;You reject his will. You are not his, and neither is she.*&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m not here for show, brisk britches. You got a reason to be here or you got a death wish?
Now then. On a more serious note. Why didn&apos;t you kiss me?
Decaying
and I was finally free.
You&apos;ve done us proud. You... saved the world, didn&apos;t you?
&lt;i&gt;Kwih manduhkad umnio myrdus ects, it kwot potest ezse!&lt;/i&gt;
Not that your story is finished, of course. Draining Source from the wind and waters may have felt charitable, but I promise that gratitude will rarely be showered upon you.
Tired but victorious, the party made for the Lady Vengeance,
You started a new arena lobby. Other local players will be disconnected.
*Amadia doesn&apos;t react this time, but you can feel the cold terror gripping her.*
*Set her mind to rest. Tell her the search goes &lt;i&gt;extremely &lt;/i&gt;well.*
Tsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...
*This notice has a skull on it. That&apos;s generally a bad sign...*
Make yourself invulnerable.
*Lohar&apos;s lips move as he reads through the note. After a moment, his lips go still and his face turns the colour of bone dust.*
She held the Seekers together when we had every reason to fall apart.
There&apos;s something odd about this fireplace...
It burns! It burns! Put it out!
*Reach for your needle. It&apos;s just about time.*
*Ask if it doesn&apos;t mean &apos;rabbit&apos;.*
I&apos;m growing soft, aren&apos;t I...
All you need&apos;s a way across. Ma lifted the bridge, but there&apos;s got to be another way. Right?
Drink
Blessings of the Divine upon you, good sir! My husband and I were just sitting down for a picnic under the sun. We haven&apos;t much to offer, but would you care to join us?
You mistake me for a fool.
Keep on walking, bud.
Adorned with the feathers of Duna&apos;s Undertaker, this coat vibrates with the power of a god. It feels less than weightless, as if eager to take flight.
Skirmishing Axe
And then there are the self-styled heroes like you charging in there, thinking they&apos;re just going to cut down that demonic foliage with a slice or two. Not likely. You heard me, missy: You&apos;re part of the problem!
The elf. He creeps about down there, snatching bodies from crypts. From the earth. From wherever he can nab &apos;em.
I believed you, Dallis, when you told me I was chosen. But all this time, you were lying. You were trying to prevent my ascension. So disappointing. But your games end here. It is time for me to claim my birthright.
*I said I had his Soul Jar. Would he like to make a deal?*
Keep in mind he may not look quite... human. Arhu is a talented shapeshifter, you see. Keep an eye out for a white cat - it might be the Lord Protector himself!
*Say that if he expects you to get him drudanae, he could at least tell you where to look for it.*
You&apos;ve been warned, Barnes. Now get out of my sight.
Track her in Arx; find out where she&apos;s gone and &lt;i&gt;end &lt;/i&gt;her. Take back the Aeteran and the powers of the gods with it.
I stood up for what was right, and I would ask no more of you. I will guide you, but first you must return to the world and escape these swamps.
We mourn for Saheila. We mourn for our Scion.
*Say she&apos;ll never be truly free of the God King as long as he threatens all of Rivellon.*
Bodyguard
Nothing to it, for one not wrapped in chains.
Search for Lord Arhu.
If this is all we have, we&apos;re done for.
We ventured on without investigating the prisoner.
If only you&apos;d had the money when you had the chance, I&apos;d be willing to talk to you. Goodbye.
*Note his masked servants. What... who... are they?*
*Ahem* Ok, so...
Savegame Version
Pay your respects.
Don&apos;t you doubt it! This old war serpent&apos;s still got some fight left in him, especially now that wound is healed...
*Laugh along with him.*
*Continue to listen.*
Dear one! Dear, dear one. How beautiful you are. How you shine against the misery that surrounds us. You must join us, Sebille. The Great Mother tree is sick. You must help us. Find our kin near the mill: they will tell you.
Easy. Marla&apos;s one of us.
Now go to the greatest mortal city. The last two pieces of the armour rest there.
*His cruel, scraping, booming laughter echoes away inside your mind as he bids you start your work.*
Low
Arx fall? Not on my watch.
The one who will fulfil the Covenant. &apos;tis a pity Braccus did not live to see that day. To feel his own pale marrow drained from his brittle bones.
[Translate36_5cd67ace-374f-4210-b427-dd877ff4ebf1]
Still here? Thought you would&apos;ve gotten cured by now. The Reds usually take pity on the weak ones.
You got it! But you better believe the bill for &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;will be a doozy!
You got a beef with me?
Compare
*Say you were born under the dark moon.*
*Ask this &apos;Tarquin&apos; just who he is exactly.*
He&apos;ll CARVE them all, one by ssssslowly one into your quivering FLESSSH!
*The eyes of predators meet.*
Because my followers are many. My followers are everywhere. Your endeavours are pointless.
Data
Looks like I need to deal with this myself!
So many poor wretches. Hopefully their suffering is at an end now.
Without Source to shield it, the barriers between Nemesis and Rivellon weaken. The Void may be kept at bay. But the plane of demons is not.
Alexandar&apos;s Cloak
*You race through a maze of alleyways as behind you the alarm is raised. You hide in a darkened corner as the pursuing mob draws near... and sense a presence behind you. You turn...*
*Cast bless on the lake*
Now go on. Shoo. You&apos;ve got business to attend to.
And in the unlikely case you don&apos;t manage to do... whatever it is you&apos;ll need to do to become what you need to be become, you could call me. But I would be... &lt;i&gt;grateful &lt;/i&gt;if it doesn&apos;t come to that.
He&apos;s obviously hiding something - best to put a stop to him now.
...stand your ground, dammit!
*The elf raises a bushy eyebrow.*
[LOHSE] *Pause. You don&apos;t think that sounds like the foundation of a very good relationship.*

Isbeil&apos;s Research Notes
*Groan.*
They killed the Magisters, grabbed us, and took off. I came too as a ghost.
*Grunt at the dwarf&apos;s attitude. What were they doing here anyway?*
&apos;ullo.
S&apos;what I get... bloody tainted stew!
Our Shield wants me to save the world, Quercus? From the Knights of Drey? As if it knows the first thing about them!
Painting of Zorl-Stissa
Lohar insists that he&apos;s turned against Queen Justinia. Beast means to do what Lohar asks... for now.
Leaf Crawler
*Let your heart swell with pride and embrace your destiny.*
You get immunity to poison and earth, but lowered resistance to air. You bleed poison.
Damn it, if I can&apos;t kill you with alchemy, I&apos;ll kill you with steel!
*Look her in the eyes. Tell her she&apos;s beautiful. Dive into her.*
*Tell her this is an odd place to find a turtle. Who is her owner?*
Peculiar Seed
There&apos;s a thief on the loose! I must check all of your bags for the stolen goods.
*Joy radiates from her as she remembers. She places a warm hand on your shoulder.*
All I did *hic*... was cheer the bride for the size of her nose!
Let&apos;s don&apos;t make this worse, Lyn. Listen here, whoever you are. We don&apos;t have much to give you, save what we already did. No, we don&apos;t have much... but we do have &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;.
5
Do you know, I can&apos;t help but feel a little sad... all our fun is coming to an end.
Show yourself!
The Paladin leader Lord Linder Kemm, supposedly a devotee of Lucian the Divine, is in fact sworn to the God King!
*...and your furious god begins to speak.*
Strange Cargo
Lord Raizlo Auldritch &apos;The Hasty&apos;
*Decline.*
Ryker remained in his graveyard mansion, served by the spirits newly arrived there. And of those there were many.
There&apos;s every chance the servants of the Great Acorn will skin you alive, frying your bones and boiling your eyes! You could suffer most terrible-
The killer must have left something behind...
Down, down, down by the river...
To think: Just this morning my greatest desire was a bowl of stew. Now... the &lt;i&gt;world &lt;/i&gt;is my stew!
Bock?
*Offer your condolences.*
Savegame will be uploaded to cloud.
Flame Dazzler Grenade
Tell us, brave Tir-Cendelius... tell us how to use their fear against them...
Maybe you prefer taking beatings, hmm? &lt;i&gt;That &lt;/i&gt;more your style?
For Jack
Bloody murder! Looks like someone&apos;s hit the Hall of Echoes a little early.
*The undead&apos;s bony claw pulls an elaborate crossbow from seeming thin air. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;cold&lt;/i&gt; as the grave to the touch, and enveloped in misty shade. He proffers it to you, along with a single rank-smelling arrow.*
*The spirit continues to scowl unhappily.*
Impossible... &lt;i&gt;Impossible...&lt;/i&gt;
A fresh Godwoken, ready for induction *Krrsstssk* Very good. I am here to serve.
C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know what to do. Infiltrate the tavern at Driftwood. Find a mark whose identity can serve you. Then: trap and kill Godwoken. Top price from our client for each one. Bring their heads to me at the Sawmill to cash in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R.
Miaow! *purr*
Soon I shall reach the sea bed. No more shall I dance on the ocean. The end... is... almost... here.
*He turns to you. Gives you a sad smile. Turns away again.*
An empty perfume bottle with the lingering hint of an exceedingly beguiling scent. Your only desire is to keep sniffing it forever.
*The dwarf snaps around to look at you, panic filling his sapphire eyes.*
*Show Gareth the helm you found. It, too, is a purging device, and should destroy the Shriekers.*
What in the name of Lucian&apos;s prize pig is going on here?!
Do you know my mother? Here she is - here she is before me. Finally.
*The statue gestures toward the heavens, a striking image amidst the graves and sepulchres.*
Oh Marcus. How... &lt;i&gt;usual&lt;/i&gt; of you. Of course there&apos;s only one reason you&apos;d come to Arx. Heed my advice and &lt;i&gt;leave &lt;/i&gt;this place before you do something stupid.
*Declare that you know she&apos;s been selling contraband - that belonged to &lt;i&gt;the missing Magisters.*&lt;/i&gt;
I was famous for them. They&apos;re very valuable.
*He lowers his gaze, then looks up at you expectantly.*
*Ask if they&apos;re behind the Shriekers.*
Dungeon Dark 02
*Say that you encountered a man hiding from Magisters in the fish factory.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without helping the spirit of Vilnx Creeva.
Waypoints
Pants of Benevolence
To an elf, maybe. To me, it meant food on the table and enough gold to pay the doctor. Never know when a hat spider&apos;ll getcha!
*She averts her eyes, staring at the ground.*
*And as the black shadow of eternity looms over him, he becomes hysterical...*
Herb is still growing!

*Before you go any further, say you want to speak about Sadha first.*
Saheila says the Scion is the one last hope of the elves. Saheila speaks the name: &apos;Sebille&apos;.
*Beneath the Magister-bestowed garb, you can see an old and faded tattoo on the Silent Watcher&apos;s arm: a heart, a name, a life long gone.*
Mitts of Manipulation
Too bad this diamond looks so... used.
Blitz Attack
Because it will be a turning point in the history of our people... but its outcome is not yet set in stone, dear Prince. Our Empire can weather all storms, with the right guiding hand.
...since I&apos;ve had names on my skin.
