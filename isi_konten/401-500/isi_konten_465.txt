You look... you look so &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;. How are you, darling?
Please. Forgive me!
This spear&apos;s Elven origin can be traced by the crow talons protruding from it.
*Wait for the queen to respond. Perhaps she might still do the right thing.*
Golden Lever
*The beast clicks towards you on metal claws, body contorted out of all natural proportion. Its jaws scrape together, rust flecks dusting the oily ground beneath, yet it says nothing. &lt;i&gt;It can say nothing.*&lt;/i&gt;
Any enemy of Dallis can&apos;t be all that bad... let&apos;s leave him to carry on his work.
*Tell her you&apos;ll split whatever treasure you find down there, fifty-fifty.*
Alright. But Magister Atusa is overdue. She promises to come at noon. We are afraid to stay, afraid to leave...
*Purse your lips with impatience and wish this elven nonsense was over.*
As a merchant, it is quite my favourite day of the year.
I, uh. Well, I mean, just... look at you. I&apos;d be a fool to turn ya down...
I&apos;ve had a thousand years of chatter! No honey, it&apos;s time for action.
*Tell him you seek to be free. Scar first; the Master second.*
Hey. Thanks. I&apos;d shake your hand, but I&apos;d probably just try to lift more off you meanwhile. So. Bye.
Almira&apos;s Request
Enjoying this, aren&apos;t you.
Don&apos;t expect no small portions, same size and price for everyone.
Scarecrows are called that for a reason...
*They draw you in, and as you press down on his body you can feel yourself twisting, falling into those eyes - falling into infinity...*
On his return to the Empire, the Red Prince was hailed a hero. He married Sadha and they had many more dragons. Soon, the prince became the emperor. Faced with dragons, the Void did not gain the upper hand in the Empire.
Voidwoken Statue
Oh, very good. Very, very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good.
Loic&apos;s Discipline
They departed from the rightful path of the Divine. Lord Kemm showed them the path to the light, but, alas, they cast their lot with the God King. Of this I have no doubt.
*He yanks away your pack and fishes the evidence from it.*
*Say that song is the only real nonsense around. Come, we haven&apos;t the time for idle spirit chat!*
&apos;Her munificence Dallis the Hammer, Scourge of the Voidwoken and Saviour of the Sourcerers, &apos;pon the Advice of her Most Sage Counsel...&apos;
*Swear you&apos;ve done nothing wrong.*
Inner Demon Skillbook
I see you, dwarf.
Mordus&apos; Skill Research
Now to find out what kind of person keeps a talking skull in their basement...
[DWARF] [OUTLAW] *Scoff. She&apos;s got naught to do but argue with a brother acting under orders?*
Barrel Chamber Key
Magister Julian is dead. The investigation is over.
There should be at least one Vignette
You there. A word!
*He looks at the corpses surrounding him. Wife and son, lives snuffed out as he watched. He tries to choke back tears, but soon they flow free, carving rivers through the grime on his face.*
Sell
Once you are Sworn, there is no escape - your life is the God King&apos;s. Fail or betray him, and you are doomed... unless you find a way to &lt;i&gt;break &lt;/i&gt;the Covenant. That is where you come in, my dear.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. What became of the lich, we do not know.
Dagger
You are no better than he. Traitor! TRAITOR! TRAITOR!
Hungry Zombie
Ah yes. I am the Prime Scion. A revelation that came quite of the blue - which is somewhat ironic considering I&apos;m supposed to be my people&apos;s foremost memory keeper.
*Wonder what he knows about this object.*
*Raise an eyebrow and ask if he has anything else stowed on his person.*
*You might be interested, but you have some questions first.*
If you want to talk, then stow your weapons first.
*Smile. &apos;Little gods&apos;. Tell her she&apos;s awfully confident.*
Auto-Sell Items
*Unsmiling, she kicks the door open.*
Truly impressive, how you navigated your way through my little test. There&apos;s few sharp minds in Arx these days, I fear...
To expand our Source we had to risk enthrallment and kiss the succubus Almira.
*Say you are very comfortable and in your element with the game&apos;s features.*
The plan&apos;s simple - completely foolproof. I have a spell that I can use to teleport you right out of here. I can&apos;t use it on myself... but with your help, we can both get out of here.
Lord only knows how the boss managed to find a buyer for this muck, but they&apos;re heading to Arx. And there&apos;s some steady gold headin&apos; this way too.
What can I do for you?&lt;br&gt;
Still, there&apos;s something about you. I see guilt in your eyes. Prove your innocence!
Lying cur! Get away from me!
My troubles &lt;i&gt;are not over! &lt;/i&gt;I&apos;ve been interred in the wrong part of the damn cemetery, with no care given to lizard burial customs!
Hahaha! Oh dear! I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re a long way from home, milord; a long way from the little bells that make footmen come a-running!
*First things first. Dragons? What is she talking about?*
*Ask what Horrorsleep is.*
Do I smell... smoke?
A dwarf of principle. I get it. Wonder how you&apos;ll feel when whoever did this does it again.
You! Tell me what you know about the recent assaults!
You rightfully consider me a scoundrel, but I&apos;d rather you think of me as a... lovable scamp. One that you can rely on.
With a forge I could fix this, maybe.
*The corpse rocks gently, as if shifting in sleep - and then &lt;i&gt;splits&lt;/i&gt; to release surging vines.*
Make the hinges rust!
I owe Alexandar everything. I don&apos;t regret standing by him.
The Murderous Gheist
*Remind her of Herman. What would she do if it happened to her?*
Eliminate the demon Adramahlihk.
*Reassure him that he&apos;ll be okay. Maybe you can even help?*
Papa Thrash
*A young woman shifts her weight between her feet, as though swaying her hips to an imaginary beat. She rubs her forehead, her face tight with concern.*
But you&apos;re not &apos;just anyone&apos;, are you Beast?&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, lady. Now if you don&apos;t mind we&apos;re busy waiting for our friend.
*Tell him that you found a secret entrance into the Council.*
*You falter. The King? That&apos;s not possible.*
Strawberry
Speak with the spirits.
Glad you&apos;re safe. Send your leader my way for a chat when you can, eh?
*Tell him to stay his blade. You will take care of the monks.*
*He bows to an almost comical depth, then rises and laughs.*
*BARK!*
I&apos;m merely appraising the many antiques gathered in here in this beautiful mansion.
I cannot believe the Sourcerer slipped through our fingers...
That&apos;s not really what I had in mind.
*Encourage her anger. Her fury is righteous; this is the way of the God King!*
Ah. You missed out on a special lad, then. He had faith. &lt;i&gt;Real &lt;/i&gt;faith. That&apos;s rare these days.
Deathfog
The One will become &lt;i&gt;Divine.&lt;/i&gt;
Giant Source Puppet
Decide what to do with Justinia&apos;s letter.
Arhu the wizard served the new Divine with honour, wisdom, and an at-times-unnerving feline elegance.
Farmyard 05
[ELF] *Express sorrow for the voice. It was simply lonely.*
*Nod in agreement. You did your best.*
*Close your eyes: take a brief moment to ready yourself for what is to come.*
*Stealing the Source of the other lords means they&apos;d be left as mortals. Or worse. The thought makes you feel uncomfortable.*
*He raises his lifeless face, then lowers it again to contemplate the splintered, bloody boards.*
What dwarf in their right mind wants to listen to this dribble? Can&apos;t wait &apos;til he changes it up.
A puddle of... something. I feel it calling to me.
Eh?
Reduces physical resistance of nearby enemies.
Destroy the Shriekers.
Independent
You should know that I forced you to shed the blood of Scions because rather than a killer, it transformed you into a saviour of untold millions.
*Look around for some way to help her.*
*...and kisses you softly, soft as your first time, then harder, deeper, her tongue swirling around yours.*
The city of Arx awaits. I think I&apos;ll catch myself an arch-demon come Lucian&apos;s Day.
Blessing of Summer
Without our Scions, everything we are - everything we have done - is lost.
*You see billows of golden sand stretching beyond the whorls and whirls that roll across the portal&apos;s surface. It isn&apos;t clear if the portal allows return travel - but you&apos;re inclined to doubt it.*
Bromley
*Ask what kind of proof he needs.*
Sound the horn and shout the battlecry...
Taunted
[VILLAIN] *Allow a wicked grin to spread across your face in anticipation of what&apos;s about to happen.*
You won&apos;t regret it. Or, to &apos;ut it another way, you won&apos;t live to regret it.
Or did you really think I&apos;d play slavishly along with your ridiculous scheme, Dallis? Yes, I played my part of the servile stooge, but know this:
*He relaxes and chuckles to himself. You walk away.*
All across the realm she was loved, worshiped and adored.
*Announce the death of Lord Arhu.*
You can read more, if you&apos;re interested.
So the point is... well, I ain&apos;t sure. I guess that she has a good heart. But somewhere along the way, it got soiled.
*Draw the middle straw.*
You hesitate because you&apos;re afraid. It&apos;s fine to be afraid. Just try to trust me.
Naivety. Stupidity. Call it what you want. I wished to put the Source within me to good use, and demonology seemed as good a use as any. Silly me.
*The crystalline artefact is both beautiful and robust; as pure as glass, and as immutable as iron.*
There&apos;s a lot of call for the junk you sell, then?
*Observe that she&apos;s in a good mood.*
We defeated the denizens of the Horrorsleep. We swore to defeat the God King and free Sadha, the Red Princess, from her bonds to him.
*The squirrel leans forward and wraps his arms around his cat&apos;s neck. They wait together as they fade away to nothing.*
*He stares at you for a few torturing moments.*
This is my family. My hen-friends and my egg baby, back! This is my family.
Then why, pray tell, are you wasting both my time and your own? Go!
We took Mummie Dearest&apos;s head.
But you don&apos;t. And what would they find? The flesh of dumb animals, born for the pot. Nothing more.
What&apos;s your job? You look like a magic-maker. Like me! But maybe not so strong.
*The spirit offers no resistance. He just vanishes.*
A brood of panicking hens lost their eggs.
Thank you, Sebille. I know I can count on you. You must climb the temple to find the Mother&apos;s heart. And then you must destroy it.
Buzz off, eh?
A marksman with a legendary knack for self-preservation
*The spirit of Audrey looks around, confused and vulnerable. She doesn&apos;t seem to see you.*
When we arrived at the fallen lizard embassy, the sorrowful memory returned. We learned we must talk to the lizard Dreamer in order to meet the Devourer.
I think as long as I might lose myself at any moment, I&apos;ll feel like a &lt;i&gt;bit &lt;/i&gt;of a stranger, no matter where I go.
Dazing Bolt Skillbook
Still, I can&apos;t say I am completely displeased. Perhaps this... was not all for naught.
*Hold steady and call to Windego. She must join you in resistance. Together, you can refuse the King her spirit.*
*Leave the box alone.*
Go, use your powers... &lt;i&gt;feast on the fallen.&lt;/i&gt;
The Magisters attacked us.
*Rest your hand on the statue&apos;s wing.*
[OUTLAW] *Tell him it looks like someone got him right under the ribs with a shortblade. A professional, probably.*
*The nurse throws you a sultry look, offset by the smear of blood around her mouth.*
*He reaches out and takes your hand, turning it this way and that, examining it from every angle. Finally he pinches your skin, gently tugging at it.*
