[SWORN] *Tell her it&apos;d be an honour, bid her begin the Endless Prayer... while silently you pray to your King.*
Mmm?
An empty pedestal... I wonder what once stood here?
Okay.
Now that I know I have your affection, here&apos;s a little token of my own.
We&apos;ll earn the right to sing our tale...
Leave Party
*She raises a single eyebrow as a sensual smile plays upon her ghostly lips.*
That&apos;s fine, Lohse. You don&apos;t have to speak. But &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;listen.
I see your potential has begun to shine through.
On the Nameless Isle, Godwoken ascend. They &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; use Eternal technology. Perhaps this is how I may save my people.
[BARBARIAN] *Scowl. Art? Tea? Chit-chat? You&apos;re getting out while the getting&apos;s good.*
None
But of course I won&apos;t refuse you. I&apos;ll do my best to drive the demon out, &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; you do what I&apos;ve asked.
*Ask what he did to deserve such a punishment in the first place.*
It sure looked angry.
*Note that Braccus Rex seemed anything but just.*
Drain [1] from target character and gain that amount for yourself.
*Seven others stand with you - the short one and fire-breather among them. They gaze upon the portal, entranced and obsessed. Another of the seven - the graceful one, hands delicate as blown glass - reaches to the barrier.*
*So he&apos;s a Magister - and a traitor to boot. Take his Source with zeal.*
*Stand aside and allow Beast his say.*
I have granted your spirit eyes with which to see the Source, now I shall grant it teeth with which to &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; it!
Ifan... To behold you in this naked glory is to surmount the boundaries of existence and step into a more perfect universe.
*Wonder why seeing you does him good. Plenty of other dwarves about.*
Let&apos;s get this divinity thing over with, shall we? This is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much more fun.
We were scholars, priests and priestesses. We sought to study the evils of the world so that we could defeat them... instead, we were consumed.
[1] is Global and cannot be destroyed
Sign back in
*Say you want part of what he has. You wish to join his crew.*
Gloves of Acquisition
*Try &apos;reveal&apos;.*
Lock Level
*Nod and take your leave.*
Lords no, you&apos;re as Void-tainted as them! Back - get back!
*What?! Demand to know why they&apos;d kill Quercus!*
Captain Armour Set
Medical Cabinet
Deathfog
*Tell her you didn&apos;t want it to end like this.*
Spirit of Conway Pryce
*Oink* Squeeeeee! *Grunt*
*Thank her for her time and step away.*
A valiant warrior against the void...
Yeah. Right.
Lady
One lies in the lizard&apos;s enclave; the other in the hands of a man named Kemm.
*He breathes a sigh of relief.*
*She takes you by the shoulders and gestures for you to do the same to her. She closes her eyes, and a warm, soothing sensation runs from her hands into your body. Suddenly, you feel the familiar swell of Source within you.*
Spirit of a Collared Sourcerer
Locket of the Lake
*The unlit candle nearby flickers briefly to life. The spirit shakes her head and waves you off.*
*A lizard on all fours lies chained in the pit. The raw power you sense within her is barely contained by the spell that binds her.*
Then I&apos;ll send my men and women to sniff &apos;er out. She may think to stay covert, but royalty is... easily divined.
Why?
Spirit of a Farmer
Alchemy Trader
*Gareth&apos;s eyes grow wide. He looks to the ring in your outstretched hand, and then to you.*
This heavy shield has seen a hundred battles, but so sturdily was it wrought that it still looks brand new.
Yevlin
Crow Flee
*The soul jar stands on its plinth, glowing softly. From within you can almost hear the whisper of a voice.*
Highlight an enemy, press [IE_ContextMenu] and select &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;&apos;Examine&apos;&lt;/font&gt;. The higher your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Loremaster&lt;/font&gt; ability, the more you can learn about your target.
*The Sourcerer fidgets, and you notice a thin dagger resting in his palm. He slices away a bit of rope, then looks to you, eyebrows raised.*
*Another gurgle. Sharper. &lt;i&gt;Angrier.&lt;/i&gt; Then the sound of rapid footfalls rushing towards you...*
*Say he could still be an emperor. The God King is a magnanimous divinity.*
Are you proud of all you achieved?
Oh, Godwoken. I do tend to overestimate you, don&apos;t I? I can&apos;t restore Anathema if you don&apos;t bring me both the blade and the shaft. Two halves make a whole. It&apos;s simple maths, really.
*The spirit of the Paladin continues to observe the harbour. He glances around, as if looking for a discreet way to sneak off.*
No refunds! But if you&apos;re unhappy with your journey, I&apos;ll happily take you back to where it began. Hahahahaha! For a trifling consideration, of course! Hahahahahahahahahaha!
Did you... hear something?
Bandit Lizard Elementalist
*You get a reward, it goes free. Sounds like a good deal.*
It&apos;s quite simple, really. Chaos is a fact of life, surer than any other. Power is one of the few structures that can cut a line through that chaos.
Well, well, well. I&apos;d recognise that ugly mug anywhere. Can&apos;t have been easy walking out of that arena with that particular bloody stump. I must say I&apos;m impressed.
Featherfall
Is it? I would have accepted that once, but now? Now that I know you...
The cook was killed. The investigation is over.
Thanks for understanding. Now, eh, let&apos;s keep moving...
Thank Duna&apos;s blessed beard that&apos;s over, because I&apos;m done with this.
*Justinia smiles widely and bows to you, the Beast of the Sea, the Godwoken, the Divine in waiting. You will do her proud. You will do your people proud.*
*Back away.*
I do not have... er, I ain&apos;t got no time for talking - dwarf or not. I&apos;ve got to carry on with my job.
The kraken dragged the ship under. We survived - barely.
*Tell her you&apos;ve heard enough. You&apos;d like to go.*
Mordus proved a useful tool in the fight against the Void.
This is the task I lay before you. It isn&apos;t small, but it is yours to carry... or to abandon.
And can you prove this?
The Thing Inside
I&apos;m going to &lt;i&gt;beat&lt;/i&gt; you like I did before. I&apos;m going to &lt;i&gt;bleed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bind&lt;/i&gt; you, and what&apos;s left of you - no more than a battered bit of meat - I&apos;m going to deliver to the Master all over again.
*Tell him he&apos;s been through a lot, and should try to get some rest.*
Edit Talents
A cog, a strip of aluminium, some old wire...
Blessed are the stars you were born under, then. That treacherous night walker saw us undone, and cast into this hell.
*The spirit&apos;s vacant eyes show no sign of awareness.*
Network initialisation failed
*Plead with the Magister. These people have witnessed the execution of their own children. Haven&apos;t they suffered enough?*
I&apos;m told Justinia came to express her best wishes to the bride and her father. Whether the queen&apos;s still inside after all the commotion, I can&apos;t say. I imagine Ros found Justinia a suitable hiding place.
We gave a potion to Mabel the cow and asked nothing in return.
[1] gives you [2] to Constitution and +[3] to Intelligence.
Raise Bone Widow
Still, I hope I don&apos;t have to do &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; again anytime soon.
Leave me be, sister. This traitor needs my attention.
[SCHOLAR] *You&apos;re intrigued to notice this is another statue of Amadia, very alike to the one you saw in the dungeons of Fort Joy.*
*A flash of annoyance pierces the healer&apos;s craggy, tired face. He jabs the bit of his pipe into your chest - hard.*
By Amadia, I feel- I feel... wet. Oh goddess, I can feel your tears upon my face!
My aims were, &lt;i&gt;are, &lt;/i&gt;no less than the God King&apos;s triumph. That&apos;s all you can know.
[ELF] Now Arx knows how it felt when Lucian killed the elves.
*Deep inside, you can feel Zorl-Stissa stirring. You hear a faint chuckle. She remembers this one...*
If I trusted no-one, I&apos;d spend my days hiding in some room with a crossbow trained on the door. We&apos;ll take our chances.
[SOLDIER] *The queen&apos;s armies are some of the bravest around. Say that it&apos;s sad to see a dwarf cowering in a hole.*
Ink Pot
[UNDEAD] *You have some personal experience of history. You&apos;ve seen a lot in the last couple of centuries...*
*You wave your hand right in front of his eyes. He shows no sign of &lt;i&gt;seeing &lt;/i&gt;you, but his nostrils flare and a thick rope of spittle drips from his slack mouth.*
*The altar lies in silence, glowing faintly with a familiar, comforting warmth.*
The Necromancer
There... may be an accident or two along the way. Please don&apos;t hold it against them.
*Stand between him and Alexandar. You&apos;ll handle this.*
Paradise Downs
You must *cough* excuse my state, I had a rather forceful disagreement with some rose-coloured constabulary. But come, we have much to discuss.
*Grunt* Just make it quick...
*A fly buzzes around the dwarf&apos;s mutilated head. For a moment it lands, crawls across his open eye, and takes off again. The Silent Watcher does not blink.*
*Lift her chin and kiss her. Tell her you&apos;re going to love her for the rest of her long, long life.*
*Apologise and return the stolen goods.*
*Tell him that you spoke to Murga, and she refuses to fight you.*
Sourcebleeder
Yes of course! Of course, milord...
*Ask her about this dispatch: did it truly mention you?*
*Take a step back and ask her who she is.*
I&apos;m well aware of what you couldn&apos;t do.
Bloody shambles, this. You shouldn&apos;t be here...
Bigger And Better
May her sin be forgiven and her name forgotten. This we pray, in Lucian&apos;s name.
Easy, girl! I&apos;m happy to see you too.
They would never be forgotten.
That story&apos;s better than the last one, that&apos;s for certain. Keep them coming!
Poor Hammond. Why does elf-magic have to be so bloody disgusting?
Wonder how far we are from shore. This whole Meistr business sounds pretty exciting.
Leya... yeh were too good for this world, girl.
*Quietly walk away and leave the two of them to their conversation.*
*Spare a guarded thought for the Godwoken you know and have known.*
You can... you can see it?
I don&apos;t want your money, &lt;i&gt;thief!&lt;/i&gt;
*Let the words hang there, chilling the air.*
I&apos;m just going to find a place to &lt;i&gt;rest... &lt;/i&gt;a place where I can be how I am supposed to be...
As for myself, I do apologise for my ungentlemanlike behaviour, but I see through, just like you desire. I see what&apos;s inside of you.
Come out, Sourcerer! No harm will come to you!
Even if a demon eats my whole brain?
Salamander
I would tell the story of the Godwoken to anyone who would listen.
*Or did you only hear what you wanted to hear in the whispers of the wind?*
Captive Deep-dweller
We met the Scion again in Reaper’s Coast.
Ahhhoooooooooo!
Shocked Cow
Pull the rope. Maybe that&apos;ll work!
The God King
Trophies Disabled
As a matter of fact, yes. Dallis was quite lucky to escape the Voidwoken. It destroyed her ship, but the Hammer herself made it into the city all right.
[BEAST] *Tell him there is no justice, not in this world.*
Give all summons and totems around you a status that prevents them dying from damage or disappearing when their life runs out.
We already pried away that spear, and he has helped us to escape. I&apos;d say our business is concluded.
Warmachine
And so I met with Bahara in the sanctuary of Amadia. We raced through dream-wastes, beset by nightmares, until we reached the voice!
*Tell her you&apos;ll look out for Gwydian.*
*One last embrace, lips hot upon lips.*
I know quality when I see it, and I bet you do too! Care to trade?
