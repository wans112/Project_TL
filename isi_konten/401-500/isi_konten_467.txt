Golden Key found on the shipwrecked Lord Dread
*The chick&apos;s joyous flutters launch a few stray sparks into the air. It is elated by the very sight of its adopted father.*
*Take offence. Tell him that Tir-Cendelius deems you worthy of divinity!*
The gods speak like petty tyrants. Let&apos;s not cut each other&apos;s throats in their name, but stand by each other in our own.
This rustic axe will do the job, if the job is chopping down a tree. Or chopping off a head.
*Kneel beside her and ask what you can do.*
*Reach out and touch his face. He looks incredible...*
Main Menu
*Tell her she looks like she&apos;s in bad shape. Ask if she ought not to take it easy.*
But. Take this. Perhaps it helps you on your journey. You feel my gratitude in it. You feel my thanks.
Damned fool - you&apos;ll see. You&apos;ll see when it happens to you...
Well if it ain&apos;t so-and-so! Ha - just kiddin&apos;, Fane. We&apos;re good together, like sea salt &apos;n&apos; taties, or jam on sweetbread. Y&apos;care to team up? I&apos;d say your stew could use a bit of Beastly flavour, if ya catch my meanin&apos;.
Ring of Dusk
This hat is so fine and dandy that anyone who speaks to you while you wear it will be convinced that you are a noble.
Get away from me, you creep.
There&apos;s only one payment I will accept: your life!
Enter the tomb.
*Wonder how the likes of him wound up in a place like this.*
Yes, Sebille. You are the Prime Scion. &lt;i&gt;Accept.&lt;/i&gt;
I won&apos;t leave her side, not until she wakes. My heart stopped beating, and my flesh fell away. No matter - I&apos;m staying here.
You do not even know her, yet you are true to her, prince, and I applaud you for it. But I will not let you leave without my blessing.
Durability
*Say you didn&apos;t know princes put so much stock in their afternoon nap.*
Find some drudanae.
*He shudders at the memory.*
*The well remains as dark and dry as it was, and still the voices beg for water.*
*Agree. Say that you&apos;re dying to find out if any of this could be real.*
*You remain adamant. She&apos;s a dangerous woman.*
We couldn&apos;t... I &lt;i&gt;couldn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;... is it really our fault? The Voidwoken?
Ice Dazzler Grenade
Kaavrk the Bloodstalker
*Reach out a hand to comfort her.*
Gallows
A murderer or a Sourcerer or some other species of miscreant. Whichever it is, it has nothing to do with me, except that it&apos;s stopping me shipping my fish into Arx. Now please...
It is power you seek. To conjure maelstroms and command the light to drive away shadow.
*Say you&apos;re sorry, but you did what had to be done.*
Allow me first to see your companions to safety.
Which of us hasn&apos;t lied to get what they want? Maybe their lies can benefit us.
You should have saved the others before me, stranger. They were in far worse condition than I was. Thank you anyway, I suppose.
Adieu and good luck. The Lord Dread awaits - the use of the gallows &lt;i&gt;I pass on to you&lt;/i&gt;.
Keep your chin up, kid.
Priest
You did? Divine blessings, she must be so worried.
You shall regret this! &lt;i&gt;YOU SWORE!&lt;/i&gt;
Note of Congratulations
Can&apos;t think of anywhere he&apos;d rather be than here by my side, at this terrible time.
I humbly thank you. You won&apos;t regret it!
We found letters in the Wreckers&apos; Cave, but they don&apos;t incriminate Lohar. Our search continues.
*Roll your eyes at this weakling and attack. He should pose no threat.*
Just when the agony subsides, another pilgrim makes her way to the shrine and puts flame to the torches. They think to honour me. Instead, they incinerate me.
I saw her fall. She was done. Now get out of my face.
May he always choose the right path with you to guide him.
*He pauses again, hand running down his beard once more, contemplating. He looks up and meets your gaze with his good eye. He holds out one of his great hands.*
Empty Grenade
Voidwoken killed the Meistr. There was nothing we could do.
Oh, but you&apos;re a clever one, aren&apos;t you, prince? Fine - I&apos;m tired of pretending I serve this weak wench, anyway. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
Electric Ray
*Ask where she plans to go.*
Carriage
Poison Slug
&apos;course I&apos;m right. Stick with me, kid. I won&apos;t steer you wrong.
Gone be &lt;i&gt;hell&lt;/i&gt; full stop, you mark my words.
I reckon...
You wanna know the truth? I don&apos;t think it means anything at all. I think it means... if you live a life, things will happen. Crazy things. Painful things. Fantastic things. You can&apos;t pick which ones you&apos;ll get. All you can do is live &apos;em.
Well if it ain&apos;t so-and-so! Ha - I&apos;m just kiddin&apos;, Lohse. We&apos;re good together, like sea salt &apos;n&apos; taties, or jam on sweetbread. Y&apos;care to team up? I&apos;d say your stew could use a bit of Beastly flavour, if ya catch my meanin&apos;.
STOP THAT! &lt;i&gt;NOW!&lt;/i&gt;
The Meistr must have known the combination to the hatch in her house - but she&apos;s dead.
*Tell her that Windego has powerful allies. You must learn what she knows.*
*The elves pick Sarias&apos;s bloody corpse from the ground.*
I couldn&apos;t help but overhear... it&apos;s Roost you&apos;re looking for? He&apos;s my pack leader.
Right Alt
Physical Resistance
Look at that: a fresh face! Stout &apos;n&apos; sturdy: just how I like my dwarves!
No match for the bomber pair at the bridgeside cottage, right Barin?
You cannot risk failure. The only thing you can use the powers of the Divine for is to protect Rivellon.
Amadia&apos;s Ice Ward
&lt;b&gt;Pathetic. Truly pathetic. Perhaps her true name would have helped. Perhaps not.&lt;/b&gt;
*He finishes the death rite.*
*You&apos;re bemused. Who &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;this guy?*
Cannot be cured by mundane means. Targeting range and Accuracy reduced.
Paladin Shield
This crudely whittled toy sword is designed for a child to cut their eyeteeth on, not for you to cut throats.
What&apos;s happening?! Goddess, what&apos;s wrong? Please, speak to your priestess!
[VILLAIN] *Tell him you&apos;re more familiar with others running away from &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Gedeon, the Tenacious One
Fine. The job&apos;s all yours. &apos;course first you&apos;ll have to put the fire out, at least so&apos;s you can reach the cellar hatch.
Quite the hand, freshie! Unfortunately, two is less than five and that&apos;s how many Purples I&apos;ve got. I reckon that makes me the winner. I&apos;ll be havin&apos; your fee then...
Waltz&apos;s Staff
Or perhaps now you are willing to help me discover the mysteries of death?
*Ask where the rest of her sisters are.*
Sorry, but I&apos;ve got my orders. Got enough trouble roaming around these parts. Don&apos;t need any more.
We agreed to help Almira and Mihaly flee.
Magister Swordsman
Then you are my next meal. My soul is within my grasp!
...and there ain&apos;t no amount of hollerin&apos; that&apos;ll bring her back.
Came in to help someone escape and got nabbed before I could sneak back out. I&apos;d ask you the same question, but we&apos;re a little short on time here.
*Say hello to the little girl, then ask what &lt;i&gt;she&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;doing down here...*
*He turns wordlessly, and takes his first steps toward a new life.*
*The maggot fights the pull of the forceps, and sinks its hooked maw into brain matter. A chunk comes away with it as you pull it off.*
The dice roll darkly... They&apos;re rolling for me...
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. Edie Engrym still waits to hear her name.
*Sigh.* Do I &lt;i&gt;look &lt;/i&gt;like I am in a position to teach you anything? No, you need someone of flesh and bone. No offence.
*Tell him this is a big ask. Ask how he intends to compensate you.*
Yes. You&apos;re right. Thankfully, I&apos;ve had time to think. I had a good friendship with Jonathan while it lasted. I&apos;d rather celebrate that than mourn what can never be.
The results of his research allowed us to recreate purging wands based on an ancient design he found. Much of our research was built off what that which went before.
Don&apos;t underestimate Scrolls: one of those tiny pieces of parchment used at the right moment can turn the tide of battle!
*Your skull warms. The roar of the flames drowns the screams. Syrus Oates begins to burn. He does not scream.*
Uh... I dunno... do I?
Come now! All we will undo is demons. I&apos;m not asking you to yank the hearts from newborn chests. You&apos;ll reconsider, of course you will!
*Quietly request its blessing.*
*Lower your head. You&apos;re not sure how much you matter to him - but &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; matters to &lt;i&gt;you. &lt;/i&gt;You will submit to him. You will fight at his side. He will ascend.*
OH MY GODS YOU&apos;RE UGLY. Grbbt.
*Take your leave.*
How is it possible? One minute you&apos;re in the garden, in the sun. The next, you&apos;re here and they&apos;ve put... this &lt;i&gt;thing &lt;/i&gt;around your neck.
Aw! So yeh look back on those fanciful days all fondly? Wouldn&apos;t have thought it, but there ya be. One royalist tune comin&apos; up!
*Complete the triptych - return the real Second Passion of Lucian to its rightful place.*
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 2: The Birth of the Gods
Valiant one! Do you have new tales to tell?
*The dog sniffs the wooden decking, like there&apos;s something wrong.*
Bock bock bock BEGACK!
The djinn escaped the lamp and attacked on sight.
*The roots of a great ancestor tree reach from deep underground to the surface above and beyond. But this tree feels... tainted.*
If I cannot gift you one boon, I shall gift you another. It would be such a shame to see this Source be simply left languishing in its current vessel, after all.
Leave Party
*Circus? Ask what she means.*
Dallis The Hammer &amp; The Solution of Fort Joy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*In a profile so complimentary it may almost be described as ‘gushing’, Huwbert tells the story of Dallis the Hammer’s rise from her exploits in the war against the Black Ring as a leader of integrity and steel to becoming the architect of Alexandar’s programme of suppression of Sourcery and the creator of the camp on Fort Joy. He lauds her intuition, her drive, and - most of all - her compassion and grace in dealing with the Sourcerers, whom he describes as poor unfortunates.*
But of course I already knew what you really are. Or do you mean to tell me memory is so fleeting within the hollows of that windswept head of yours that you don&apos;t recall me running my dainty tongue along your arm?
Playing With Fire&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Huwbert’s short description of the great pyrokinetics who can create fire out of nothing is full of admiration - and disdain. While he admires their tricks and acknowledges their value in a fight, he points out that many an innocent village has burned due solely to a Sourcerer’s inflated assessment of their ability to control the uncontrollable.*
*Laslor&apos;s face softens. He lays his large, heavy hands on your shoulders and looks you squarely in the eye.*
Together we can do this. Together we can save Lucian. Together we are the &lt;i&gt;truth.&lt;/i&gt; What do you say?
The Magisters are out for blood! You saw the body, didn&apos;t you? Big bruiser like you ought to be able to take &apos;em on.
*Deny it, saying that you don&apos;t know what she&apos;s talking about.*
If I ever go to Arx I&apos;ll be sure to check out this black house.
*The nerve! Slap away his hand, hard.*
Are you trying to play me for a fool?
Time will tell, but I think whatever just happened is a good sign.
I&apos;ve waited this long. I can wait longer.
Fool. You&apos;re letting your pride hold you back!
Door&apos;s open for now... but I&apos;ve a mind to close it.
