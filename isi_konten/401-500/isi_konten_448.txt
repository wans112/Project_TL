Ahaha. Aha. There is &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; thing.
You rat! That it&apos;s come to this! Dwarf stealing from dwarf! Here: take it! You might as well! So you can pay for a good seat when this world comes to an end! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
I used to be the head of the Seekers, lass. I could spot your aura a league away.
To trade one&apos;s soul for immortality and then lose out on your prize? That is unfortunate, no matter the circumstances.
So wake now, prince. Wake and be wary. Be wary of the shadows that would snuff out the sunshine.
when a resentful courtier stabbed her to death with a mutton fork.
*Reject her offer. You&apos;d rather not paint a target on your back.*
*Recognising you, she opens her hand to show you her rings...*
Worm Tremor Skillbook
Hiding in the Fishworks, the fugitive Higba denied involvement in the Magister disappearances. He begged us to sneak him out of town.
Back off, pigeon. This is my bridge... and I don&apos;t suffer fools on it.
How can it be that it suddenly summons these... these horrors from the Void? And when will Alexandar ascend to Divinity? We cannot continue like this.
Now, come on... back into a cage where you belong.
What goes on between me and my new family is no concern of some passing vagabond.
Ryker
Oh dear. You assume your reputation precedes you. And I&apos;m afraid that I can&apos;t honour such idle bragging with my... favours.
Civilisations rise and fall. We should be thankful that at least the Gods resulted from these... forgotten people.
*Relent and let Fane talk to the Voidwoken.*
The salamander&apos;s dead master had a magic chest. The magic words came from an ancient lizard dialect.
*He spits in your face.*
*Kill Lohar.*
Do I?
Thin Gambeson
Speak with Gareth.
*Raedalus startles, as if waking from a nightmare. He gives you a look of hate... and shame. His weakness, it seems, is absolute.*
You dare to bribe authority. Not very smart, I see. Come with me!
I warned you already! Keep away from me!
Wood Pile
Moving to rapid-descent cranial disruptor!
Moo.
*Shake your head; of course that wasn&apos;t a guess.*
*You still don&apos;t understand. So much hate. Why then - and why now? Search his memories for answers.*
Alright? Oh. Hah! Sure. Mmhmm. It&apos;s just, Malady mentioned the thing in my head&apos;s probably a demon. And there there&apos;s someone close to where we&apos;re headed who might be able to help me with it.
Salt-Stained Note
Divine Reckoning
Oh just the best. Just the bee&apos;s knees, really.
*Fire suddenly rages around you. Acrid smoke stings your eyes and flames dance all over your body... yet you feel no pain whatsoever, and the fire fizzles out as soon as it touches your skin.*
Hey. &lt;i&gt;Hey!&lt;/i&gt; Get me out of this cage and I&apos;ll make it worth your while. You in?
*She smirks. And she&apos;s definitely not smiling &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; you.*
Are you confused or do you always look this dumb?

Flaming Skin
*Tell her it sounded quite serious.*
You speak falsehoods! If I were a Scion, I&apos;d know it. I&apos;d feel it with every beat of my heart!
I&apos;m exactly where I need to be, elf - helping my true brothers however I can!
Magical Elven Staff
For an aging relic, he looks so... knowing.
Absolutely not! He&apos;s still a thief, and likely a Sourcerer as well. No - he&apos;ll face righteous Magister justice, as soon as we find him...
Letter
*Moo.*
What part of &apos;talk sense&apos; passed you by, scales? I ain&apos;t killing my brothers and, if I stay right here, they ain&apos;t killing me.
The so-called Divine himself... &lt;i&gt;Lucian&lt;/i&gt;. What good&apos;s a shrine to those hated by his Order?
&lt;i&gt;Ha!&lt;/i&gt; I am not some commonplace dullard, losing his mind to fear and superstition. Your condition is merely another curio for me to ponder.
Handmade Sword
*He looks at you disapprovingly... but can&apos;t keep a straight face.*
Stop it! It&apos;s rude to just vanish while someone&apos;s talking to you!
Gods, don&apos;t tell it to me, I don&apos;t want to know. We have our own troubles.
*This is a waste of time. Raise your weapon.*
*Ask him to explain. What does he mean by Godwoken?*
A painting of the lonely turrets of the Divine Order scanning Reaper&apos;s Coast. Some Magister with a hankering for the sea must have painted it off-duty.
*Smile. Assure him you&apos;re completely trustworthy.*
Glide
Besides, I asked for help, not directions. That&apos;s my price, if you want to see what I have to offer...
The Holy Hand Grenade will significantly heal everyone in a [1] radius.
*Ask the Paladin how she got that wound.*
*He gives you a strange look, then returns to his watch.*
*Keep looking. You like to look at him.*
It does. She didn&apos;t come to me - I found her on a roadside, unconscious. There were shackles around her wrists - the chains &lt;i&gt;sheared right off &lt;/i&gt;whatever held her. I had to help.
The beast&apos;s unruly passenger did not deign to tell it. He did not want his host to know I crafted a weapon that would leave him an Eternal once more.
Hail, delicate beauty. Call me Dorotya.
You know how I feel about you. That isn&apos;t going to change. Not now. Not ever. But I don&apos;t expect anything from you. I don&apos;t even want anything from you, but to see where this road takes us.
Either way, I doubt any invitation extended to Lord Arhu was &lt;i&gt;social &lt;/i&gt;- my husband has no great love for the man. Sensitive, dull civic matters, I&apos;ll wager.
Good riddance to him - the Divine Order grew soft and divided under his command. He was a failure for all of his life. At least he was consistent right through to his death.
*The Silent Watcher is so still that it&apos;s hard to discern if it&apos;s even breathing.*
*Her eyes roll up to meet yours, their great, black pupils - greater and blacker than seem natural - expanding further as they take you in. She smiles and the worry melts from her face.*
Dwarven Patron

[UNDEAD] *Say you only reveal yourself on a need-to-know basis.*
Bright Ring
*BANG!*
[SOLDIER] *Tell the spirit to compose himself - dead or not, he&apos;s acting like a half-trained recruit.*
This door is operated by &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;pressure plates&lt;/font&gt;. Stand on them, or place heavy objects on them.
*Say you&apos;re ever so sorry he had to put himself out so.*
You&apos;ve a little brain in your skull, if you ask me!

*Lohar takes the amulet and turns it over in his hand. He pockets it matter-of-factly.*
The answer is final, and the answer is &lt;i&gt;no.&lt;/i&gt; Lord Arhu is preparing his Lucian&apos;s Day speech, and cannot be disturbed.
I owe you an apology, Shield. At the start of our journey, I wouldn&apos;t have believed an &lt;i&gt;elf &lt;/i&gt;would lead me to the discovery that would save us all.
*The image strains and flickers again. Each time it comes into focus, an odd sensation tickles your head, like a small, many-legged creature were trying to wriggle its way in through your ear...*
*She bows to you in farewell.*
Delusions of Greatness
Zandalor
[SOLDIER] *Give the Magister a quick salute and report for duty on the good ship...?*
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;This burden is not yours to bear.  Too much has been asked of you already. I will put this right.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Kemm pauses for half a moment, his eyes flickering to the troops around him.*
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;m perfect. I&apos;m wonderful. I&apos;m free at last.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say they&apos;ve been very helpful!*
No, please - have mercy. Please- please!!!
Ma&apos;am! You sent me from the Meadows near Drifwood. Carolan Fluffinster at your service, ma&apos;am!
Creates a small water surface with a [1] radius.
*Hook the robe with a claw and throw it in the air, allowing it to swirl, then in a single fluid movement catch it, fold it over one arm, and present it to her.*
What kind of Divine were you, Ifan,
*Ask what it&apos;s barking at.*
Maybe. Certainly seems Justinia&apos;s got the willpower of a hungry Source hound. But that means what she can get talked into, she can be talked out of.
That isn&apos;t true. I don&apos;t care about them. I mean I do... but the only person I really care about is &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
Mmph. I wasn&apos;t prepared for that. What now?
*Shrug and siphon the spirit&apos;s Source. It&apos;s more useful than this jibber-jabber.*
What did Hallorn believe in? He believed in truth. He believed in hope. He believed that Alexandar is a killer of Godwoken. I believe that on one point, at least, he was right.
*Ask her what she&apos;s doing back on the ship.*
Confront Lovrik.
*The Dreamer&apos;s disappointment is palpable, but she is more resigned than surprised.*
As long as the jar stays unbroken, I can never truly die.

*They shake hands, Jahan clasping Lohse&apos;s hand in both of his.*
*The object repeats its cryptic remarks from earlier, but says nothing more.*
Crown...? Her crown was taken from her long ago, by Braccus - you would know that, if you were who you claim to be! You&apos;re nothing but a common thief!
Notes on Green Tea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fine brew is often known as Soldier&apos;s Sidekick. It has been found to add a real spring in the step of those heading out to battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a cup of the green stuff in your belly, it feels like everything is just easier and quicker than ever before.
*Tell it: really dangerous.*
Bearded Axe
*He looks to you tearfully.*
[SCHOLAR] *Inhale the aroma in the kitchen, and comment that the cook must favour nutmeg.*
*She lowers her eyes, her hands rubbing her neck again.*
*Suggest that maybe the rebels aren&apos;t her only target.*
Locked
*A faint hum moves with the rhythm, low and clear. It sounds like a river; like a whistle; like nothing else.*
*He gives you a look of dark warning and returns to his work.*
Ne&apos;er heard of it. How does&apos;t go?
Off you waddle, dwarf.
*The bard clears his throat as though to continue but suddenly stops short.*
*Turn to Sadha and say you don&apos;t care what&apos;s going on. You love her!*
*She grasps her head as if trying to clear it.*
*Leave it be.*
He who wakes an ancient evil must slay said ancient evil. If that&apos;s not an expression, it should be.
So return to Rivellon and seek out these sages where they dwell. Convince them to share with you their deep-seated bond with the Source.
*It is no longer possible to read the name upon this old grave marker.*
Yow can start with Alexandar&apos;s piglets, they&apos;re down the rise there. And yow can do it now. &lt;i&gt;Move!&lt;/i&gt;
*Play along and say you got off early.*
I&apos;ve always had a soft spot for red meat!
Easier just to kill you now and collect as usual.
*Murmur that no matter the times, some things never change.*
*Ifan freezes, and a cold anger emanates from him. He draws his weapon... then lets it hang by his side as he realises how useless it is against a spirit. Without a flicker of fear on her face, she smirks back at him.*
*You run your finger along the skull and spine until it finds a fissure. Upon closer inspection, you realise the victim suffered a broken neck. It seems this person took a great fall.*
Give me your hands. We need to pray.
System Storage is out of space
*Say you admire him being so down-to-earth about the matter. Somehow you hadn&apos;t expected that from him.*
But you do know her. You see her in your dreams. It is she whom you call the secret of your soul. The mother of dragons; you the father - or so the prophecy says. But the prophecy must never come to pass.
