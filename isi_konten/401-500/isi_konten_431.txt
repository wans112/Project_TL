The Dreamers promised to take her into the sanctuary of dreams, but before following them, she bid me seek shelter here, await your arrival - of which she was certain! - and tell you that she in turn awaits you, together with your offspring!
But beware, Sadha is ultimately dangerous. Not only will she be the mother of dragons, I fear she&apos;s fallen in with an old enemy. &lt;i&gt;Them.&lt;/i&gt;
*He points vaguely northwards, silken robes flapping.*
*Wonder why Braccus Rex punished them so horribly.*
Ask her where the money is! &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;d love to see the murdering little loiterbasket lose her money. &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; MY MONEY. &lt;i&gt;HAHAHA!&lt;/i&gt;
Veeros is the one you want - he&apos;s got a sharp eye and sharper arrows. He&apos;ll turn your foes into pin cushions before they get anywhere near you.
*Promise her the world if she backs you up in the arena.*
The DoctorIsInDoctorIsInDoctorIsIn, he&apos;s in! He has the TrickstheGifts, the HealingWays theDealingWays the D-D-D-DARKways. He gets the barrels. Theduskoilfunky barrels!
Life Channeling Aura
So this is the Divine Order&apos;s death camp... or however they&apos;re calling it.
Stow the elven hedge-magic. Weren&apos;t much use when we flooded your forests with Deathfog, were it?
You&apos;re a true friend, do you know that? And that&apos;s a word that was meaningless to me until our journey began.
I&apos;ll miss you, Lohse. I really will. Goodbye.
[BARBARIAN] *Stiffen your jaw. Glower. Do you seem like the type that enjoys &apos;tricks&apos;?*
Wind Deep Forest 07
Not much to report - but not for lack of trying. Any idea where I can find that Jahan fella  you mentioned?
What is this? Highly unusual, I must saaaaaAAAYYYYY...
*Your fingers meet mucus as they pry beneath the plates. One shifts loose with a hiss, and a putrid mist coats your face.*
*Nod to Fane. Allow him to approach the Voidwoken.*
We have no business together.
You saw me. You touched me. You showed me just how little I knew.
I guess that makes me an idiot.
*Tell her she gets to feel good about herself. Also she may help to save the world.*
Indeed. I can&apos;t say Alexandar is worth mourning. But with him gone, it&apos;s even more vital that Meistr Siva guide you to Divinity.
Reactive Shot
*He stares into your brand new soul and shows his hand - he lets you know that he has something that you seek. Something &lt;i&gt;important.*&lt;/i&gt;
Luck favours the brave. Perhaps he lacked courage.
Yes, I can tell from your vagabond-chic, a-bag-is-as-good-as-a-shirt kind of style, I shouldn&apos;t be getting my hopes up.
Please. A delivery. Surely you have one. &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;.
Pyrokinetic skills are Fire-based spells. High intelligence improves these skills. Read this book to learn this skill.
*Attack her.*
Select the type of clue characters and monsters have in an arena game that shows their alignment towards you. Circle is a coloured circle at their base. Outline is a coloured outline border.
Sight
You know, now that I think about it... Flora was got rid of already, wasn&apos;t she? Who the hell are you then? Buvver off!
We expanded our Source potential. What next?
*Wonderful! Ask if he&apos;s going to be your shield for a change.*
Steeped in water, it makes a highly-prized drink with earthy, calming properties.
You, me, everything we&apos;ve ever done, everyone we&apos;ve ever loved, could be lost to us forever.
These are... *cough!* changing times... or... or whatever.
Before you go... I have something for you. Something I learned. A touch of Void, if you will.
And don&apos;t you mistake my compliment for it either. Halfie.
Escape from Reaper&apos;s Eye
*...yet it is with a heavy heart that you realise this artefact intones the same unrecognisable language as the one you found on Bloodmoon Island.*
Did she regret becoming Divine?
Arena
*Tell him he had a lot of talent for a dog.*
Lohar has had difficulties with his associate Mordus. Maybe we can exploit this.
Nemesis Stargazer
Blessing of Winter
*Even blunted with age, the symbol resembles an arrowhead forged in flame.*
*Lohar sent you here to work. To move supplies to Arx. Heavy lifting, but you needed the pay. A Voidwoken took you. Its children ate you alive. Death was a relief.*
*The lumpen Silent Monk stands like a pillar of decaying flesh, so still it seems he is not even breathing.*
I was a businessman. I can&apos;t say I always kept thing on the up-and-up, but I don&apos;t think a rogue pirate&apos;s got a lot of room to judge a man for his various... trade concerns. And what Justinia&apos;s cookin&apos; up weren&apos;t so good for my bottom line.
See sense, fool. The tortured souls that they&apos;ve turned into weapons will cut you down and leave you to rot in the marsh!
*Ifan strides forwards and confronts the sorrowful spirit of Alexandar.*
The input [1] is currently assigned to [2]. Do you want to remove previous binding(s)?
*Heat envelops you from head to toe as a guttural voice rises. It snuffs out the longing with its first breath.*
*Take pause. Do the torch flames... hurt him?*
Come, there&apos;s no quarrel between us. We can help each other.
The royal guard - they&apos;d sing this while wandering the hinterlands, lookin&apos; for rebels in the shadows. Was some time ago, of course, back when yeh were banished to the Isle of Mists.
They beat all those Voidwoken? I&apos;m impressed.
Thank you, my child. Thank you.
*Note that Lucian&apos;s massacre of the masters and students at the Academy wasn&apos;t really done to aid Alexandar.*
White Magister Hux
Amyro is free.
*Scratch behind the pooch&apos;s ear. He&apos;s not alone for now, at least.*
A war of such devastation, it was never thought possible. A war brought on by your unfathomable stupidity.
That&apos;s three hands to me and...?
It&apos;s the end now. The real end. Now&apos;s the end... the end...
[FANE] *Explain that you were captured while investigating the excavation of some Eternal ruins on Reaper&apos;s Coast.*
Blessed Ice Grenade
* That&apos;s a shame, but not your concern. Shrug your shoulders and take your leave.*
GM Journal
*He&apos;s just about ready to talk, but push a little harder. One can never be too sure.*
Lizard Skeleton
*...but a shadow looms over you. A &lt;i&gt;Paladin&lt;/i&gt;. You smile; you have a story ready for this very situation - yet when you open your mouth, no words spill forth. A blade swings, and your hand hits the ground with a thump.*
Oven
*Tell the crab to watch its tone or it&apos;ll find itself on the wrong end of a spear.*
I do not see this. But I do see...
*He shakes his head and points to your mouth, beckoning for you to open it.*
Order of Society
Time is a river, ever slipping by. It does no good to mourn what&apos;s gone before - only to appreciate where the current carries us.
Not Ready
But if you really want a Sourcerer - go to Bloodmoon Island. And that&apos;s all I have to say about it.
*He gives you an earnest look and shows you towards the kitchen.*
Come find me.
It&apos;s nice to finally come out of my shellllllllllll!
May they be granted the strength to do what must be done.
You two ought to be thankin&apos; yer lucky gods it&apos;s us and not the Magisters enforcin&apos; &apos;round here. A fool never knows what they&apos;ve got &apos;til it&apos;s well and gone.
Good for you. Good for you, cuckoo.
*Sings* Whisht, bonnie bairn, now don&apos;t you cry.
Lohse... the Doctor will see you now. End of the hall.
All for nothing... hehe... nothing but a bloody jest!
The ritual failed for our lack of Source. We should use the fountain in Siva&apos;s cellar, then try again.
Cowl
Well, you&apos;ve heard that the Magisters were colluding with the Black Ring, right?
Maybe, angel eyes.
I&apos;m glad we can continue on together... and I &lt;i&gt;won&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; let you down.
*Stay still and enjoy the warmth of his presence.*
Basic Attack
*&apos;Dallis&apos; and her &apos;Sourcerer&apos; mock-fight in the dust.*
I intended to spend a night of passion with the Red Prince, but when it became quite clear his one true love is Sadha, I urged him to stay loyal to her and he acquiesced.
Ring Boots
Lagan
With his name we may undo him. That will be our attempt.
Use the [LeftStick] to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;move&lt;/font&gt; the object. Press [IE_Interact] to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/font&gt; it. You can rotate the item with [IE_PrevObject] and [IE_NextObject].
[SOLDIER] *Tell him his trade will be gone if the Magisters requisition his stock. Ask if he&apos;d like that to happen.*
Clear current offer
*A wave of sadness rolls off the spirit, sadness mixed with... betrayal. The Magister was stabbed in the back, by one they&apos;d known as a friend.*
We are battling for our very survival. And we are losing. Should we truly perish, &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; will be cast into oblivion.
*Tell him to shut up and deal.*
Malady
For aeons she would walk in the world,
We fed the spider. It told us that Ryker is beholden to a &apos;promise&apos;, and isn&apos;t happy about it. More flesh might earn more information.
I...
[BEAST] *Bare your teeth in an ugly grin and tell him you like his toothpicks.*
not as a rebel, but as a lawmaker.
[LOHSE] *Clap your hands together enthusiastically. Time to give that thing what&apos;s coming to it.*
Hurry it up, Sourcerer. I don&apos;t have all day.
*It gasps in the air, struggling for the breath to speak. Its own blood froths at its mouth.*
You have been told. She agreed to a contract. Signed the page. Shook the hand. And now she wants out.
You do not pay for your crimes in bribes. You pay in blood!
*Observe that it&apos;s news to you that even gods can be stillborn - if a goddess she is.*
Totem Armour Destruction
Lava Eruption
I probably shouldn&apos;t have mentioned that. It all just seems so pointless.
*Malady doesn&apos;t meet your eyes. Her arms are folded across her chest, but her eyes blaze.*
*Stare him down wordlessly.*
Now then. On a more serious note. How about a kiss?
If only. Alas, I do not have the time for isolation.
I&apos;m a wealthy man, as you noticed, and wealthy men need protection, especially if they &lt;i&gt;accompany&lt;/i&gt; their wealth.
A stately knight. I feel safer in his presence.
*Wonder if there is not a grain of truth in there somewhere.*
We found Sanguinia Tell&apos;s debtors&apos; vials.
Daeyena, what is happening?!
Inside Dark
Perhaps we will meet again in the Hall of Echoes some day, hmm?
Mmmm. There&apos;s potential here I think. But how very timid you are. I had quite expected more... zest from you.
Wait a minute. This is all just a little too convenient. I&apos;m betting &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; the reason these Voidwoken&apos;re here at all. &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer!&lt;/i&gt;
Black Ring. Could they be doing the purging?
Wooden Pitchfork
*Say you heard the accommodation was exceptional and had to see for yourself.*
Hurry. Please.
&lt;i&gt;Marcus Miles bastard born, the mannered life enraged him.&lt;br&gt;A gnashing varmint he became, so queen sought then to cage him.&lt;/i&gt;
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Here we are. Tread carefully, Lohse. This place... it isn&apos;t safe.
*Punch him in the face.*
*Tell him to trust you - this is hardly the strangest thing to happen these days.*
*Try as he might, Tarquin cannot hide a small flash of surprise.*
You men! Stand by your master! This ruffian has come to rob me!
He&apos;s a man of many talents, not the least of which is... &lt;i&gt;knowing. &lt;/i&gt;Arhu spots details that elude even the savviest of spies. If the Hammer has fallen in Arx, he&apos;ll have taken notice.
You healed another? I wish you&apos;d come sooner!
I might be lonely, but I&apos;d prefer to be alone than chitter-chatter with the likes of you. So, you want to cross, or what?
*No. This isn&apos;t right. You remember what is was like being under the Mother&apos;s spell. Only with the Mother dead, will the elves be free.*
Obedient Protector
