Hello, dear prince. Hello, betrayed soul. How sad to stand accused. To be innocent but... not believed.
It does not matter. My spores go, and so I follow. Wherever the armour leads.
Good luck out there. Might be we&apos;ll see each other further down the road...
Good wishes, friend.

Gecko
You&apos;re so cool! I&apos;ve never met a lizard before. Can I touch your scales?
Equals
Then learn to be. It&apos;s quite easy, and ever so advantageous.
*You don&apos;t care about gold or favours. Ask what else he has to offer.*
Right, then. Let&apos;s see what I find.
Network initialisation failed
[NOBLE] *Say that the only sound you want to hear from a crab is its sizzling flesh, served with butter and capers.*
*The girl stares blankly at the space in front of her. She doesn&apos;t seem to see you, hear you, or be aware of anything outside of her own head.*
Automaton - Any
Here&apos;s hoping. But I haven&apos;t seen anything to contradict the spirit of mine. &lt;i&gt;Yet.&lt;/i&gt;
What is it?
Female
As for her neck, she&apos;s remembering the damnable Source collar she once wore.
Blood Infusion
There&apos;s likely not a soul aboard this ship without secrets they&apos;d rather keep hidden. Why should I face more scrutiny than the rest?
*Ask what it means to her, this sudden revelation of her importance.*
Speak with Lord Arhu.
Shipwreck’s Manifesto
*Ask what your feedback is worth to him.*
*He lines up another nail and hammers it into the panel.*
So. Here goes.
The Red Prince claims Divinity and will oppose me in combat. I should probably have seen this coming.
[BARBARIAN] *You&apos;ve survived tougher places than this. You&apos;re sure they&apos;ll be fine.*
High wits allows for detection of the extraordinary
Oh, don&apos;t be coy. We&apos;re not strangers, you and I. There&apos;s no-one in this world I know better than you. You are the secret of my soul, just like I am yours.
Please do.
This carved rune glows and thrums with power.
*Ask Sebille what our next move should be.*
You&apos;ve &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;unlocked&lt;/font&gt; a new room at your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Homestead&lt;/font&gt;.
You&apos;re not going to walk away, are you? Are you?!
Mordus. The priest. Not... what he claims to be.
So this was the final dream? How strange. It felt like all the rest.
Something&apos;s wrong. *Sniff.* Something&apos;s wrong and it&apos;s not right.
Frozen status and water damage is ignored.
*Shrug. It is what it is. No point getting jittery about it.*
[UNDEAD] *Tell him you served in a war nobody remembers.*
Options
Do. He must not escape! I&apos;ll have no more Magister blood on my hands...
My word! Warms the heart and everything else besides!
Ah, well. Me best mate&apos;s son is undead. Nothin&apos; to be ashamed of!
*Tell him you&apos;ll give him another chance. &apos;Better a bad barber than a bloody butcher.&apos;*
*Say you don&apos;t believe in far-seeing.*
*Draw your weapon. You know where this is headed.*
Ah, you help him. Your open heart surprises even me.
*...then suddenly vanishes. Now you smell only the faint scent of wood and a cold, metallic tang, as yet unfamiliar.*
&lt;b&gt;ENOUGH! You will not take her from us!&lt;/b&gt;
Source weapons? No wonder the Void is getting stronger in Driftwood!
He already knew about the veil, Fane. He was draining its power - leaching from it to build up his own strength.
*Sigh and demand clarity. What &lt;i&gt;Change?*&lt;/i&gt;
Hmmm?
That&apos;s pretty awesome, if you ask me! With all this Deathfog floating around, that troll might end up being the last living creature out here!
That lady... Lohse...? She&apos;s not a real person. She has a &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;... wearing her skin. I saw it.
*Ask him what he makes of the new state of the world.*
*Unscrew the top of the healing potion Mody gave to you, hold his head with your hand, and tilt its contents into his mouth.*
[RED PRINCE] *Say he doesn&apos;t impress you: you&apos;ve seen worse done to runaway slaves.*
Almira left in search of the tablet.
So, the Red Prince is here. &lt;i&gt;Interesting. &lt;/i&gt;If revolting...
*Take your leave.*
[IFAN] *Tell him that divinity already caused the deaths of those you held dear and destroyed the world they lived in.*
*The cat&apos;s eyes are clouded and grey, but it stares at you with acute intensity.*
Glare
*Point out that &apos;my family&apos; came rather low in his list.*
Jump over the enemy, landing behind their back and backstabbing them for [1].
M&apos;lord, I beg your pardon, but the feast has been cut short, due to, er, act of Gods.
After killing an enemy, your maximum vitality is increased.
Friend. What do you need?
*Consume its Source - for its benefit &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; yours.*
Good find!
Lizard&apos;s Bow
*You punch the ground over and over, your fists bloodied by the gravel they strike.*
*It can&apos;t be more dangerous than the island - it&apos;s been overrun by the Black Ring!*
Gods&apos; teeth, it feels good to move again. Now, best scurry off before that Magister wanders back. Meet me at my home in Driftwood, and we can see what you&apos;re made of.
The lifeless, worm-like tail is stiff and hard. The animal&apos;s spirit has long fled this world.
So I find out. On my own, away from the storm that surely comes. The God King is defeated - but the door to the Void is open, left there by the man I once thought would be Divine.
One eye is sun; one eye is moon. I wonder which half of her nature she yearns will prevail.
If whatever it is sticks to killing demons, you won&apos;t get any argument from me.
Huh? What&apos;re ya doin&apos; here? Thought Griff had you makin&apos; the rounds inside.
Divinity is not for you to take. It never was.
*Explain that some actions are moral or immoral; others are not easily defined.*
People like Kemm, they just get richer and richer, while the rest of us scramble for their scraps. Cat says we deserve better... and I believe her.
*Ask her to tell you once more what you must do.*
*The spirit gasps as you drain every drop of his lifeblood, his legacy reduced to a final, shivering form.*
Speak to Malady in Arx.
Lingering Wounds
*Shrug. You&apos;ll get to it in time.*
King of kings, god of gods: I told you that&apos;s how it would be.
*Walk away.*
Have you seen my beloved?
*Ask if you can help somehow.*
The Nameless Isle awaits. The Great Mother calls you with every breath of wind that rustles through her leaves.
Griff
Nipnip. Eeeeep!
Harbour Key
Get out of here now before I tell Lohar you&apos;ve been wandering around upsetting the fish-cart. See if your money&apos;s any good to you &lt;i&gt;then.&lt;/i&gt; Good day to you.
*Ask her if she&apos;s aware that her husband invited Arhu to their home not too long ago.*
Go to war for the Wellspring.
*Nod and hold it out in front of her.*
Just as I suspected! A well-developed constitution and a strong sense of charm. Well done; your skills will stand you in good stead, I&apos;m sure.
*Smile. Smile wider.*
*Shake your head. You have no idea what comes next.*
We can&apos;t just leave &apos;em to die! You’re gonna help, aren’t you?
[1] [2] xp
*Whisper that you know he can&apos;t get rid of her father alone.*
Be careful!
Takes one to know one, mate.
Ryker languished in his graveyard mansion.
&lt;i&gt;Ahahahahaha! &lt;/i&gt;Keep it up, puny fleshbag! Your blows mean nothing to me...
Repairing succeeded!
Summon Spiky Trunk
Tornado Scroll
*Everything goes dark. You see nothing. You know nothing.*
*She goes very still indeed. From the corner of your eye you see her hand move towards her weapon.*
Already knew that, didn&apos;t I. Glad to hear he&apos;s dead and gone, at least. Thank the gods. You don&apos;t know what world of good you&apos;ve done.
Ben. If he finds his mum in Fort Joy they&apos;re probably both really happy now. So don&apos;t worry. Isn&apos;t that right, lizard?
*Bishop Alexandar idly glances in your direction, curiosity on his face. Recognition seems to flicker in his eyes for a moment, but then he shakes his head and looks back towards Dallis.*
Connor the Brave
*Say that the eagle looks more hungry than dutiful.*
*Feel the anger, let it consume you.*
No...
The Magisters are gone, thank the Gods. But it&apos;s never really over, is it?
Tangled Vine
After all we do. After all this. She is gone...
Voidwoken Spike
By Lucian&apos;s blade, we shall prevail...
Did you know our arena champion&apos;s a bloody cheat, stranger? Murga tripped me and bit off my earlobe before the fight &apos;ad even started!
*The jar before you may have looked opulent once, but no longer. Now it&apos;s covered in grime, its paint chipped away, and its jewels long stolen.*
So much for &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;lead.
&lt;i&gt;N&apos;aromud awen. Sh&apos;salvinou yona vayiti v&apos;damriti, Ravie. Ruvola de&apos;tay!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ll find a way to help with Adramahlihk, Lohse. He&apos;s getting stronger.
&lt;b&gt;Roll-call of Fallen Seekers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May their names be hallowed in the Hall of Echoes long after our memory of them has faded on this earthly plane:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Elder Spy&lt;br&gt;Korgh&lt;br&gt;Cosmin Sufaru&lt;br&gt;Baron Judas&lt;br&gt;Moorkh&lt;br&gt;Stormwarden Wind&lt;br&gt;Hiker&lt;br&gt;Anu Blake&lt;br&gt;Anja&lt;br&gt;Wisdom&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;May they yet find what they seek.&lt;/i&gt;
You could have put up with my &apos;palavering&apos; in exchange for my having to put up with you!
Still much to do, though. Still much to do, even when you find yourself... like &lt;i&gt;this.&lt;/i&gt;
Well, I guess when you put it that way... alright. Off with you. Just stay out of trouble.
Necklaces
You are already formidable, Ifan, but you underestimate just how much more formidable you could be!
Make Peace
Donate items to anybody to increase their &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Attitude&lt;/font&gt;. This might be helpful if people refuse to engage in a conversation with you.
What, you think I&apos;m being... &lt;i&gt;lazy?!&lt;/i&gt; No - this is sheer pragmatism. I already tried to retrieve the item, but I don&apos;t have the, eh... necessary skills...
I&apos;m listening.
But if you find out who did it... shake their hand for me.
Forged with passion and tempered with precision, what happens to this sword next is up to you.
&lt;i&gt;Voidkin!&lt;/i&gt; You&apos;ll not add to your collection on my watch!
These White Magisters are rotting from the head. &lt;i&gt;Dallis.&lt;/i&gt;
... right! Ah, thank the gods. Thank &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
The Sallow Man is dead, but it seems unlikely that we have seen the last of the Void&apos;s followers.
&apos;Hostile threat detected. Executing operator extirpation in three...&apos;
*The burly dwarf is distracted by his own facial hair. He thrusts two fingers into it repeatedly until he extracts the final prize: an errant fly. He flicks into the air and it buzzes off, just in time for him to notice your presence.*
*Wait for Isbeil to continue. Your ego revels in the flattery.*
*The queen bids you rise with an upwards flick of her hand.*
She got us where we needed to go, even if she was quite unpleasant to be around.
Escape on Alexandar&apos;s ship.
My thanks for your help. Please, report to Magister Carver at the barracks, beside the Tavern. He&apos;ll want to hear there are still brave souls in this town.
*Grip the spirit&apos;s hand as his eyeballs begin to melt.*
*Tell him you need to stop and rest. You have goods to trade: weapons, food, and more.*
It&apos;s a good thing Leya is safe back at the cave... seeing all the dead Seekers like this... it could break her.
Charlie said that the smelly man seemed to be concealing the smell of rot with the scent of flowers. She also noted that his smell reminded her of her friend, Louie.
*Apologise, explaining that you must have misplaced your manners somewhere on the long road to Driftwood.*
Menacing Bodyguard
Search for the corpse-explosion skillbook.
Lucky ain&apos;t the word I&apos;d use. Nor&apos;s patient, so go and loom somewhere else, elf. I&apos;ve enough to do without picking your leaves off the catch.
*Take a step ahead. You won&apos;t be intimidated by some mutt.*
