You there, kinswoman. A word!
*You wonder briefly about the prospects of an undeath lived beneath the sea, then clench your eyes and brace for impact.*
Lohar? Sorry - not familiar. I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ve mistaken me for someone else. Now, I&apos;m sure you&apos;re a busy lad, so you should... be somewhere else.
A vial of blood that looks... terrifyingly familiar
*Respond with gratitude. The prayer will inspire and strengthen you.*
*Inform her she was under Mordus&apos; control. Lucky for her, you killed him.*
*Indicate the Magister. One of the thieves she hunts?*

I don&apos;t fear dogs.
On Sulfurium
Gareth disavowed us. We parted ways.

*She spits at you once more. But she&apos;s powerless, and she knows it. You &lt;i&gt;both &lt;/i&gt;know it.*
Murga&apos;s no longer... with us. I&apos;ll miss the girl. Her soul burned with fire, it did.
I can&apos;t believe I let that happen.
What? A ghoul? No, of course not -
I- I- they&apos;re going to the Black House in Arx. I ain&apos;t got the buyer&apos;s name - not even sure he &lt;i&gt;has &lt;/i&gt;a name!
*The button slowly sinks into the wall, as if pushed by an invisible hand.*

With her help, we&apos;ve saved countless children from Dallis and Alexandar. And we aim to save many more.
*Thank the bull for giving you directions and take your leave.*
Cluck cluck! Bock!

*Ask the troll to stop.*
A very large-sized potion capable of steeling you against the effects of air magic.

*Inform them of Hannag&apos;s fate. She no longer lives.*
Several Magisters have disappeared from Driftwood. Foul play is suspected.
*You hear nothing but the slow, hard beating of your heart.*
We need to weaken your demon by freeing the souls he&apos;s trapped here. Exactly how he&apos;s storing them - and what that will mean for us - will be a surprise for both of us.
Sebille
*Ask what he meant when he said Trompdoy was kept here by Braccus Rex.*
*Growls...* &lt;i&gt;&apos;kay, yezz.&lt;/i&gt;
It isn&apos;t fair. It isn&apos;t fair!
But I know we can&apos;t stay here. The Magisters... they&apos;ll come back. They always do.
The fate of our realm hangs in the balance. If you will not help us save it, then you will help the Void destroy it.
Go on - she&apos;s all yours!

*The unlit candle nearby flickers briefly to life. The spirit shakes his head and gives you a dismissive wave.*
Your kind has been dismembering and burning mine since time immemorial. I must admit, the smell of charred human flesh is so &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;enticing.
Question the prisoners.
*Ifan scowls and turns away from you, muttering something unsavoury under his breath.*
Regardless of who&apos;s on the island, all that matters is who ascends. &lt;i&gt;Make sure that&apos;s you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Reply that you&apos;d like to fight in the arena.*
*She crawls across the space between you and climbs into your lap, wrapping her legs around you.*

Named &apos; The Great Schism of the Divine Order and the Ruination of Arx&apos; - this valuable painting was crafted entirely using just one hue of crimson: blood.
My... you never cease to impress, do you?
We convinced Cottontail that her master prefers Dot.
Show respect, stranger, to the next Divine, or we&apos;ll cut respect into yer. I&apos;ll carve Alexandar&apos;s name into your eyeball, if I hafta.
I too had the pleasure.
Clearly a man of wisdom and piety. Humility, not so much.

There, it is done. But please, tell me, do you have the Soul Jars?
If you die you ssserve the King, but Sssallow, he wants Alexsssander dead, so you mussst ssstay alive a little longer.
We intervened in an execution at the barracks. To save the prisoner we had to kill the Paladins.

Alien Water Essence
*Mutter that you don&apos;t care whether Alexandar&apos;s dead or alive. You just hope you won&apos;t ever see his face again.*
*Ask what&apos;s going on in Arx that they aren&apos;t allowed entry.*
[SCHOLAR] *Say that you value knowledge above all else... and in that vein, you&apos;ve read that his Lady Luck is no more than a demon in disguise.*

*Say you&apos;re not interested in its metaphors. You want it to leave you alone, forever. &lt;i&gt;Now.*&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s a quandary, you see. I tried. I really did. But the servants that tend the graves, well... their master isn&apos;t so keen on me. He caught me nosing around, and had those masked freaks chase me off.
