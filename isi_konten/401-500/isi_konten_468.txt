A Godwoken...? I thank you - death was the only remedy for what was done to me...
But... but then who will protect Peeper? Who will care for him?
The brooding gaze of a bearded man sears into your mind. Investigation of the plaque beneath shows this to be an artist&apos;s interpretation of Rhalic, one of the Seven.
We find ourselves at odds, that much cannot be denied. All because of who you are, and all because of who &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; is.
I am consort to Her Royal Highness Justinia. It is my business to know who serves the queen&apos;s allies and abets her enemies. You do not roam this land unnoticed.
*You start to speak, but it&apos;s too late. Tir-Cendelius breaks free, and the voice that emerges from your mouth is not quite your own.*
Old Black Wolf
*Stow your weapons and say there will be no further bloodshed here today.*
Sets Hasted
Please. Go. Do not return. Or you regret it.
That&apos;s your lot. Go on then. Get lost, ya freeloader. I&apos;m workin&apos; here.
*Lick his face.*
I suppose we all see what we want to see. When I look in the mirror, I see balance. Balance between darkness and light. Between good and evil - whatever those categories mean.
Death Fire
What monster is this?!
And now here &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are... like moths to a flame, not understanding that the fire will consume us.
*You draw closer and close your eyes, eager to feel her lips on yours...*
*She listens. Matches your breathing. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Her breathing returns to normal and the panic dissolves.*
*Say she needs to stay strong and be tough.*
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? A toddler with a beard?
*The skeleton breaks off mid-sentence as he notices your hand. He pulls out a notebook, flicking through it, running a finger down the pages.*
*Ask who this master is, and where they came from.*
Your treachery gave them a weapon. Your knowledge let them tear our people apart. It let them cast us into the Void.
Yesss... Do fight. Do put up a struggle. The fun ones always do.
Ugh, look at you. Tell me, do you always slink around with the air of a child caught drawing naughty pictures in church? What are you so afraid of, lad? Daddy&apos;s belt? Or is it it Daddy&apos;s -
Fear not, Quercus. I &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;discover how to stop the Great Acorn. I will protect the creatures of this land - &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of them - from the Knights.
The more dead allies, the stronger you become.
Squash the vermin. Hang the thieves.
They... were stolen! The babies! The eggs! Something... something TOOK them!
*Peace, true peace. There has never been a moment such as this: the cuddling after, in this little satin nest.*
*Look at the skeleton in confusion. Braccus has been dead for centuries...*
Destroy [1] on target character. Set status that halves resistances.
Leave me alone. Stay away from me!
*You&apos;re not sure you feel comfortable with this...*
Bandit Sourcerer
Ma&apos;am, yes ma&apos;am!
Hah! How funny that you&apos;d think I&apos;d answer to a lizard&apos;s pet. That&apos;s what your scar means, doesn&apos;t it? You do tricks on command and sleep in a kennel, isn&apos;t that right?
[SOLDIER] *Tell him that when you&apos;re on the side of right, there&apos;s no reason to hide.*
Sunkissed Brown
Aye, she needs help, but none that I can give. Mad as cuckoo, that one, and twice as loud.
*About her special herb mixes...*
If I didn&apos;t know better, I&apos;d have thought she had a demon in her head, too. Well, I guess she did, in a way. And it got the better of her...
Immolation
You creatures with your legs and arms and your opposable thumbs, you always want&apos;a steer the ship. You need&apos;a trust the ship. It dances to the tune. It knows what it&apos;s doing.
We destroyed the pillars and freed the possessed dwarf. He attacked us.
Get in my way and you&apos;ll get an elbow in the eye.
Pretty Shoes
*Tell him you want the bloody magic word and you want it now.*
*No! Absolutely not - how dare he?*
A Source-hungry undead set free from his bonds. What could go wrong?
*Say that, in that case, you are glad to have been of service.*
Whoah...

&apos;CLOSED INDEFINITELY!&apos;
In need of something, traveller? If the harbour&apos;s anything to go by, you &lt;i&gt;don&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;want to venture out unprepared.
You&apos;re about to make me &lt;i&gt;very very&lt;/i&gt; rich, little mouse. Richer even than butchered old Baran whose dead appearance I&apos;m keeping alive.
*Once, this was an alchemist&apos;s shop. Or an occultist&apos;s. Or a physician&apos;s.*
*She looks down at her feet. Seeing her blood-spattered wedding slippers, her face crumples and tears spring from her eyes.*
The door to the Doctor&apos;s house won&apos;t let us in without an appointment.
*Tell him he&apos;s a fool. Power is nothing without freedom.*
Oh no, no, no, that won&apos;t do at all. &lt;i&gt;Innocence&lt;/i&gt; is a mask that doesn&apos;t fit you.
Attributes
&apos;Death Room&apos;, eh? Charming.
I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;busy&lt;/i&gt;.
The Covenant. It sounds - sounded - so beautiful. Eternity, right there at my fingertips. Yet it&apos;s all a lie. There is no grand reward, no enduring prosperity. Just slavery within the Void. The rule of a hellish hand.
*Unsheathe your weapon. You&apos;ve been itching for a fight all day.*
Got me. Meistr Siva&apos;s dead - but I doubt that whatever guidance she had for us died with her. So we poke, we prod, we fiddle, and we fake it. Always worked for me, anyway.
The skeletal arm we discovered stopped moving after we shattered the Captain&apos;s Soul Jar.
Makes distant things more blurry. Disable this if you don&apos;t like the effect. Disabling this does not yield a whole lot of a performance boost.
Spirit of a Child
Medusa Head
*Squint and notice a button you hadn&apos;t seen before. Press its worn surface.*
My... my face is warm. Haha! And my stomach, too...? I&apos;m glad you&apos;re here.
Boils my blood. They sign to serve their Divine, they get their robes and their insignia...
Hang on. Important thinkin&apos; happening here!
We are abominations.
&lt;i&gt;*Boy?&lt;/i&gt; Tell him he ought to think twice before addressing you like a child.*
*You haven&apos;t, but tell her that you&apos;re still looking.*

I tell you I am no witch. The spores do this. If I do not find the rest -
I just made the device the Divine himself ordered. But as for &lt;i&gt;using&lt;/i&gt; it, that was all Lucian and Alexandar. I was there... Lucian knew &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;what he was doing.
Time to go?
*Put an end to this: consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Heals allies or smashes skulls, depending on the direction of the winds
...&lt;i&gt;the Doctor!&lt;/i&gt; That monster, he must have done this to me. He must die. The world will be a better place without him.
*Give her a stern look... then smile. Hook a finger towards her: &apos;Come here.&apos;*
Erratic Wisp
The Void is open and the ancients rise. The sky, the water, the land - all of it diseased, like rotting cattle flesh. And you dare wonder &lt;i&gt;why I am angry.&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit&apos;s expression of composure slips - this time her shock is genuine. A moment later, she is gone.*
*Hold your breath and will your heart to stop beating, lest you miss a word.*
&lt;i&gt;Yezzz. &lt;/i&gt;I&apos;m hungry, gonna find food.
I don&apos;t care how many Voidwoken you&apos;ve slain - you&apos;d better explain what&apos;s going on or you&apos;re going to the cells.
*A prince of the House of War; the den of slavers! You ache to kill...*
This? This is the home of Rhalic on earth. You would be wise to bow your head in his honour, manchild of Rhalic, as cubs bow before the alpha wolf.
It began when I woke in the dark room. He removed my blindfold, and still I did not see. He himself was darker than any shadow. But I could hear him: hear him give orders to another.
Why don&apos;t you join us in a round of cards? First hand&apos;s on the house.

Freedom? But I- I&apos;m not ready. No, you can&apos;t- NO!!!
There is hope, kin. The Scion Sebille shall save us all. She will be the new Mother.
This little signet ring is so hypnotising, you suddenly feel like you&apos;d do almost anything for it...
*He squeals in delight.*
*Ask where the spirit was digging.*
Ew! You stink!
*Ask her why the long face.*
To erase the past I must do just that: &lt;i&gt;erase&lt;/i&gt; it.
...ambition is all, a life of few surprises.
Confessing to murder, the Sourcerer Windego implied that we had something in common with her victim. She triggered an explosion and escaped.
*She looks at you with a dull expression, then to the blood at her translucent feet.*
No deal, I&apos;m afraid.
As s-soon as the Magister fell, Gwyd knew what he&apos;d done. He didn&apos;t even struggle when they dragged him away. Gods know where they took him.
Double Headed Hammer
Deal with the creature.
*Roost is the leader&apos;s name. He boasts of how he caught you in his snares, and delivered you to the Master.*
It only begins. The presence within grows. To complete the armour...
&apos;Worthy&apos; is exactly the right word. Someone who&apos;s proven themselves might earn my time o&apos; day. Speakin&apos; of, you haven&apos;t. So buy or shove off.

*Change the subject.*
*Tell him he is quickly losing your fealty if you are indeed what he says.*
*The spirit unsheathes his ghostly sword and brandishes it at &lt;i&gt;something &lt;/i&gt;in the water.*

Draught of Wits
My brothers tell me they&apos;ve uncovered the Sourcerer. Worse, they&apos;ve discovered that he has a bomb!
[DWARF] *Tell her not to worry; she&apos;s a fine warmaiden and any warmother would be proud of her survival.*
It is the voice of the trees. It will remain with you, now. I hear it, too - beautiful and strong. Yours will grow, if you let it. It will shrink, if you do not.
Soon, I&apos;d like to have a little chat about something &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;can do for &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
[SCHOLAR] *Note that his spirit appears in skeletal form. Applying the principle &apos;in death as in life&apos;, deduce that Kemm was secretly undead.*
I give you something. A thanks.
*The bottle swishes in circles as it spins; Lohse watches intently as it lands pointing directly at... yourself.*
We arrived on the Nameless Isle no closer to figuring out how to stop Operation Downfall.
*Tell it you&apos;re in charge. Tell it this is &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;body.*
*Tell her you&apos;re worried about the trolls - aren&apos;t they dangerous?*
Let&apos;s play!
*Proclaim that you can help the Paladins. Windego&apos;s talents are no match for your own.*

Right.
I am a &lt;i&gt;rare trophy animal&lt;/i&gt;, you savage! I am not to be eaten!
C-C-Captain? Is that you? Where is everybody?
*Tell them that where you come from you&apos;re known for your beauty.*
I think... I think that&apos;s enough talk for now.
No, you&apos;re here to be collared and shipped like a beast in a cage. Any other pile of bones and they&apos;d  suspect, but you? Not even your yowl gives you away.
*Announce that you&apos;ve come to stop Operation Downfall.*
*Tell her Lord Kemm&apos;s actions concern everyone. Ask her to point you towards her husband&apos;s vault.*
