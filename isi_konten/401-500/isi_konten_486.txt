...I&apos;m lying! You&apos;ve no idea how good that feels! And that&apos;s the truth. It&apos;s not a lie! Because I can tell both the truth &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;a lie. Oh. I see you&apos;re confused. I guess you missed the fun.
*Strictly remind him who he&apos;s talking to. Show some manners, kinsman!*
Never gave up an object of power so fast in my life.
Yum! That&apos;ll take a minute to kick in.
Now all you got to do is suckle the right mouthpiece, and before you know it you&apos;ll be seeing flying tigers just like ol&apos; Ghangha over there.

The Lady Vengeance now had the Seekers for crew, and a new captain too: &lt;i&gt;Malady.&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s time for this disgusting display of gluttony to end. I should have ended it when I had the chance.
*He follows up his greeting with an insincere smile and an upraised eyebrow.*
*She ROARS in defiant rage - you shall not take her, she belongs to the God King, and you shall not - *
Reckon you&apos;ve got a job to do, ain&apos;t ya, lizard.
*Ryker grins at you and his voice grows even louder, until his words echo from every crevasse in the chamber.*
*Tell Beast you are sorry things didn&apos;t go as planned at the Academy. He would - and will - make an excellent Divine.*
*You wonder if even Divinity will save you. Look at him! He&apos;s a defeated god.*
*Tell her to snuff out the candle. If this can save her, it has to be done.*
*...a you with greater insight into the hidden world, a mystic now, your mind wide open. But then the Sallow Man&apos;s grin becomes a snarl, and his outreached hand grasps at you, grabs hold of a part of you, and &lt;i&gt;pulls...*&lt;/i&gt;
*Leave your hand and endure the creature&apos;s profane touch.*
*Tell Malady you have bad news: Meistr Siva has died.*
Shackles Of Pain
[JESTER] *Say you can&apos;t help her, but hope she has a crate day.*
Don&apos;t say that, missus! Don&apos;t say that! I&apos;m too young to be without my mum! What&apos;ll I do?!
Right. I&apos;ll be doing the same.
He helped entertain murderers and tyrants. He&apos;ll find no forgiveness from me.
Vengeance
*Say you like the way he takes care of business.*
Fair travels, friend.
*He gives you a blank look. Then he raises his hands as if holding a crossbow... points it at you... and pulls the trigger. A mirthless smile spreads across his face, but it does not reach his eyes.*
Godwoken.
*Tell him this enemy seems to have incapacitated him along with the others.*
*Say you do. A few, anyway.*
*Fire engulfs you. You &lt;i&gt;burn&lt;/i&gt; you &lt;i&gt;burn&lt;/i&gt; you &lt;i&gt;burn! &lt;/i&gt;Then, just like that, the vision fades. You don&apos;t burn, but an uncanny heat remains.*
No such thing as luck: only self-earned success. Or, as in this case, self-earned failure.
Scratch Pole
Hedgehog
There was no light in that glint. It was the darkness of the Void; the wet darkness of spilt blood.
Leave me be. I don&apos;t have... &lt;i&gt;nnggh&lt;/i&gt;... energy for conversation.
*She smiles weakly.*
*A war owl swoops down from the sky and delivers a message for the Red Prince:*
*Leaning in once more with a triumphant smile, the Red Prince kisses you passionately.*
Find Stingtail.
Battle in the Shallows
My pleasure, love! Hope you have a good time with the freak-folk in there!
Spirit of Tovah
*She gestures to where a young Magister is propped up on a cot in the corner. He&apos;s ashen and dazed, his shoulder bound in layers of crimson-soaked wound dressings.*
But each to... their own, I say... we&apos;re all odd in... our own ways.
There are too few of us. Elf-kind finds value in flesh, where memory lingers. I collect memories, yes - but am more keen on bark and leaf. On the living breeze, not the sleeping past.
Alright, then. Off with you, now, before I change my mind.
Summon Inner Demon
*Verdas? You heard that name in Fort Joy...*
Go to the Council of Seven.
Aye, we&apos;re together. From today &apos;til eternity.
The scar on your face says different.
*Disagree. Her business is her own.*
We chose what was right. I pray you do the same.
*Say you stand quite flabbergasted! Not every day you learn you&apos;ve been hunted all your life!*
Whatever you do, sister, don&apos;t lay your body to rest in this boneyard.
Hope ya rummage up the coin. Pretty sweet to hear someone chant a poem fer ya.
...who&apos;re you, again?
*The dog&apos;s tail wags frantically.*
*He leans in with a smile, his lips meeting yours.*
Let me ask you a question if I may. A query that involves the very fundamentals of who we are.
Thank you. By Lucian, seven times divine, thank you!
Get that artefact, and you and I are as good as free. Go give those overgrown lizards what-for!
*Tell her half the truth. Say you met Zorl-Stissa, god of the lizards, and she called you her champion. Leave off the part where she told you to get rid of Lohse.*
*Stall for time. Maybe he&apos;s just not asking the right questions.*
Big job. I&apos;d offer to help, but I&apos;ve got some business of my &lt;i&gt;own &lt;/i&gt;to attend to.
*The rage grows, burning hotter than the volcano itself, tearing at you, seeking to overpower your senses. The red mist wants to descend. The red mist feels like it does not belong to you. The red mist feels... alive.*
You are Godwoken. You must shield the innocent from death. The Shadow Prince is on this island, seeking our annihilation.
The court tried t&apos;tame yeh, but you were a beast even then. A shame it had to go the way it did. Justinia, she always seemed t&apos;have your back. And then they tossed her the crown...
Attaboy. Come back to me when she&apos;s tree food.
Game Center
*Reach out and touch the plant.*
Aye, it wouldn&apos;t surprise me. He&apos;s Godwoken, a new Divine in the makin&apos; - one of the few that&apos;s left. If this whole thing hadn&apos;t gone south, might be we could&apos;ve saved him.
*Within the shimmer of their changing form, the familiar lines of your own face take shape.*
Hold [IE_PanelSelect] to open the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;panel selection radial&lt;/font&gt;. Then, point [LeftStick] in the direction of the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;inventory panel&lt;/font&gt; to open it.
Sounds like a demon with a swollen tongue. Wonder if what&apos;s inside is as pleasant as a demon with a swollen tongue.
Pickpocket Failed!
...they were consumed by cursed flames.
*The dog focuses at the cat at your feet, baring its teeth and growling.*
The Doctor&apos;s Prison Key
*Tell him no deal. He&apos;s proven himself dishonest.*
But - she&apos;s really nice - and tall! Kind of! Maybe she can even help you with that thing...
*Decide to pick your battles, and stand down.*
Come meet me, Kindler; Shaper; Father.
I have plans for you, child. Rise!
*Ignoring the look in his eyes, effusively thank Ifan for his help on behalf of the Eternals.*
Are you a wizard too?

Clear
Don&apos;t panic, but I think we&apos;ve found our Sourcerer.
Impressive! A barrel-filling machine for the oil, I believe.

Let the torture end...
Distinctive Tea
Oh my sweet, how could I say no?
*Get him!*

*The spirit cowers before you, muttering under his breath.*
*Wonder who would buy such foul-looking fish.*
*Tell them you want to help Gareth. He needs to know what happened.*
I&apos;d swap you if I could.
*There&apos;s a Lone Wolf to be found around here! On the other side of Fort Joy&apos;s walls...*
It must&apos;ve belonged to one of their missing friends. They nearly lynched me then and there. They wouldn&apos;t listen when I tried to tell them that I got it from the cook.
Well, I&apos;m past caring. The world&apos;s about to end. Who&apos;s got the time for dainty manners and etiquette?
You know what they say: the Void finds work for idle hands.

It may be hard to imagine, but each candle is a person. Destroying these lights would mean destroying them all - for good.
*Tell them you&apos;ve dealt with the Voidwoken. They can return home.*
Yeesh. Am I supposed to be grateful for this? Creepy.
Available preset Formations
It shall be done then!
Of course, as Mother Tree I will always be responsible for the entire elven race. Forever.
*Tell her that you have some bad news... regarding her husband.*
*The pain as the Source is torn from you is both agonising and sublime. And then it is gone. When she speaks the honey in her voice is gone. She speaks now as a demon.*
May they have the wisdom to return them here.
Dark Lady
Hah. Too bad. And here I thought everyone won their first match. Did you speak to the Burnished One?
From Charlie, we learned that Arhu went away with &apos;the smelly man&apos;.
*Her eyes flutter. She answers in a low voice.*
*The arm hits the sand and goes rigid. Its wrist rotates like a compass needle, a single bony finger pointing toward... what?*
*Her hand whips out and grabs your wrist like a vice.*
Trust me, I know what you are. And what you can be.
*The lizard is enveloped in a deep, unresponsive slumber.*
A creature appeared after we placed a piece of Source-Infused meat on the altar.
*Tell the creature that his princess is dead.*
*Wonder what it was she was contemplating when you caught her by surprise.*
[UNDEAD] *Tell her the Hall of Echoes holds the only peace she will ever find.*
*Stroke her cheek and tell her you want nothing more than to help her.*
*Shake your head. No deals.*
You sure as hell deserve it. Rest on those laurels for a good long while, if you can.
These beings had their time, and were overthrown. This is our world now - we have to fight for it.
Small Forest Beetle
I beg your pardon. You need to speak to the Advocate - the lizard by the table. He is waiting.
*Ask how much she&apos;d be willing to pay. You are, after all, a kin, and equally adept at lovemaking as she.*
Oh, &lt;i&gt;fantastic!&lt;/i&gt;
Teleport Cast
There&apos;s an air about this place. Something sinister just below the surface...
Okay! I&apos;m good at demon-watching. But you better watch out for the next bill. It&apos;ll be a doozy!
Physical Armour
*Biting deep into the rotting flesh, your senses are assailed with the rank odour of meat long past its prime. Your memory wavers and becomes not your own, but the memory of one who led the most solitary of lives.*
Aha! I found you, didn&apos;t I? Red, they said! Red, then &lt;i&gt;dead!&lt;/i&gt;
Knight of Vrogir
*Say you must have missed out on the fun.*
Rich, creamy, and comfortingly warm.

Majesty, she awaits you.
