This weird seed is hot to the touch and alien to the eyes, as if it blew in from another plane entirely.
Justinia has shown no mercy even to her own subjects - and deserves none from us.
*Shake your head and move on.*
An excellent choice.
*Tell him you&apos;ve &lt;i&gt;sss&lt;/i&gt;poken... spoken... with Alexandar, and he remains alive.*
(end)
Could be worse. It could be raining.
*Try &apos;magic word&apos;.*
You were no help at all. Say goodbye to Lohse. She&apos;s done for.
You&apos;re treading a fine line between friend and enemy lately.
Besides, I gotta go back to the kingdom. There&apos;s a lot to do there. Damage that needs undone. Dwarves&apos;ve lived in fear for too long, on the outside &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the inside.
*...then, after a moment&apos;s thought, indicates for you to help. Together you send Sarias to his final resting place.*
You look for trouble!
Have at it... we&apos;re not going to lay down our lives for some Silent Monks.

Long as you don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest, you can &apos;astard all you want.
I was victorious, but I had a pact with the arch-demon Adramahlihk. Together we claimed Divinity.
No-one knows what happened next. Was it wizardry? Was it Zorl-Stissa who took mercy on us even then? Suddenly we were dragons no more. Lizards instead. And as lizards we flourished and built an empire once more.
Smug prig. *Spits*
*&lt;i&gt;The Master and the Scar.&lt;/i&gt; Tell her it&apos;s an epic that deserves to be unwritten.*
*Say you came across Gareth not too long ago. He was having some trouble with an old friend of his - Jonathan, by name.*
There&apos;s a malevolent aura to this well-honed blade, as if it has only ever tasted innocence, and only ever rewarded it with death.
Deathfog&apos;s leaking out. If I were mortal, I&apos;d be getting the hell OUT of here!
Shwa! Shwa shwa! Got you!
*The Magister squints hard and grimaces.*
*Ask what happens if you open the chest.*
*Say you&apos;ve been on the road a while now. You&apos;d like to hear about where Ifan grew up.*
*The spirit of the priest floats silently. His robes billow as an unseen current of water shunts him about.*
Her Master is dead. Sebille is the new Mother. The fate of the elves is in our hands - we&apos;ll need the powers of Divinity to protect them.
What do you think you&apos;re doing? Show me all your bags.
The doors to the mountain are open. We need but step through.
I&apos;d give my own life to bring them back. I never... I never got that last chance to tell them I loved them. I never got to say goodbye...
*She bats her eyelashes as she turns her back to you.*
This city ain&apos;t ever gonna recover.
*His look is equal parts nonplussed and embarrassed.*
Across the bridge. Last I heard one of my scouts saw him heading down the southern road bound for Stonegarden.
See those structures, further inland? &lt;i&gt;Remarkably &lt;/i&gt;like those from the caverns of the Blackpits, aren&apos;t they? Should you discover the parts needed for a Swornbreaker, please bring them to me. *Smiles.* I&apos;ll make it worth your while...
We came here to free a Godwoken called Verdas from Fort Joy. He was our best hope, likely our &lt;i&gt;last &lt;/i&gt;hope... but we failed him. Now all we can do is flee.
*Look at him quizzically. He &lt;i&gt;wants &lt;/i&gt;to die?*
*He reaches out and gently touches your bandaged arm.*
Kniles seems to have misplaced his face-ripper. Or perhaps it was stolen.
*Say that you&apos;ve already destroyed an Ancestor Tree. You&apos;ll not be a slave to the shade of another.*
Select Item to add to barter
*The young woman lies still on the floor, her breathing an uneven rasp. Swann&apos;s satchel of surgical tools lies nearby...*
I hope so. I don&apos;t desire to be an engine of vengeance all my life.
You&apos;ll find out. Down the hatch, then.
Deny me if you must. A pebble like you, dropped into the sea that is my destiny, hardly makes a ripple.
We didn&apos;t help Tarquin with his search.
You seem nice and all, at least when the mood strikes ya. But I&apos;d rather chat with your leader, if you don&apos;t mind.
*The spirit turns and tries to run, but it&apos;s too late. You feel her power filling your body - crackling across your skin and filling your soul.*
Oh no you don&apos;t! You have to see the light, just like &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; showed me *SMASH*
*Say you don&apos;t know anything about it.*
Careful now. I think we ought to step lightly here.
Ba-BOCK!
*You turn towards the voice and see the broken body of a fawn. A raven is perched upon its head, pecking at the gory hollow that once held its eye.*
*Tell him he must be mistaken. You know no &apos;Lohse&apos;.*
But there is merit to my madness. Can you say the same of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; mania?
Brass Key
Journey to Arx.
Wands &amp; Staves
Dammit! That cheapskate owed me gold... Oh Brannt...
*Make yourself known. Announce that you&apos;re here to see Roost Anlon.*
*Your legs buckle, then ease you downwards. Beneath warm, golden crops is dark, damp soil... and bones. Bones of others who laid down to rest. And never rose up again.*
*Gareth shies away from you. His eyes pass over the half-filled graves and he takes a shuddering breath.*
*Confess. You are, indeed, a Sourcerer.*
*Leave the dwarf to his work.*
Compact
Duna be damned, but I&apos;m as groggy as a boozy baby.
*Ask the question burning in your mind: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Why? Why did you and Lucian send me on this suicide mission to kill all elves? Why did you lie to me?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Reduces the damage from fire-based attacks.
What happens to it, I wonder? Does it lie in whatever ditch it falls in as its body decays? Or - ah, no, of course. It is &lt;i&gt;harvested&lt;/i&gt;.
Not to mention an unparalleled lesson in love-making.
*The proprietress gives you the same sweet smile. She arches an eyebrow to ask what you want.*
Alertness
Warron
You&apos;re still here being crazy, I see. No offence, etc.
Alright, I look guilty. It&apos;s just... well... the food here is so good. All this death and rot. It&apos;s good pickings here for a rat who&apos;s not too picky about said pickings.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and Mordus&apos; cellar behind.
Do you think you don&apos;t have to listen to warnings or something? I&apos;m taking you to the cells!
Enable shadows thrown by light sources like campfires, torches, etc. Disabling vastly improves performance on low end GPUs.
Her signs, to call her.
*Say that you&apos;ve created a safe passage out of here.*
*Say you were merely teasing him. Let&apos;s find out what that spirit has to say.*
You fought well today, Paladin. Made me proud.
*Question him: Your chance for what?*
Challenger of Summer
I don&apos;t expect a great intellect to offer much welcome at all. But I respect your point. While most humans in Arx lunge for each others&apos; kneecaps, I see you seek a better way.
Looks like it&apos;s my lucky day!
Jahan died before he could help us unlock our Source powers.
Don&apos;t think I don&apos;t see you. Don&apos;t think I&apos;m not watching.
No, no, no. There&apos;s an air of underling about you. You&apos;re not fit to parley with a prince.
Give me all that I gave to you, and do it now, before the Six return to their senses and claim what&apos;s rightfully mine. &lt;i&gt;Give me your body and soul.&lt;/i&gt;
Keep out of this!
Grim for sure. But what gets me is... why? The rebellion&apos;s scattered all over the Hinterlands. Deathfog&apos;s deadly, but it ain&apos;t precise. It&apos;s overkill for a ragtag array of revolutionaries.

*The spirit of another orc stands before you - a priestess. She gapes at something looming high above her, approaching from the other side of the hall...*
But I wasn&apos;t going to... He&apos;s my chance to...
You cannot comprehend what it is. But you know full well what it &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt;. The Void will not stop until it has devoured us all.
Fancy gewgaws and gadgetry for the modern adventurer!
Quite so, but your aura is - well, &apos;weak&apos; is probably not the correct word...
*Say a farewell.*
Vampiric Hunger Aura Skillbook
*Sigh loudly, hand over your gear, then walk away, his purse heavy in your pocket.*
A cremation pyre... &apos;From fire to ash. From ember to flame.&apos;
&lt;i&gt;&apos;...the damned...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
The elven Lone Wolf&apos;s hidden hoard.
*He holds the apple to your mouth. It feels surprisingly soft and wet. &lt;i&gt;He squeezes... &lt;/i&gt;Liquid spills onto your chin.*
Journey on.
It is done. I hope it helps, Godwoken. The world needs someone like you.
Hm. Must be a lonely little guy.
*Emotions that are not yours wash across your consciousness - loathing, fury, guilt - before retreating into the shadows of your mind.*
*Say you need to know who issued the Godwoken contract.*
Find the Sallow Man&apos;s magic mirror.
Hammered Scale Helmet
He- he wanted the Deathfog destroyed. Once he knew his rats had found it in the Peacemaker&apos;s wreck, he wanted it &lt;i&gt;destroyed&lt;/i&gt;.
*The lever won&apos;t budge - it&apos;s jammed in place.*
I won&apos;t soon forget this madness. Or you, either.
Ah, Deathfog. Instant victory. I always applauded Lucian for using it.
*Tell her you&apos;d be happy to take the spore there for her.*
*His bemused expression hardens into worry as he scans the notes.*
Wine. But no ordinary wine. This was made from the grapes of vines that meander along my palace&apos;s walls like the curious fingers of lovers.
Build new wings. Feast upon flesh. But if you should bring shame to that holy accoutrement, I will find you in the Hall of Echoes myself.
Gargoyle Statue
You eat cats?
*Protect the spirit from the truth: consume her Source.*
*Then quite suddenly there&apos;s blood everywhere as Stingtail falls to the ground, face first into his own intestines.*
*Fire. Everything is fire. If you can confine such magic to a rune, you can feed the burning urge inside the dragon&apos;s skull.*
Though these scalemail pants are lined and padded, they&apos;re still not the most comfortable garment you&apos;ve ever worn.
*Ask the spirit how she came to be like this in the first place.*
*Sniffle.* Mommy&apos;s sleepin&apos; an&apos; she won&apos; wake up!
*Tell him his composition could use some work.*
*He takes your hand and kisses it with great courtesy.*
Lohar? Yeah, I know of the guy, from back when I was lookin&apos; for fishin&apos; work out in Driftwood. He&apos;s - how shall I say - an &lt;i&gt;entrepreneur. &lt;/i&gt;Still out there, I bet. Had his stubby fingers in a lot o&apos; pies, if you get my meaning!
*Smiles...* Claim... your... fee... in... knowledge.

*His eyes fall upon you. They blaze with fury.*
*You look at Sebille. Her stare could make a lion cower.*
Right good to see ya again, guv&apos;nor!
Clever, clever. Yes, I am the Devourer. And you? You are the one I have chosen.&lt;br&gt;
*As you pick up the ring, you feel a cold, dark pain shoot up your arm. Your mind itches...*
Key to the Merchant Estate
Don&apos;t you keep defying me, Sebille.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him that in the absence of a higher authority, you&apos;re the best judge available.*
We&apos;re doing our duty! Our brothers have a Seeker cornered while we guard the rear. There&apos;s a lot of fight in the scum, but he can&apos;t hold out forever.
Magister Loke
Sounds like somethin&apos; bad though, the way you say it. Mordus were nothin&apos; but trouble, anyway. Ya know what &apos;lurkin&apos; is? He did that a lot. Lurked.
*She frowns, wrinkling up her smooth forehead and cocking her head to one side.*
*Take your leave.*
And you look like a donkey&apos;s you-know-what, &apos;ut I&apos;s too &apos;olite... &apos;olite... I&apos;s too well-&apos;annered to say it. Just don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
