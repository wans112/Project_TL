We&apos;ll uh... we&apos;ll talk about this later.
You! You know what we do with violent offenders like you? We throw &apos;em into prison!
Vitality, Damage, Physical Armour and Magical Armour increased by Summoning ability of the master.
A solid surface for crafting upon.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;A true warrior never tips her hand.&apos; &lt;/i&gt;This was the advice I was given by the King of All Rats himself! I cannot divulge until you agree.

You are kinder to him than fate has been.
Discard Hero
Consul Praxyr
Chief Looter
The farms and the fisheries fought to feed the people, against the Voidwoken blight.
*Ask him what he wants to know.*
What a waste of a healing potion. You should have just left me as you found me.
Yes - that&apos;s it! It&apos;s showing me the war. Elves dying. Deathfog in the forests.
Magister&apos;s Sword
A conscientious objector. How very tedious.
*The words wrap themselves around you, then slip through your pores. You feel as if you could skate upon water or leap among the clouds. You are no longer&lt;i&gt; less&lt;/i&gt;, but&lt;i&gt; more.*&lt;/i&gt;
Here. I bet you know your prickets from your portraits. Wanna trade?

We acquired the painting.
These &apos;Purging Wands&apos; are the key to our escape - we have to find some, then return to Gareth.

Hell no. You know what Reimond would do if he caught us?
*Tell her you left it in more than capable hands.*
QA DEBUG BOOK
Courage
It is simultaneously too detailed and insufficient. I know the beginning of this tale and the end, but I am rather missing the middle.
A shame he could never see past his own clouded vision. The royals came for his sister - but he still couldn&apos;t condemn them, even as they ran. He played both sides - and it&apos;s her that bears the burden.
Heresy! Come, pray with me and regain your faith. I pledge my heart, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my soul, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my life, O Lucian, please return.
Lucky for us, she had the skills to remove them. There&apos;s many a Sourcerer that&apos;s been freed thanks to her.
Magic Trader
Brutal Sword
Getting used to the Griff crowd. Last week I had a cold, and Waltz gave me half her soup ration. Said I needed to stay well. She acted like it was just so I could stand guard, but I knew better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soup tasted like mouldy socks, all the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faces go in and out of this place all the time. Five new folks one day; five get rounded up and hauled into the Fort the next. Always different faces. Itâ€™s like passing portraits in a long, long hall.
Fulton? It&apos;s so dark... where are you?
You feel it don&apos;t you, Sebille? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are now our heart.
Plague
What?! You mean I helped a filthy &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt; Get away from me!
House Exterior - Double Houses
Though if they return... what becomes of this world...
&lt;i&gt;Go then.&lt;/i&gt;
A child&apos;s prayer left here... &apos;Dear Luuceen. Ask mommy to stop crying.&apos;
Only Ifan himself knows the truth.
&apos;kay good!
Choose &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, or you cast us, the kingdom, and all that is into the eternal Void.
*Ask what it&apos;s worth to him.*
*Say &apos;food&apos;.*
Over my dead body.

Consider it forgotten.
&lt;i&gt;Why do you fear, little Paladin? You wear my armour and make us One. Now we fear no-one.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her her problems are your problems from here on out.*
*Proclaim that you have witnesses that can prove your whereabouts.*
I did my best. This time it was enough.
*Wonder about Braccus Rex. What was he doing here?*
A pipe that allows the wielder to smoke herbal mixtures.
Gratiana used the pain and deaths of others for her pleasure. She should be damned until the end of time.
Oh ho! Well in that case, prepare to die, killer!
Is she ready to sail?
*Take her by the hand and tell her to get up.*
This hat is so fine and dandy that anyone who speaks to you while you wear it will be convinced that you are a noble.
*Ask him what crime saw him end up a head on a stick.*
Shadowblade
[BARBARIAN] *You don&apos;t need any stupid wriggling lamp! Smash the damned thing.*
Too much, you might say. I can make them bleed any which way you want. Which is?
I am. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind, in fact.
Responsible? No. I have... regrets. If the Magisters had not come, it would have not happened. It is not our fault that our talents draw the Void. We are not the problem. We are the hope.
*You are a Magister, chasing a Sourceress. First in the farmlands of Paradise Downs, where her Sourcery drew Voidwoken. The damage was immeasurable. You harden your heart that you may do your job.*
*He takes the letter from your hands and reads it quickly, face hardening with anger as he reaches the end.*
If you got some fight in you, then I&apos;ve got what you need!
*Allow yourself to be arrested.*
*The old king responds. He vibrates. You feel the power come to you. The world darkens and fades...*
Fancy Key
Each ally consumes frozen surfaces around them, converting the frozen surfaces to Magic Armour. Removes Burning and Necrofire.
My last hope of ever being freed of the God King&apos;s terrible tyranny
[IFAN] *Note the broken rapier: thirteen years&apos; bad luck for the wielder. Ask if it&apos;s his.*
*The stag&apos;s head watches over the room, its black eyes wide and unblinking.*
Tell them all about your lost little boy. Tell them about your so-called angel. Tell them what happens when you defy the will of the Order.
BACAWWWWWWRICKA!
And I will have to take your word for it, won&apos;t I?
Ancient Conductor
By the by, a black little birdie told me you&apos;ve a ship along the shore. That is where we&apos;ll go. Enjoy a bit of sun while we wait for you to conclude your business along Reaper&apos;s Coast.
*You recall Sadas. House of War. Remembering how you turned his own pet rattler against him still fills you with delight.*
Really?
Yes... mistress...
Such a gallant goal - but Her Royal Majesty needs no rescuing, I assure you. Now then. We adhere to a certain decorum in this court. I am sure you understand, my prince.
*A surge of light from the second candle - it&apos;s in a panic, its energy furious and full of hatred; it doesn&apos;t want you to snuff them out!*
I... I don&apos;t think you are.
*Squeak!*
There&apos;s no time to waste - we have to see what was done to her!
Sear to seal in all those delicious juices.
Locked!
*Silently bare your arm and show him his name tattooed on your skin.*
*Say you heard him fine: he doesn&apos;t suffer fools... and you&apos;re not a fool.*
I tried that already. Trust me, it did not go well.
You&apos;re so cool. I bet you&apos;ve been everywhere! Can you tell me a story?
I see you. Our scion is with us in this moment, so in this moment we leave this place. I see you.
My, you&apos;re a fine figure of an elf! Care to trade, my tall friend?
Haha! Sounds like a man I&apos;d buy two flagons o&apos; mead for: one for drinkin&apos; and one for toastin&apos;! I, uh, got somethin&apos; for him. I&apos;ll tell him you sent your regards, mister...
Statue
*Very well, you accept his offer. You&apos;re ready to learn how to channel more Source.*
The Dean&apos;s Office
That is... unfortunate.
This gate&apos;s to be kept clear. Be on your way.
I mean the metaphysical. That moment where life slips to death. The instant of feeling your soul depart your body.
&apos;To Paradise Downs and Driftwood&apos;
Large Rock Rune Of Power
Heh. T&apos;think they say that lizards ain&apos;t got a bit of humour in &apos;em. I almost believ... oh. Yer as serious as a boil on me bum, ain&apos;t ya?

*She drums on her forehead with two fingers, smiles grimly, and shrugs.*
Tangleweed
Huh? What&apos;re ya doin&apos; here? Didn&apos;t Griff already take one &apos;a them ears &apos;a yours?
*The thud of your fist upon the wood resonates deeper than you&apos;d expected it to. It turns into what sounds like a moan... then echoes away into silence. The door remains closed.*
[DWARF] *Ask about his travels. Has he ever been to Justinia&apos;s queendom?*
This book is filled with unfamiliar script and figures. Quite useless indeed.
I know. Or did you think I chose you for nothing more than our shared humanity?
Like I would about the return of the codpiece: that it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;highly&lt;/i&gt; unfashionable.
Incandescent Scorcher
*The three kids stare at you in awe.*
A knight of old, ready to die over a foolish king&apos;s whim.
I go because it is every citizen&apos;s duty: our communal obligation to chant the Rites of the Return and pray for Lucian&apos;s divine resurrection!
&lt;i&gt;You&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;the one that&apos;s boring. And you look like a zombie vampire, but not the cool kind!
So much effort to maintain secrecy... what are the Magisters hiding?
I must be delirious... you look like &lt;i&gt;death! &lt;/i&gt;*Cough.* Help, please... I need healing!
I suppose it wouldn&apos;t be entirely proper to continue without our esteemed figurehead.
*Stab the fingers of your left hand straight for his eyes.*
Target character and surrounding allies receive Sparkmaster status that adds a chance of fiery Sparks to melee attacks.
*Ask the spirit if it&apos;s in pain.*
This? This is the home of Rhalic on earth. You would be wise to bow your head in his honour, as &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;the races should bow before his chosen ones.
*The rat&apos;s tail twists and untwists. His ears cock and uncock.*
*Take the dagger and drive it into his chest.*
*The royal guards unsheathe their blades and point them not at Isbeil - but at the queen.*
*Say you are.*
*Hellish laughter erupts from the little girl.*
The Beast of the Sea! Stories of your beard alone fly &apos;cross Rivellon like flocks of crows. Fair bit more inland than you&apos;d prefer, yeah?
*Tell him you&apos;ll take whatever assistance he offers.*
Canary
[MYSTIC] *Tell him that seeing beyond the veil of the living was most rewarding.*
Deploy Mass Traps Scroll
*She turns back to her fallen self once more, her eyes glistening.*
I will be, I think, now that I&apos;m out of Kemm&apos;s damnable clutches! He and his Black Ring cronies will stop at nothing!
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Allow Beast to interject.*
[LOHSE] *Laugh and say you were too busy being possessed to think of becoming a god-conduit.*
*Tell the Dreamer to wait.*
