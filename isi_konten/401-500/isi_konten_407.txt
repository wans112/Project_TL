I... was not chosen for divinity. Instead, I became a guardian of this temple - a Knight of Rhalic.
*Ask her what she&apos;s saying - you can&apos;t understand.*
Elven Great Sword
Removing a level will return [1] ability point(s)
&lt;i&gt;Incorrrrrect!&lt;/i&gt;
Give her the Swornbreaker. She&apos;s no threat to us; not anymore.
Go find a little one to bother; I take my peace.
Withermoore&apos;s Girdle
In any case, it looks like they&apos;re probably going to help me find out whatever&apos;s leechin&apos; off my magnificent brain. So I&apos;m not too pressed about being in the same boat.
He&apos;d hold civilians hostage to save his own hide? I&apos;d expect nothing less of a Sourcerer.
You speak my name; you know my torture. Please - don&apos;t judge me for the sickness my roots have spread...
Daddy, I think my husband is trying to kill you.
You - oh. I see. Perhaps I misjudged our relationship.
*...and the last thing you see is her screaming in pain as she dies. And then, with not even a lingering echo, she is gone.*
*Shake your head. You didn&apos;t catch anyone red-handed.*
Syrus Oates silently thanked us, then left for the Hall of Echoes.
Go to Reimond at the docks. He&apos;ll want to know of the news you bring. And hurry - he sails soon.
Adramahlihk...
*You are the best of the best! Demand a battle versus the Driftwood arena champion.*
[OUTLAW] *Snort and say it sounds like he&apos;d benefit from the... &lt;i&gt;loss &lt;/i&gt;of certain in-laws.*
Stewart&apos;s Old Shield
Adelliah
*Tell him that if you had run, the undead would&apos;ve chased you anyway.*
Have faith, my sister, have faith!
Secretly undead, Mordus has a hidden agenda. Interest in the Deathfog shipment comes from many quarters, it seems.
*Her right hand goes for her needle: a quick, routine motion - but then she stops herself.*
Stay away from the Magisters, sister. They killed that fellow back there. They&apos;ll hide the evidence well enough, but I know it all the same.
Can you &lt;i&gt;please &lt;/i&gt;just stay dead?!
*In battle you refuse to kill Magisters. For this crime you face execution at the hands of Lord Kemm. But at the last minute you gain a reprieve. That reprieve proves... temporary.*
Do... do you say something? I am so sure I can smell you sssay something.
Gareth&apos;s the only one that brings her out of herself. Without him she&apos;s... well...
Pizza Dough
*Wide-eyed, ask what&apos;s down in the cellar.*
If you can&apos;t be bothered to visit the Meistr, I&apos;d recommend you deign to visit other powerful Sourcerers on your travels. You need to learn everything they can teach you if you&apos;re going to do what needs to be done.
[IFAN] *Whatever has happened, it left a glint in your eye. Source is rushing through you like a river through a canyon.*
Ignorant?! I daresay I have a better knowledge of this world than any creature living in it.
...or the time it rained really hard in the Graveyard, and your clothes, um...
Someone&apos;s already pillaged and poisoned this pumpkin&apos;s treasures.
What the- what the hell is that? What are you doing? No-
*Wonder if he means Isbeil. You know all about his wind-up toys.*
*A ghostly seaman stares at the captain, his lip curled in a malevolent grin, his eyes wide with hate... and all the time, he rings his bell. He registers your presence. His head swivels towards you.*
Hey&apos;o, Mar... er, Beast.
Take on the challengers.
My prince, your children will help you! Your companion has one of our eggs. All you need to do is engulf it with fire. Do so, and your child will be born, ready even now to fight by your side!
*You feel the Source beating inside the jar, but you also feel the collar around your neck. As you reach out, the collar tightens and burns, while the Source retreats deeper into the jar.*
*Claim that you overheard Malady declaring she&apos;d have no choice but to execute the prisoner if she wouldn&apos;t help them.*
Could Sadha too be in Arx?
*Take Mummy Dearest&apos;s head from your pack and hold it up by the hair for him to see.*
GIVE IT TO ME.
More black wax. Another life sacrificed. I can&apos;t bear it...
*You look at his hand and see that the skin is midnight black. It seems to undulate, as if worms were squirming through his flesh.*
*He reaches for your hand and shakes it, his eyes smiling.*
*Ask her what she&apos;s got.*
Wonderful. Then the time to cull has come.
Well yes, of course. I&apos;m not unsympathetic, you know. But I don&apos;t have time for teary eyes and sniffles. So if you please, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve your own burdens to bear...
Stay&lt;i&gt; silent&lt;/i&gt;, dwarf!
*Smile at her suavely say that, yes, for all intents and purposes you are a bachelor. Free. No strings attached.*
Once the Black Ring have been eliminated, I have been authorised to send you on your way with that which you pursue - the location of the Council of Seven.
You speak the spell with a ferocity I have not heard in centuries, as I knew you would, dear Fane.
Ladder
*Prudence takes up a clean glass and starts to polish it with her rag, rubbing at invisible water spots with zeal.*
I like a kin who knows what she wants and isn&apos;t afraid to take it. You&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. But let&apos;s take it slow. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?&lt;br&gt;
Boiled Stardust
I suppose that&apos;s our fault. Me &apos;n&apos; Conway never liked how the Order&apos;s been dealing with Sourcerers. We did our best to help &apos;em when we could, which is why we called Hannag here. There was a younger fella here who seemed in want of some... direction. But things didn&apos;t turned out like we hoped, as you can see.
*You know what, say that sounds absolutely &lt;i&gt;wonderful.*&lt;/i&gt;
Nuh-uh! I&apos;d eat... seven.
[The handwriting in Reimond&apos;s private journal is so full of flourishes, whorls and loops that it almost seems as if he wants to obfuscate the meaning of the text within. Much of it sounds half-crazed, but some passages bear lucid details.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, the GRAND Design will be upon us, soon it will be realised. The time of the White Magisters has come, the grandest DESIGN of all...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have a SACRED DUTY to CLEANSE the world of the filth of Source... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...OUR Lucian guides us, today as always... I would have relished accompanying Dallis to the Tomb of Lucian, to see our final victory come to pass. But I am needed here, and I shall see that my sacred duty is fulfilled. I will see NO-ONE enter the Tomb. And I will destroy all papers, scrolls, and MINDS that would reveal the way.
Do you see? You are the first of &lt;i&gt;so many.&lt;/i&gt;
Let the Void take her, then!
*He glowers at you... and vanishes into the ether, holding your gaze until he is gone.*
*Say you know all about his plan to ambush Isbeil.*
Breathing Bubble Skillbook
*Gareth falls to his knee and looks to his feet.*
*You received his invitation. You&apos;re here now. Tell him to talk.*
*Inform them that Lohar sent you.*
*You sit at a fire. At your left lies a black dog basking in the warmth. Others huddle behind you: a young elf, a grizzled dwarf, and... a skeleton. An undead.*
The door to the Doctor&apos;s house opened for us.
Hmm... and I think it&apos;s fair to say you didn&apos;t come to save my hide out of the kindness of your heart either.
*Say you&apos;d better be moving on.*
*Sebille gently places a hand on the small of your back. Her mouth reaches your ear with a whisper:*
Sir! &lt;i&gt;Sir! &lt;/i&gt;Quit thy poking and prithee leave yon Jimmy alone. Our lad will ruffle up his feathers in his own sweet time!
Common Knife
Carrion Beetle
Spirit of Zharat
Voidwoken ruined the Ros garden wedding. Only the cake stood untouched.
Sharpshooter
The island seems to be inaccessible to Magister forces. We should find our own way there.
I am pleased to see you&apos;ve rid yourself of your chains. Your physical chains, at least.  Please, be welcome.
I&apos;ve an errand to run around here first... I&apos;ll catch up with you there later.
*She turns her head and looks you straight in the eye.*
Target character consumes blood surfaces around them, restoring Vitality. The more blood, the more they will be healed!
Come on now, back to the Student&apos;s Hall. There&apos;ll be plenty of time for you to explore the Gallery tomorrow.
Decomposing Cryomancer
Memory
No saving throw
But if you are quite done with your impossibly complex social cues, I have rather more important things to do.
Then you must do it now, without fear or hesitation. Time is running short. And know this - if you would reach the Council and be Divine, all the evil in the world will rise to stop you. May you have more strength than I.
We&apos;d have more luck askin&apos; Duna to open it for us than for it to budge by our own hands.
Nnnnggh...
Birds Deep Forest 04
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll kill you stone dead.&lt;/i&gt;
Very well. Preparations will be made, and the half-breed elf will be summoned.
*You shake in anticipation. Tell it you feel ravenous and powerful at the same time.*
Decoration
He&apos;s gone.
Some characters prefer to talk to your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/font&gt;. If the avatar is near, the conversation will start with them &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;automatically&lt;/font&gt;.
Lizard Warrior
[ELF] *Tell him you found evidence of Deathfog in the cave. The same vile substance the Divine used to annihilate most of your people.
New Paragraph
*The scribe fills the parchment before him at a rapid pace, a self-satisfied smile playing on his lips.*
Party
Advice? Hm. Hold onto yourself, kin. The fort is full of decent folks turned savage by confinement. Do not let it happen to you. Hold onto your dignity, if you have any left.
I will lead you to the lake, my child, but not yet. Not until you have become a true Master of the Source: until you speak the language of creation itself.
Vampiric Magical
Quest Items
[1] increases the overall damage by [2]%.
Hay
So close... but Divinity will never be mine now. Do what you must, Godwoken.
Medium Poison Resistance Potion
*The bear gives you a serious look. She opens her mouth wide, her great fangs on display for you. Then she clears her throat.*
[OUTLAW] *Say that you&apos;re the scout of an army that&apos;s here to attack Fort Joy.*
*Your footsteps fall into a heavy rhythm, like a pickaxe striking stone. A dozen pickaxes, working in labored unison.*
But this is the best time of all. You, just dancing a contract into my lap. What else are friends for?
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
We ate Roost&apos;s hand. The contract on Saheila came from a hooded figure, apparently from the Ancient Empire.
Assassinate the Advocate.
*Say Madam Zoor sent you.*
*Ask the undead creature who she is.*
How much do you think I get out? All I know is there&apos;re more like you - well, not quite like &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
Again...
You&apos;ve had warning after warning - no more!
You&apos;ve come from Fort Joy? Can I ask if... did you happen to meet a man named Gareth on your way here through the swamp?
Battle raged in a ruined castle.
BOCK!!
&lt;i&gt;Connected as one, the past and the present slain.&lt;br&gt;Absolution and redemption await the one whose sins are many.&lt;/i&gt;
Ranger AI
Shadow&apos;s Eye
Of course, of course! We&apos;ll, erm, discuss the specifics once you&apos;ve returned.
Oh please, I have no interest in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. Your books are too full of it already.
Plinth
That voice... I can&apos;t remember what happened, but I can&apos;t forget that voice.
|Shockwave|
Tir-Cendelius, God of Elves
*She looks hurt. Downtrodden. She steps forward strokes your cheek, soft, gentle skin running over bone.*
