*The spirit is silent, but his face is not. A plethora of emotions cross it, as if he relives a lifetime of memories in this single moment.*
In the dream world we came to a desert camp. Red Prince seems to find it familiar. The camp is... occupied.
Mordus was right - the cargo was destined for Arx.
And there you have it. I hope one of &apos;em can tell you what you need to know.
*The rat tries to nod its head and fails. It tries to shake its head and fails. Its head ends up doing a strange, jerking diagonal movement that could mean anything.*
*Tell her you want all of her.*
My name was once on a list like this.
It seems Dallis had ordered that I be held until she could do the deed herself. To give it the personal touch, I imagine.
Should get movin&apos;, I guess. But I got that fog feelin&apos;. Can&apos;t tell if I&apos;m sleepin&apos;, or if me eyes are just cloudy.
*Say that you heard word around town - some Magisters have abandoned their posts lately.*
&apos;Medicine&apos;. What a shame! All you need&apos;s a strong constitution and the gods&apos;ll take care o&apos; the rest.
Left behind like a dog... Bah! Seven curses upon that ship!
A pity. But far be it from me to force you. Let &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; be your intoxication instead.
A dreeeam come truuuue!
We found a Purging Wand in Braccus&apos;s vault. Now we can take on the Shriekers.
*He rolls up his sleeves and produces a surgeon&apos;s knife.*
*Beast looks to you gratefully and closes his eyes, lost in the rhythm of your stroking.*
*Tell him the Deathfog device is in place.*
You wriggling little worms.
*He spits over his shoulder, folding thick arms across his steel-bound chest.*
*The turtle blinks out a few slow tears.*
Big Dwarven Mace
I related how the Deathfog attack unfolded before I could complete my mission. I could not save my people.
[BARBARIAN] *Grunt that your pervasive bloodthtirst is driving you to madness. Thanks for asking.*
*shrug* I don&apos;t know if anyone&apos;s free of anything &lt;i&gt;once and for all.&lt;/i&gt;
*Leave her bound.*
Rhalic&apos;s faithful servant. What would he say if he saw his God now?
Well I think you&apos;re a big, dumb tree-lady with leaves coming out of your nose and dead grass where your brain should be! And you EAT PEOPLE! So THERE!
*Tell her you wouldn&apos;t resurrect a Magister for anything.*
*A light sea breeze kisses your cheek and carries away the smell of blood wafting up from the deck. In the distance, Fort Joy looms.*
It lies to the east, beneath the earth - if it hasn&apos;t already been destroyed.
[SCHOLAR] *Impossibly, the words are alien to you. Demand it speak in a common tongue.*
I owe you, Godwoken. Without your help, I&apos;d likely still be a prisoner around here, not guarding Alexandar-the-Bloody-Divine himself...
&lt;b&gt;Your trick failed already. Leave us.&lt;/b&gt;
*He howls in pain, and hate, and rage, and tries to push you away - but he cannot. So he closes his eyes, and summons... &lt;i&gt;everything.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Purr.*
You sure you want to do that? You &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;sure?
It gives me joy to see you, Sebille. And your friend too.
You. Eyes over here, yeah? I know she&apos;s pretty, but me wife&apos;s here t&apos;work, not t&apos;gawk at. Now what&apos;ll it be?
Kikiki-ki-ki-kuk...kuk...kuk...&lt;i&gt;kuh!&lt;/i&gt;
Creates a poison cloud with a 4m radius.

*The dwarf stares down at her broken body, cursing Lohar&apos;s &apos;cowardice&apos;. *

The rain&apos;s sweeter knowing that freak of an elf won&apos;t stalk these cobbles no more.
Oh, he does love a goooood nibble! If it meant he&apos;d stick arouuuuund, I&apos;d lie in a bed of aaaaaples!
[RED PRINCE] *Admit that in your darkest hour, you fear you&apos;re not as infallible as you like to pretend you are. That a demon may overtake you, or that true love never come to pass.*
*Say that you&apos;ve proven yourself many times over already. You&apos;ve kept him safe so far- he knows he can trust you to do the right thing.*
Are you a religious person?
*He gives you a look - bafflement, hopelessness and innocence radiating from those big eyes. But then... a grin unfurls upon his lips. A grin that does not reach his eyes.*
Blunt
[FANE] *Give yourself to the Lady Amadia. She is your better by right. &lt;i&gt;She is your god.*&lt;/i&gt;
Back off, pigeon. This is my bridge... and I don&apos;t suffer fools on it.
Fear not the weapon, but they who wield it. Deathfog has a place in the world... in the right hands.
Good luck, dear child. Make me proud.
And... if I may: The city&apos;s in quite a state, as I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve noticed. Voidwoken within and without. Civil war between the powers that be.
Away with you.
Deals damage upon expiring and infects the nearest player with Explosive Filth.
*Observe that she seems to know a lot about Braccus. Is she a student of history?*
True Art requires sacrifice... artists must put &lt;i&gt;themselves &lt;/i&gt;onto the canvas...
*Tell her she&apos;s been playing coy for the both of you. You are no Magister. She&apos;ll either lower that crossbow, or shoot you. It&apos;s her choice.*
Tovah accepted our help.
Lady Rabenmond
Jules! You bastards - he had only just returned from the brink of death!
If she is, Lord Kemm will want to know. Kemm commands the city now.
*Leave her; there&apos;s no time.*
You have a death wish. Let me fulfill it.
*Ask why he chose this place.*
Increase surface brush
Tir-Cendelius, the elven cannibal. That should have been a hint.
Forgive me, kin. Were that I had more than... gruel to serve. If I&apos;d more than cornmeal and rotting roots, I&apos;d concoct something more fitting.
Let&apos;s track down my old pack and find out who&apos;s behind the contracts to kill Godwoken.
Unnnghhh. They&apos;re eating holes in my mind. They&apos;re making tunnels... This is how she makes them. This is how she does it. But you...
Swear no oath; make no pact. Only then are you among the free.
*Ask about the One. Who or what is that?*
Ain&apos;t looking too good for them lizards! Word is the Divine Order&apos;s gonna hit the Ancient Empire and hit it hard!
Someone wants to discourage visitors.
You don&apos;t know his nature. He wanders the planes of the living &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the dead. I... I can&apos;t escape him.
I could be worse.
*RUFF!*
Blood Demon
Escape from Reaper&apos;s Eye.
*Hurry this along. &apos;Stomach!&apos;*
I won&apos;t be the one to make you regret it should you never wield Anathema. But regret it you certainly will.
What the hell do you think it means?
*Offer your condolences for the loss of Sarias.*
I don&apos;t got answers. You?
Neutral
*Beast pulls your hand to his hairy cheek, and you caress it until he giggles and cringes from the tickle.*
Good enough for me.
*Straining and grunting, your strength just about manages to nudge open the hatch.*
You serious?
*The word goes unheeded. You will need more than a password to enter, it seems.*
This is what I deserve for following the orders of a leader with the spine of a sponge. Thank Duna, Her Majesty has more steel in her belly than that coward.
Pile of Burnt Corpses
As she lives... you will die.
History? &lt;i&gt;History&lt;/i&gt; is written by victors. Do not doubt, our Divine Order will prevail...
*Say you never met him.*
This place can breed a grim sense of humour, no doubt, but you watch your words. I feel for the lass; she&apos;s no stranger.
That didn&apos;t work... the wrong order of levers perhaps...?
The locals liked and respected Almira -
*You recall this stone to be the &apos;gem of the desert&apos;. Outside the Empire, it is known as a mere fire rune.*
Our bag was stolen from Lohar. Looks like it&apos;s gone for good.
*Say you arrived here by mistake and had no intention of disturbing him.*
[FANE] *Explain that rules must sometimes be broken to reveal uncharted knowledge.*
Folder
Do it, or don&apos;t. First, I lay my past to rest. Then, I see justice done.
*Ask the spirit who this elf is.*
Key to the Consulate Garden
*But then, you hear a voice. A friendly whisper from... &lt;i&gt;beyond. &lt;/i&gt;The voice knows you. He understands you. He &lt;i&gt;loves&lt;/i&gt; you. He offers you your freedom. And asks but one small service in return.*
It was then, forced as I was to wander the wilds, that a voice first began to reach me in dreams.
Regardless, I must get out of here. I have a duty to fulfil.
You can get out of here, or I&apos;ll introduce your guts to the floor. How&apos;s that for trouble?
*Tell her you&apos;ll soon be in charge around here - and she&apos;ll have nothing to fear from you. If she does right by you now, that is...*
A large-sized protective potion that can fortify you against geomantic attacks.
It is done. Wield your strength wisely, Godwoken. Farewell.
*Note that Lohar seems to have turned on the queen...*
And they did it in my name. They did it because of me...
[VILLAIN] *Put a pillow over his face and press down.*
Domineering Statue of Braccus Rex
It shall be the last thing in this putrid realm you witness.
*Tell him you&apos;re just a woman, trying to survive.*
I just worry it won&apos;t treat a group of mystic squirrel knights forming a doomsday cult dedicated to ending the world with a giant acorn with the seriousness it deserves.
*You shape to attack. He sees it coming...*
A weapon of untold destruction. And you use it against your own kind? Knowing it ends their existence? How barbarous.
*So that is the grand plan, ask? To do as Lucian once did?*
Sword and shield: every human&apos;s first and last resort.
Okay.
Step back, step back... you humans don&apos;t know your own power!

BY THE HAZING OF THE SHADE I&apos;LL KILL YOUR SHINING LIGHTS! &lt;i&gt;I&apos;LL KILL YOUR SHINING LIGHTS!&lt;/i&gt;
Save myself and snuff the light from gods-know-how-many souls, or accept that my life is over...
The Scion Saheila is dead. This keepsake is hers. You should have it now. I want it not.
*He laughs... and laughs... and laughs... and laughs...*
Keep your essences close.
Death waits for them in the swamps. And worse waits if the Magisters take them alive.
In what was left of the woods, we came upon an elven encampment. The guards seem... on edge.
Come on, I&apos;m ready - &lt;i&gt;finish this!&lt;/i&gt;
Nothing frightens people so much as what they are. Takes a very sharp needle to pierce that veil.
Though her fans kept her music alive, Lohse would never sing again.
W-what happened? How is it so cold...?
Ranley. Caulker&apos;s Mate. &lt;i&gt;Lady Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt;
Once upon a long time ago, I would&apos;ve killed anyone who even looked sideways at Lucian... not today.
Griffin&apos;s Egg
He trembled, as if in pain. I didn&apos;t know what was going on, until quite suddenly his right hand became a flame.
Once, Lucian the Divine united the powers of the Seven against the Void. He lead the people of Rivellon to glory. Now, my child, you will do the same. But unlike Lucian, you will not fail.
I&apos;ve had enough of your insolence, merc. Hey lads!
*Wonder why he entrusts the Beast o&apos; the Sea with this power. You are not one for authority figures...*
*Tell him he is mistaken: you never &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; anything be done to you. You were forced, just like he was now forcing you.*
