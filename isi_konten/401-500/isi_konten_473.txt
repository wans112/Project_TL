*Stay quiet as they depart. There&apos;s nothing to be accomplished by attacking now.*
*Ask her about the One. Who or what is that?*
*Ask whether this Emmie is the reason he seems so blue.*
Your guess is as good as mine, for once. If it were me, I&apos;d start with the Divine Order in the city. Last I heard, there were plenty of Magisters within the city walls. If their beloved leader is among them, they&apos;ll likely have heard about it.
That conjurer was sent to help us - she&apos;s flooding the temple with seawater. *spits* Not good. It&apos;ll look like we couldn&apos;t manage... but the next one - the &lt;i&gt;next one&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;ll take if it costs me every soldier under my command.
*Smirk and say you&apos;d like to see him try.*
When the dust settled, no new Divine had risen. Instead, all Source was released into the world, for all the people and every creature to share. Everyone was now a Sourcerer, and united, the peoples of Rivellon pushed back the God King into the very depths of the Void. This ushered in a new golden age of peace and prosperity. But alas, it was not to last. With many greedy for wealth, power and position, the struggle soon began anew. Source, the very language of creation, was used in violence once more. The never-ending contest for power continued.

We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without bringing Wylvia to justice.

Altar to Tir-Cendelius
*And there, before you, stands Rhalic: a twisted old man struggling to heft his own sword. With difficulty he lifts it high, cutting down towards one of the targets, but he misses completely.*
Birds Canyon 01
This place stinks. But some of these barrels look interesting...
You had your chance!
If the Acorn doesn&apos;t catch up with us first…
Tsss. Tsss. I said that what eluded me is divinity, not the power to &lt;i&gt;kill&lt;/i&gt; divinity.
Ha! No. No, I need to stay on my own path.
I can tell the difference. It was there, alongside the gods, unlocking the same power in me that they unlocked in you.
I like a lover who likes the arts. Here we go. *ahem*... There once was a fellow called George.
[BARBARIAN] *Point to the scars that crisscross your flesh. Life is not about the marks you leave on others, but the ones they leave on you.*
So. Here we stand. Free... for now. I wonder how long it will take the demon to make thralls of us all.
Truly revolting...

Your party has been defeated...
*Tersely state that you came to his aid when he needed it. That&apos;s all that he needs to know.*
Hm? Oh. Thought you were a Magister for a moment. Can&apos;t be too careful. They&apos;re pickin&apos; us off, one by one...
Lizard Pillar
[SEBILLE] *Tell him you&apos;re looking for Lone Wolves. You have it on good authority he&apos;s the man to ask.*
It is the d-doing of Braccus Rex!
*She pauses for a moment before answering.*
Scythe
*You&apos;ve had enough gloomy chit chat; walk away.*
*A... mistake? Is he the one you&apos;ve heard of - the fallen Godwoken?*
*Agree to fight. You will become the Champion of the Arena.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Wind Clear Forest 02
*Say that in that case, you&apos;re afraid you&apos;ll have to eat him.*
The Weaver gave us a pair of silk gloves.
Undead Lizard Assassin
Poor thing. Poor fool. I hope it&apos;s an easy death, then. Decapitation! Yes, I do wish that for you. Take care, take care.
*Ask why you didn&apos;t see him before. He kind of stands out...*
*He motions the nurse to approach you. She silently asks for your hand. The Doctor nods.*
*Say you meant no offence.*
Seekers
*Tell him it&apos;s the Divine he ought to blame. Source was a beautiful power before his death.*
*The puppet stares at you with a fixed smile. No dust has settled upon its surface - it hasn&apos;t been here long.*
*The crazed Lone Wolf spirit screams and does not stop.*
[JESTER] *Note that it looks like he needs the wine cork, not the wine.*
[DWARF] *Shrug and say you&apos;ve been through worse.*
This thing... speaks to me. I know the words - but I don&apos;t know their true purpose.
*The dog follows Bruno with her eyes, consumed by thoughts of Ball.*
*Decline this battle of &apos;wits&apos; until you can do a little more research. Maybe another time.*
Still found nothing? Gods&apos; truth, we need to get out of here!
And in a dark forest on the far side of a desert, well beyond the High Seas, the Black Ring came together once more.

Please, help yourself to anything you want from our luggage. We won&apos;t need it now.
Ah, who am I kidding.
Report on the Toyseller
I find peace then. I find peace when he is &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask why Braccus cut off their heads.*
Praying Paladin
Spread Your Wings Scroll
I got all the fixin&apos;s here for every kind of bomb, grenade, missile, and shell you can imagine. Make what you want, and then let&apos;s &lt;i&gt;go!&lt;/i&gt; I got a boy to get back to.
Two-Handed Sword
*Wave your Writ of Passage in his face. He needs to leave you alone.*
Basher
Why do you shiver so? This room is temperate enough, is it not?
You understand me completely. With the needle I&apos;ll kill him, and with the needle I&apos;ll strike his name from my skin.
There, on the cliffs - ambush!
What would I do? Oh dear heart, it is not a question of &apos;would&apos;. It is a question of what &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;I do...
Herb is growing
Perhaps you keep going. Perhaps you make friends with what you see. There is a great passion in every grain of sand. Maybe you find your adventure after all.
*Tell her to get lost.*
*Despite the precariousness of your situation, you notice a flaw in her diamond features: a curiously shaped scar on her left cheek.*
May change bring out the best in us all.
Failed to create the profile directory.
&lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is our enemy. It delivered this vision to me - a threat, a promise. You &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;stop it.
[DWARF] *Tell him indeed you did: you served your queen.*
*The dwarf pulls a clinking purse from the folds of his cloak and drops it into your hand with a nod.*
Reckon I&apos;d be losing my breakfast over him, too, you hadn&apos;t come along.
MessageBox Cancel
*A feeling comes, as if from nowhere and from everywhere at once. The warmth of the King&apos;s approval, it soothes your soul. He is very proud of you.*
Free of divinity, perhaps. But life always seems to find a way of ensnaring us, one way or another.
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry, but Gwydian is dead.*
*... or instead, consume the Magister&apos;s Source.*
What in the seven hells just happened here? The Red Princess... Where has she gone?
*Your beak hammers into the earth over and over, but the ant manages to dodge each jab. You let out a squawk of frustration and resume the chase.*
Bless his heart. Please, do tell him to rest his mind. Micheil is no man of courage, but he&apos;s as loyal as a fresh-fed pup.
A large crimson gem. A galaxy of stars swirls within. The gem seems to beg to be used.
*Say there are no better lovers than lizards. It&apos;s the cold blood that makes things so... hot.*
Almost caused a bunch of my fans to rip each other to pieces... But you can trust me: I’ve got this under control.
THOU SPEAKETH THE TRUTH. DOST THOU SERVE THE VOID?
For reasons I&apos;ll not disclose right now, it is &lt;i&gt;imperative&lt;/i&gt; that I should meet with a Dreamer: one of the mystics of my kind.
A trusty shield of iron-bound wood. It won&apos;t turn any heads, but it might crack a few skulls.

Now, let&apos;s start from the starting place.
I don&apos;t take kindly to those that ignore me!
*Motion to the plants and pipes scattered about. Is there not plenty already?*
[LIZARD] *Promise him that for every dead lizard, a dozen Magisters will be slain in retribution.*
Let me take a look, then. It doesn&apos;t take long.
That&apos;s nice, Mother. But don&apos;t tell the elves.
*She lowers herself slowly, deeply, holding your gaze. Her hand is slight and warm, her touch delicate.*
Hardly. The jailor&apos;s records are clear. Five hundred and sixty four men and women were signed in - and never signed out again. I&apos;d say this was an oversight in record-keeping, but I know some of those names...
Bartering: [1]
The Advocate told us to leave Bloodmoon Island. Is he hiding something?
&lt;i&gt;But I had my own will.&lt;/i&gt;
You try.
*She nods at you curtly and turns away.*
*The spirit of a painting hovers where the painting itself once stood. The Second Passion of Lucian, you presume.*

*Fane is reading a volume of Cranley Huwbert&apos;s famous encyclopedia. He leafs through it slowly, muttering to himself.*
*Shrug. Who cares?*
You tread where you weren&apos;t invited. Off with you!
*Leave it alone.*
The dwarves ransacked a Divine Order ship recently - the &lt;i&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/i&gt;. A vessel like that is commonly used for safely transporting shipments of Deathfog...
*Reach for your weapon.*
*She takes two more steps towards you.*
A pity, that.
*The spirit&apos;s eyes dart left and right. It reaches tentatively a hand out for a moment, but thinks better of it and turns away.*
Oh. That... that would not be possible, Master Fane.
Spirit of the Blind Priestess
Light Brigandine
Yeah? Well I think you look just like my dad and he&apos;s DEAD! So what does that make you? DEAD GUY! I never wanted to play with you anyway.
Fools! They aren&apos;t even looking in the right spot! They&apos;ll never find what they want...
[JESTER] *Lean close to her ear and say... &apos;Boo!&apos;*
Magic Armour reduction
There is nothing unusual here. Be on your way.
I couldn&apos;t disagree more. Come, Quercus. We&apos;ve more important matters to attend to.
No point crying over dead bodies.
Vision of the Hall of Echoes
But beggars can&apos;t be chosers I suppose, especially when it comes to their rescuers. To whom do I owe my thanks?
Do not be fearful, kin. The Mother chooses her heir. A new Mother takes root.
Hold on a moment there, lad.
I thought the Order would get rid of any trace of the old Source king.
I wish Marg was alive so I could gloat about his death to his face.
