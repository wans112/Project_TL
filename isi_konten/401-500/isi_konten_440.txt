Execute Deadeye the Lone Wolf archer.
They stopped the process just as the last of my power drained away. Just enough to rob me of my strength, but not enough to leave me a hollow sack of flesh and scales.
Now then. Lone Wolves. I know of one: fella with the fetching name of Zaleskar.
*Ask if you may see the name.*
Forest - Abandoned Well

Psst! Careful. You have to take it when you can. She won&apos;t give you enough. Never enough.
Warrior
*Relax your body. You need your strength for whatever comes next.*
In return for Source, the lich offered to show us its cache.
I see. A little accident concerning old man Ros... and the will in my own hands. That could indeed be just the ticket. And what would be &lt;i&gt;required &lt;/i&gt;of me, if such a thing were to happen?
*So his people aren&apos;t gone? Tell him that&apos;s great news!*
I am no fool. If you can leave, you &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;leave. Free me first. Then I tell you everything I know.

You remain here? Are you so keen to see your Seeker friends meet their end in the marsh?
*Introduce yourself and tell him you&apos;re looking for a way out of Fort Joy.*
You Lone Wolves kick the shite out of me and send me into an accursed minefield where me cart gets blown up and I get killed... and all you can do is &lt;i&gt;laugh. &lt;/i&gt;*Spits.*

Shut &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, elf.
Thanks for understanding, lover-kin. Nice doing business with you, let&apos;s do it again some time.

*Whether calling down elements or calling up demons, you prefer the magical touch.*
*Ask what happens if you don&apos;t do it.*
I&apos;m tellin&apos; ya, they&apos;re just jealous. They shouldn&apos;t be complainin&apos; - they should be celebratin&apos;. A thief that can steal from the Thieves&apos; Guild? I should be their queen!
No, Godwoken... you do not... leave. &lt;i&gt;He... &lt;/i&gt;will not allow it. Here... you decay. Here... we all... decay.
*You hear a low hum. The creature is croaking a flat, tuneless drone of a song.*
Mystical Rune Frame
*An elegant lizard Lone Wolf smokes drudanae through an ornate pipe.*
It&apos;s like you read my mind. Blessings on your kin, and your kin&apos;s kin.
Take it easy, chief. You don&apos;t want to get noticed for the wrong reason.
Doctor
Do shut up, you tedious buffoon. And don&apos;t look so surprised. As if I would allow that bone-bag Dallis to enslave me. &lt;i&gt;ME?!&lt;/i&gt;
We left Fort Joy and Elodi behind.
Something hidden has been revealed! The higher your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Wits&lt;/font&gt;, the more likely you are to reveal &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;traps&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;secrets&lt;/font&gt;.

*With a smile, she propels you towards the bed. You fall backwards onto the soft mattress. She jumps on you. Kisses you.*
[SEBILLE] *Point to the scar on your neck. What he means to say is that they&apos;re &lt;i&gt;slaves.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The chest responds, but you still can&apos;t understand it. It&apos;s a lizard dialect alright, but it sounds ancient.*
I am so, so hungry. I need to feed. I need your Source.
*Apologise and beg for mercy.*
&lt;i&gt;What? &lt;/i&gt;By Duna. I mean, dwarven weddings aren&apos;t above a little bloodshed but all those... people... and right by my door. &lt;br&gt;
Goodbye, Godwoken. I would say &apos;let the best man win&apos;, but that would imply there&apos;s a contest.

[RED PRINCE] *Express your surprise that he does not recognise you.*
My child, it shall be my pleasure to assuage your worries, if I can.
