I want my mum!
*Ask just who is this God King that he speaks of.*
Ah! Well, plenty of drinks to be had when the world&apos;s saved...
*Kill him.*
Well, here we are again. You, me, and the ship I&apos;ve saved from ruin for your personal benefit. I&apos;d say you owe me, but why state the obvious.
I doubt it... No, I think they may have met with dwarves. Highwaymen.
*Shrug. That&apos;s enough storytelling for one day.*
Do you think me some moonstruck fool? Some tittering peasant impressed by the mighty Godwoken? I don&apos;t give an orc&apos;s wit for what else you need to do!
Combat Axe
Is that what you made the creatures of your land? Slaves?
*Tell her the search was going fine until you were distracted by her charms. Smile generously.*
Add-ons
Hey, mister! It&apos;s a lot nicer here than that stinking boat, huh?
How very deferential of you.
*He gets to his feet. He might not be able to see you, but he is clearly none too impressed. Or threatened.*
Oh yes, yes. Martial combat is all well and good for lesser creatures - but I&apos;m talking about the &lt;i&gt;metaphysical&lt;/i&gt;.
True story.
Turtle
*Ask after the Voidwoken. How did they get here?*
*Say it contained the usual thing sort of thing: &apos;Failure will result in death&apos;; &apos;Don&apos;t disappoint the Black Ring&apos;. All the classics.*
If you continue to reject my wisdom, I shall have no choice but to reject your company.
My... you are a special one, aren&apos;t you? That settles it then - I will join you, and I guarantee we will find use for each other in the future...
Not sure I&apos;ll forget THAT sight in a hurry.
Uh-uh, that won&apos;t do at all. This where we part. This is where I leave you in parts...
*Tell her you&apos;re used to Voidwoken by now.*
Wolfhide Armour
No more warnings. Die!
[IFAN] *Tell him you look forward to a mutually-useful friendship.*
It rises in you even now, Lohse. Do not let it. You must be strong.
Keep walking, outsider.
Failed Experiment
...once shattered, they alone descend to hell!
Ravella
*Be on your way.*
The One Has Fallen
*The spirit puffs out her chest in irritation.*
*Leave it shackled for the rest of time.*
*The creaking of the ship eases into a contemplative silence.*
*She gives you a wicked little smile and turns away.*
Spirit of Edie Engrym
&apos;Here lies an unknown ne&apos;er-do-well.&lt;br&gt;Tried to steal the wrong man&apos;s gold.&lt;br&gt;We are glad to give him rest.&apos;
Why, I say that&apos;s anything but -
Tell us, brave Tir-Cendelius... tell us what to do...
*Express your surprise. Samadel? How has she come to be here?*
*Hiss.* &lt;i&gt;You.&lt;/i&gt; Saheila says you hurt the Mother. Saheila says you betray your kin. I say you walk on. I say you walk on, or I kill you.
Very well. Do what you must.
*...everything grows dark.*
*Stand your ground. What - or who - is he guarding?*
*Kiss him and say the feeling is mutual.*
What? Nonsense. It cannot be.
Sh... shut... yer... trap. &apos;less... you want... what I... what I gave... &apos;em! Ralvo and his... his stupid &lt;i&gt;cards&lt;/i&gt;.
Your Constitution has increased!
Traitor!
Deer Head Trophy
*He lifts your veil. His eyes widen and his lips make a perfect &apos;o&apos;.*
*Accept the compliment. Allow him to kiss you. Feel the fork of his tongue push against your lips. Open your mouth to accept it.*
*Pound your chest and claim to feel the full power of his master flowing through you.*
Furnace
You! &lt;i&gt;I warn you not to follow!&lt;/i&gt;
But this? To bring us to the land of the dead? This is beyond my comprehension. She truly is a... demon.
*Tell her you don&apos;t know who Amadia is.*
Wait, before you go. This was the elf&apos;s. Take it, I don&apos;t want anything to do with it anymore.
I never thought she meant to do us wrong. I don&apos;t blame her for fleeing to the Cloisterwood. I worry for her.
&lt;i&gt;Sourc&apos;rer!&lt;/i&gt; Y&apos;must hate the Reds as much as I do, eh?
*The spirit&apos;s lip curls upwards. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but her words fade in the tomb&apos;s chill.*
*Ifan smiles and looks around, before reaching high into his sleeve and pulling out a tiny herbal wrap. The unmistakeable scent of drudanae hits you as he holds it out to you.*
So feed, for you will starve until you finally drink from the Wellspring. The Well of Ascension&apos;s Sourceflow will then swell within you!
*Ask how a fierce dragon could allow himself to be enslaved.*
Come all this way in vain. Stingtail lied. Torture victims tend to. The scar can never be undone.
*Sqffffueak! &lt;i&gt;Sqffffueak!*&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&apos;Mm, you and, you and&apos; &lt;/i&gt;- *COUGH!*
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 22: Humans
We find ourselves on an unfortunate footing: the Red Prince lives, and so too, sadly, does the Red Princess. This cannot be allowed to continue. You leave me with no choice. &lt;i&gt;Shadows!&lt;/i&gt;
We had orders from Bishop Alexandar himself. There were valuable artefacts left in this place, from the days of Braccus Rex. I can hardly fathom all the years between us and him. I can hardly fathom a day at a time.
I&apos;m going to get back to my usual work now. Maybe it&apos;ll help me take my mind off things... if you&apos;re after healing or a spot of trade, my door&apos;s always open.
*...a clearing further inland. A camp. A &lt;i&gt;Magister &lt;/i&gt;camp. They weren&apos;t supposed to be here, yet here they are - twice as many in number as you and my friends. You reach for your sword...*
*When she speaks inside your head her words have weight, as if they force themselves into your mind, whether you would let them or not.*
Magical Elven Club
Lever
Get about your business, please. No bystanders bystanding.
*Retort by pointing out he&apos;s no prince. He&apos;s nothing but a pauper, robed in rags.*
Mmmm, who are you, you lovely little specimen?&lt;br&gt;
My companion stands with me. Whatever you have to say to me, she may hear.
*He realises his mistake.*
Tell us what to do, Tir-Cendelius... lest their fear drive them to destroy us...
*Kiss him.*
|[1] makes you immune to Deathfog.|
*List for Gareth a variety of tactics as taught by teachers past. The more robust the Seekers&apos; combat repertoire, the better chance they have.*
*See what she&apos;s got for sale.*
*The lizard looks you up and down, like a farmer would a fetching horse.*
There. It&apos;s done. It&apos;s all done.
With Alexandar presumed dead, Dallis leads the Magisters.
Heal yourself and allies around you. Create a water puddle beneath every target. Remove Necrofire, Burning, Diseased, Decaying, Poisoned, Bleeding, Suffocation and Acid.
Marcus?!
I have no interest in taking a single step towards &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. All I want is to stay in the warmth of the sun - it&apos;s the only sliver of comfort I have left...
Your promises are dust! Only actions speak true, and my claws will sing with honesty.
Sacrifice the golden glitter; Melt it in the cold blue river; This paradox is magic&apos;s wonder; Believers reap the rune of thunder.
We found a child, locked catatonic in a vault beneath Bloodmoon Island. We freed her and took her on board the Lady Vengeance.
*Tell them you&apos;re just passing through.*
Reduce target&apos;s Physical Armour by [1], set Acid.
I know this isn&apos;t lookin&apos; so good, but you got to trust me when I tell you the queen&apos;s no friend of mine. Not no more.
*Argue that even if you and Sadha were to have children, that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the prophecy will come true.*
*Tell them you need to think about it.*
I didn&apos;t begrudge you your freedom. Your escape relieved me of having to witness your death by your own hand: the inevitable last command.
In a few moments, I dare say you will discover that information firsthand.
It&apos;s a curse to be a great man&apos;s son, you know. Truly a curse.

You celebrate too early.
When you become the Divine there &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;no more self.
Loh... se...
That was... awesome. What a show of Source. You&apos;d give Hannag a run for her money!
[This manuscript about the elven god Tir-Cendelius is - or was - clearly in progress.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tir-Cendelius, the Poet, made the woodlands his domain and guided the elves to grow and prosper, blessing them with near-immortality and wisdom. From him, the elves inherited their haughty charm and intense need to chronicle the events of the world as they develop.
*She gives you a steady, defiant stare. A spark of recognition lights up her eyes but is gone in a flash.*
May you choke on my heart, heretic.
*Turn away.*
Right.
*Insist it was no problem. No thanks are necessary.*
I think it&apos;s *gasp* I think it&apos;s getting tighter. Don&apos;t you feel it? Is it only mine?
Neep? Neep eep.
I could then craft a mask to hide my bone, but as I lack such a tool...
From &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt; Simple fool! Do you think &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;tolerate a death&apos;s head coming to aid them? I tried to help so many, but all screamed. All fought. All drove me away.
Exiled from the Ancient Empire, the taciturn &apos;Red Prince&apos; is searching for a lizard dreamer. We shall travel together.
Arrow and magic projectiles will fly through your companions without harming them, but explosions and area effects will affect everyone.
We could make the silver lever at the enchanted forge.
And I would rather like to be sitting atop a mountain of gold - so give me the will and perhaps we will both get what we want.
Fane&apos;s Mask of the Shapeshifter
The One wouldn&apos;t. The One would be humble, just like you.
Be at ease, Magister Roe! Weapons down!
Magister Krendt
You are back! So you are ready. You are ready to tell me your tale. And you tell me now.
Bein&apos; dead&apos;s not very special. I&apos;m more impressed that ye can talk to me.
*Peek inside the bag. Quite a lot of good gear in there. Who did they say it belonged to?*
Drink or shut up.
Oh! Nothing to see here!
Steel Armour
They&apos;re called Shriekers. Upon sight, they blast passersby with Source so powerful none can withstand it. Instant death - that is guaranteed.
Well I&apos;m sure any discomfort will pass shortly. Besides, I&apos;ve learned a great deal from observing you - I&apos;m in your debt, stranger!
*He squints at you and laughs. Looking closer, you see the man is wearing a very obvious fake beard. Behind the atrocious fox hair, you recognise the mischievous twinkling eyes of a Lone Wolf: Callo!*
Kill... him...
He is not of this world, lizard. In flesh, he cut away my tongue. In spirit, he... he will do much worse. I know it!
Temple of Rhalic
[IFAN] *Bow. It is true. The elves have suffered too much - &lt;i&gt;far &lt;/i&gt;too much.*
Ifan&apos;s target is none other than Bishop Alexandar himself!
Feh! Fend for yourself then, big momma. I&apos;ll take what I want after the Reds get to you, anyway.
...and this is only the beginning. Together, we can unlock even greater powers within you.
Ruse? Oh honey. It was just a nibble, not a mist of Deathfog. I took only what I asked for, and gave you the gift I promised.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Tell her you can&apos;t lie to her; what you feel for her isn&apos;t quite love.*
*The spirit resists - she bombards you with memories of everything but the dreamers and to where they escaped.*
&lt;i&gt;Let go. You need them no longer. We are One.&lt;/i&gt;
For you. My ring. Part of me. Name of Migo. Thank you.
Then they brought us here. I couldn&apos;t stop &apos;em from taking my boys from me when they did. Reckon they were cured, maybe even released. Dunno why the Reds didn&apos;t take me too.
High-yield aerial immolation imminent!
And soon... soon you will be torn to pieces.
