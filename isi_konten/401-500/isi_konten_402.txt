*The Magister trembles and wails, receiving no respite from the dreamer.*
That is what I am led to believe. And what I now seek to find...
You&apos;re on my nerves. Move it. I don&apos;t tell you again.
Pressure Plates
Seven curse these fiends! A lifetime of dreams... For nothing!
...if you do something for me first. Quid pro quo, I&apos;m afraid. A tad vulgar of me, that much I admit, but needs must when the demon drives.
*The spirit shoots you a venomous look, unimpressed by your offer.*
*He casts a long glance up and down your bedraggled form.*
*Tell him you know nothing of his family&apos;s fate.*
*She closes her eyes in terror...*
An unseen force protects the lever. What hinders us so?
*Address the second speaker. Who or what is it? Some sort of trapped demon?*
*Lohse yawns and stretches, arching her whole body like a cat. She folds into you, her head on your chest, arm draped around your body.*
*This isn&apos;t normal? Ask why it&apos;s happening.*
*Snap that you&apos;re not going to die just so some ancient race can come back. You didn&apos;t ask to be created, but you&apos;re here now, and you&apos;ll fight to survive.*
Want is a dangerous word. Want implies desire. We tend to do far too much to get what we crave. No-one knows this better than your demon.
White Magister Jonathan
Bit of a radical weapon, Deathfog. Not much point in ruling over lands inhabited only by the dead.
*Give him ten seconds to tell you where your stolen gear is or he&apos;s a dead man.*
Yes, and had my mask not been stolen, you would still not see me. I could be an elf, a dwarf, a... tall dwarf?
For this, there can be no redemption.
*Give him a fake name.*
Trice
You are not easily seduced, even by those you &lt;i&gt;should &lt;/i&gt;be able to trust.

My master has use for you. Make haste, if you please.
It&apos;s not right to press on without the one who helped me out of Fort Joy.
&lt;i&gt;That&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; what I&apos;m looking for, that crusader courage. The courage to stand up for what&apos;s &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;.
You must have known this day would come?
You can fight alone, but you don&apos;t have to; all kinds of allies might be eager to join your party.
I&apos;ve heard his name once or twice. He&apos;s in - how would you say? - the import-export business. Old-school royalist. Revolution&apos;s not exactly good for commerce, after all.
Witch&apos;s Cellar Key
There is a thin line between a hero and busybody meddling in other people&apos;s business. Be wary of that line.
No, you bloody well shouldn&apos;t have, you shameless little...
Initiative determines turn order. During combat, teams take turns attacking. Individuals with higher initiative will move up in turn order.
And what kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
I was &lt;i&gt;born &lt;/i&gt;for this duty - as long as he lived, my father groomed me to take his place, to speak for the Gods...
But such a thing requires the utmost trust, and there&apos;s no-one here in whom I can place it.

But let&apos;s not discuss the Change just yet. Stingtail stung too soon. Right now we must ensure your safety. Should you perish, the Change perishes with it.
Deep Freeze Scroll
*Lying at your feet is a strange lamp of ancient design. Spots of gold shimmer through the thick grime that coats it.*
*The Magister balks, all bravado punctured. She hums a tune and looks the other way, pretending to be completely alone here.*
Firestorm Grenade
*With a susurrating hiss, the urn reaches into your thoughts. You realise you can choose to bring a beloved pet back into your life.*
*Shake your head. You will have divinity, even if you have to fight her for it.*
Is this what heroism is? Leavin&apos; the kingdom without a queen? Are they... really better off than before? *Sigh* Maybe she was right. My blood is hot. I don&apos;t think this shite through.
Slippery little devil, ain&apos;t yeh...
Armoire
Hrrmm... I don&apos;t know yet. Perhaps peace will reign and all will be equal... or perhaps you&apos;ve bestowed great power on undeserving &lt;i&gt;children &lt;/i&gt;and turned them loose on each other...
*The altar stands before you, flecked with moss and the cracks of age. An ant crawls across the surface, dipping in and out of the inscription that&apos;s engraved on the rock.*
How precious you are. This&lt;i&gt; is &lt;/i&gt;my element.
Well, we made a pact, didn&apos;t we, Quercus?
He will be judged and sentenced as soon as he is found. Sir Reimond wants to show the world what happens to those who oppose the Magisters.
...Fane.
Day
Gratiana may know more about the Purging Wand.
Walk away then. I&apos;d expect nothing less from someone as stupid and mean as you.
We met a boy called Han, who was looking for someone named Verdas, but arrived too late. This &apos;Verdas&apos; was likely the tortured Sourcerer that Vasnya told us about.
Captain&apos;s Tattered Log
*Wait- what words? Ask what it&apos;s talking about.*
On Bloodmoon Island we defeated the envoy of an extremely powerful demon. This may have consequences. Demons tend to be unforgiving.
*Before you go, ask what exactly he did to your eyes.*
No, these laws stretch to infinity. Understanding them lets you understand the world.
She murdered children! She cannot be forgiven.
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry he had to go through that.*
We left the burning consulate behind us.
Hurry along now; you need to find Dallis before it&apos;s too late.
Well, look at you, all noble! I can&apos;t promise that your sacrifice will fill my belly. But if it sates me, I won&apos;t seek more.
This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; vengeance! The one who forced you to kill wants all Scions dead. If you become the mother, new Scions rise and he is defeated!
Let&apos;s discuss our respective roles then, shall we?
*The vision is cut short. Your consciousness is thrust violently from the past to the present, leaving you briefly dazed.*
You... you help...?
Target is Marked, decreasing its ability to Dodge. Prevents target from going invisible.
Argh! You&apos;re impossible!
*Say that you found Gareth out in the swamps... but he didn&apos;t make it.*
*Ask him where to find the culprit.*
Magister Carver&apos;s got all the information he needs locked up downstairs, so don&apos;t think you&apos;ll get a reward for peddling hearsay.
Ssshhhhh... I&apos;m trying to get out here!
Well sure. Sure I do. I&apos;m a fletcher. Damn good one, actually. That&apos;s why I&apos;m here. Roost forced me to work for him.
Boy oh boy. Sorry I asked!
the day the God King returns!
I&apos;m not going to press the matter, then. But do be diligent out there.
His soul is mine and so is yours. &lt;i&gt;His soul is mine and so is yours. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!&lt;/i&gt;
When she knocked, we figured it must be time. The Order had come for me. But it wasn&apos;t a Magister who&apos;d called. Not then, anyway. It was a lizard.
*Tell him you&apos;re not going anywhere without a damned good explanation of &lt;i&gt;why.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you don&apos;t.*
Very good, ma&apos;am.
Does it matter? I b-b-beg you! Help!
[VILLAIN] *Urge Ryker to continue. You can feel the Source rising in you. You will take what&apos;s yours!*
*Ask if you might see her wares.*
*She turns away from you and continues polishing the glass, eyes darting quickly around the bar, focusing on nothing.*
Breaking the seal on the blazing statue revealed a hidden vault.
One who can either rise to this great task... or let his people fall to ruin.
Voidwoken! How unappetising.
These are tense times. Is there something you wanted?
Dallis and her White Magisters were up to something in the barracks. Kemm does not yet know what.
Of course I will. Surely you know by now you&apos;re my favourite.
Wait a moment... you&apos;re... you&apos;re...

Touchy subject, I did warn you.
And the Seven were punished for their transgression.

*Amadia throws her arms up to defend herself, but invisible blows rain down from all around. She rolls from her bed, tearing the curtain from the window in a panic, revealing a cool moon outside.*
That&apos;s really not how this is supposed to work.
[Translate41_8d3c7d03-b0e8-47f5-ab34-a6ee31b60a17]
*Say you heard about the Voidwoken attack. What happened?*
Return to the island, Lohse, and listen. Listen for the key to your salvation.
Well if it ain&apos;t so-and-so! Ha - I&apos;m just kiddin&apos;, princey-poo. We&apos;re good together, like sea salt &apos;n&apos; taties, or jam on sweetbread. Y&apos;care to team up? I&apos;d say your stew could use a bit of Beastly flavour, if ya catch my meanin&apos;.
I can still teach you how to bolster your strength, Godwoken. Just be warned that your wits will suffer slightly.
Guard Protector
*Say you&apos;ll think about it.*
*He&apos;s right, best to stay out of the water.*
Ah, the stew... it&apos;s much in demand.
There&apos;s no need to go upsetting them, so hold your tongue!
Indeed you do. All Godwoken do. But it is not for the Knight of Tir-Cendelius to reveal such things.

We continued on our journey, leaving the girl and her demon behind.
Balance Offer
[NOBLE] *Now that you&apos;re up, you&apos;d like to bathe and dine. Tell her to ring for the servants.*
*Show him the gloves you found. A White Magister&apos;s, surely.*
...and combs it out all dilly-eye day.
*A tall woman stands amid a field of corpses, some fresh, some ancient. The sour smell of them stings your nostrils, your eyes. As you draw nearer, the stench blooms into a humid flavour you can almost taste.*
*He kicks the edge of the bridge, sending a sizable chunk of rock flying perilously close to your eye.*
*Her eyes narrow.*
So... the Gods are liars. I can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised.
Loading failed: Level [1] not found
He&apos;s a wily one. He wriggles into your head like a worm through an apple. I wish I&apos;d known. I wish I &lt;i&gt;could&apos;ve&lt;/i&gt; known.
Fane refused the God King&apos;s Covenant. Choosing between his friends and his people can&apos;t have been easy.
I need it. I need it. I need it.
I told you already - he wasn&apos;t responsible. This won&apos;t change anything... more will vanish.
Walk away then. I&apos;d expect nothing less from someone as crazy as you are.
*It looks at you with its cold flat eyes as if to say &apos;do what you will&apos;. Then it turns away and gets back to drowning in the bloody sunshine.*
This brew is said to make your eyes bright, your skin clear and your hair scented like exotic flowers. Whatever it actually does, there&apos;s no denying that people act more favourably towards the drinker.
*The terrible vision fades...*
CAKAW! I THINK NOT!
Reduces the damage from earth-based attacks.

*Tell him you see the problem: Sourcerers distrust the Magisters. Grin and offer to remove the Magisters from the situation...*
*Tell her you knew her husband. He&apos;s... dead now.*
I denied the Red Prince his union with Sadha. Lizards attacked, trying to force them together! Sadha vanished, and the Prince is sulking.
Sing us a song, I know you can!
*Ask what he&apos;s doing here.*
*The Magister takes the ring from you.*
Before her execution, Magister Atusa refused to name her accomplices. Who are these dissidents?
*Force the voice out of your mind. It is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; domain.*
We found Sech Zapor&apos;s Soul Jar inside Braccus Rex&apos;s vault. It&apos;s clear he once worked for the tyrant.
*While he&apos;s distracted, sneak up behind the dwarf and slit his throat.*
Godspeed, and remember, do &lt;i&gt;whatever &lt;/i&gt;it takes.
*She flutters her eyelashes in exaggerated coquettishness, her blush deepening.*
Hah. Thus speak the most heinous offenders of us all.
