Well... whatever helps you sleep at night.
Grog the troll asked us to get rid of his competitor, Marg. And Grog&apos;s bridge toll is extortionate...
*The spirit of a Magister priestess swipes her staff in wide arcs through the air. She turns and spots something...*
*Say you are always free to do as you choose.*
*Hastily change your mind and accept her offer.*
[DWARF] *Chuckle that nothing stops a dwarven wedding party. Nothing. Then ask what else is happening.*

*Gloat, for you may be cursed, but she is still dead.*
Spirit of the Constitution Master
The trail led into the sewers.
Ifan was tricked into killing the elves. Alexandar regrets nothing.
Cursed Blood
*You can&apos;t trust him. Leave him where he is.*
*The spirit of an elven woman holds her palms upward; a hesitant, peacemaking gesture... she steps forward...*
Door
Then you couldn&apos;t possibly understand.
Take a hike, longshanks. Me and your belly button ain&apos;t got nothing to talk about.
You look... strange. And we already got more o&apos; that than we need around here.
*Kari&apos;s face remains defiantly still.*
*Swear you won&apos;t let her near him.*
You&apos;re fun. I like you.
Of course, the Paladins were the first recruits of Lucian. So, many saw the Magisters rising through the ranks as a threat to &lt;i&gt;their &lt;/i&gt;Order. &apos;Pig farmers leading Lords,&apos; they said.
Please, end my suffering!
Bock!
*Choke back your resentment and prepare to disembowel this freak.*
*Tell her you can talk to her boss about the sewers, or you can talk to the Paladins.*
*The door makes no sound and reveals no mysteries.*
Y-you... you&apos;ll help us?
*Your gold disappears from your hand. She reaches into the folds of her dress and produces a vial - the vial of your blood. But she does not return it... she holds it up to you.*
*Approach Sebille, take her hand, and ask if she would like to spend the night with you.*
Tuft of Cat Fur
&apos;course I am, Ma! Are you?
*The statue looms in the shadowy darkness of the cave. A clear aura of sadness shrouds its stony face. At first, you think it&apos;s crying. A closer look shows the welling tears to be water dripping from the cave ceiling.*
*He leans in, and your lips ever so lightly meet.*
Explosives. And we&apos;re locked in with them.
*Reach out and rest your hand against the jar.*
I know you. I know your scars. I&apos;ll rip apart your scars.
Mordus scratched out a living, ending up as a short-order cook. After an epiphany arising from the phrase &apos;sunny side up&apos;, he started a religion. Upon his death from food poisoning all three of his followers committed suicide.
Wings
Please, do whatever you can to help!
*Next, a hard slap across your cheek with the flat of her hand.*
*Nod your head. You actually agree: you&apos;re just a pawn of higher deities.*
Activate Encounter
*Say you predict chaos - utter chaos.*
*The spider spindles right up to you, her long, long legs tickling the sandy floor. A malevolent intelligence gleams forth from eight beady eyes. She opens her mouth and hisses at you.*
the dwarves led the Alliance in the battle against the God King.
Your efforts are useless, Godwoken!
*Tell him you never asked for this. This is about his own lust for power now. And you&apos;ll not surrender.*
Your eyes betray the guilt of the human race. You believe it your right to ravage Rivellon. &lt;i&gt;What say you?&lt;/i&gt;
*Turn on Gareth. Does he even hear himself? Has he gone mad?*
*Creak...* Discipline is paramount.
Nope. Not getting through.
Ah, now you feel her touch. Now, Lady Luck sings in your blood as she once did in mine. And now, I feel... &lt;i&gt;nothing.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you you&apos;d like to talk to her about the two of you.*
Changes Incarnate&apos;s element to poison, unlocking Poison Dart.
*No, you absolutely do not.*
*Insist, with all sincerity, that you know &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;what you&apos;re doing.*
*Amadia stretches out and nourishes herself from the Source that abounds in your presence. You feel it, deep down inside yourself, as it drains away.*
You mean kill her...? But you said you wanted to help!
Mordus&apos;s Hammer
*Alright, you say, you&apos;ll see what you can do.*
*Look him up and down. Tell him... he need not worry about you.*
That accursed bell lies with the Peacemaker, on the bottom in the rocky shallows. My compass lies there too. And there they&apos;ll stay, for all I care. My time here is done.
Hidden in Kemm&apos;s vault lies an altar to the God King!
Well I can, but some filther bugger stole my lute! Surely you could give it a shot without accompaniment, right?
Now if you&apos;ll recall, as per your own testimony you can tailor, but alas you&apos;ve no culinary skills and you&apos;ve little or no regard for personal hygiene. Far from ideal.
My soul jar waits in the hills. Each taste of living Source is like a healing salve. When I am full, I can finally open the reliquary that holds it.
Oh, you&apos;re back! Looking for some treasures and trinkets?
*Shake your head and say you had no idea such horror came with her scarring.*
The burning doesn&apos;t end!
*Explain that you know Fort Joy well. Lovely beaches! Nasty dungeons...*
I warn you twice. I have no more patience!
Poor Exter worships Gareth. He&apos;s lost without him. We all are...
*Alexandar must live. He is the key to this conflict. Prepare to defend him from Gareth.*
These... they were people who were &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt;. It&apos;s not right to butcher them like cattle.
This character is important to your origin story, so you have returned to your authentic appearance to talk with them.
*Lohse doesn&apos;t move. She stands back, tall and calm.*
*You couldn&apos;t imagine it possible, but the spirit&apos;s scorn only grows. Ryker may be silent, but his feelings are hardly secret.*
[UNDEAD] *Tell her she&apos;s beautiful... but you can&apos;t do it.*
You&apos;re no stranger then, to her demon-wrought idiosyncrasies.
And only his Soul Jar can turn his head, now.
No... no... &lt;i&gt;no...&lt;/i&gt;
Soothing Cold
Piss off, wouldya?
*The leaves of the altar rustle, a gentle murmur on the breeze. You feel calm, despite the low growls of the tiger standing beside you.*
Moo! Delicious, but that doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;ll be chewing the cud whenever you so please.
Hello, hello! So? Do you recognise me now, or shall I give you a little hint?
Ally has leadership [1]
The air is thick with blood. Someone must have angered Amadia.
Is there more on your mind?
Bones need not be broken. Screams need not rend this old air. Preserve thyself, and flee.
But I do wish you good luck. And perhaps we meet again. Some day.
Source-Muted. Can&apos;t cast.&lt;br&gt;
I was raised immediately after my death; I never had the chance to see what wonders await the true dead.
*The Red Prince. He&apos;s alive?*
My task was to protect secrets, not to interpret them. But let me say this - the notion that we would have anything to do with the Black Ring is absurd - &lt;i&gt;patently &lt;/i&gt;absurd!
*The spirit is dressed in tattered ceremonial garb. Eagle feathers tangle in his beard, and bird droppings decorate his robes. He surveys the circling flock with evident satisfaction.*
*Say he reminds you of the humans you met a millennium ago, back before elves and humans freely mixed.*
We agreed to help Withermoore. A switch on the courtyard statue leads to the Phylactery Room and his Soul Jar.
Shields
A character with [1] moves at normal speed while sneaking.
Lock Chat Background
You still need to face him. You still need to best him. But you can do it, especially with allies like this at your side. Of that I have no doubt - &lt;i&gt;none.&lt;/i&gt;
Actually, you don&apos;t seem half as threatening as those creatures in red. Run along, won&apos;t you? I have business to attend to.
You can see the souls of the dead. And now you can &lt;i&gt;feed&lt;/i&gt; from them to your hungry heart&apos;s content.
Off to Fort Joy with you, Sourcerer! We&apos;re gonna help you!
Those slimes were disgusting!
Sebille supported my claim on Divinity.
Moving to hazardous concoction generator!
Looks like Kemm&apos;s locked this hatch, on top of submerging it. He must have a lot to hide.
*At the mention of Lohar, she narrows her eyes, suspicious...*
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present to you the Seed of Divinity: the Beast.
Spirit of a Pilgrim
I cannot help you. I only give the questions - I do not answer them.
...and then a flask of whiskey for the trail.
There&apos;s ones like you close by, the Seekers. I came here with them, but Magisters sank their ship.
*The Path of Blood sounds... dangerous. Ask who created this trial.*
*Tell her not to worry; this will all be over soon. She can kick that dour dinner guest to the curb.*
So I was, but what have I to show for my efforts? I supported your bid for divinity, but it came to naught.
*Tell him that even if you had, you&apos;re in no hurry to help the likes of &lt;i&gt;him.*&lt;/i&gt;
The Mother is sick. She is weak. Her grip slips at last. You make her so. You kill her Scions. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are strong now, Sebille. You are Prime Scion. You are Godwoken.
Rex
*Say that couldn&apos;t happen again; this time, the jailors as well as the prisoners would be Sourcerers.*
*Clench your fists.*
The Sourcerer King from times of yore, Braccus Rex, had a twin. What was her name...?
Rotating minimap
Fortunately the Magisters pay as much attention to art as they do fashion.
Epic
I&apos;ll wake up in a minute - Wainslow&apos;s snoring always wakes me. &lt;i&gt;This can&apos;t be real!&lt;/i&gt;
*Thank him and wish him well.*
The Umbral Statue seems to be protecting the possessed dwarves...
Now that I believe.
Freezing Arrowhead
Heavy is the head that wears the crown. But I&apos;ve no doubt at all you&apos;ll do well by the title.
*Step back from the lock.*
These finely-stitched boots show the marks of Dwarven Empire labour, each whorl in the leather a rune telling the family lineage of their owner: Anhar, son of Lohar.
*Refuse him, saying you kneel before no man.*
Sleeping Man
*Click* *Click* Click*
We released the ship from its bonds. In gratitude, it will take us wherever we need to go.
*Say that if you&apos;re to become a Master of the Source, surely there is no better tutor than herself.*
But as for &lt;i&gt;using&lt;/i&gt; it, that was all Lucian and Alexandar. I was there when they made the decision. I stood by while they took action. Lucian knew &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;what he was doing.
That was before the Voidwoken, wasn&apos;t it. Our kind stopped using Source for the greater good. Your kind&apos;s holding on as stubborn as ever...
From the desk of Dallis herself, a draft letter regarding a &apos;mistake&apos; made by the Seekers.
Greetings, Scion. Saheila says you shall save us. Saheila says you shall save the elves. You give us hope. Thank you.
*Ask what the hell is going on.*
But it was not always thus. This marsh was once a rich, lush land. Before &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;came. Before Braccus.
Radius: [1]
*Remind Gareth of how often he quotes Lucian. What would the late Divine have him do now?*
If you think you&apos;re marching us to our deaths, you&apos;ve another thing coming, bud.
*Suck out the spirit&apos;s Source. Ryker deserves no better.*
He is the judge - and he has condemned your kind. I smell the stench of your guilt with every Gods-damned breath you take!
