*The spirit offers a stoic nod, accepting his fate.*
*He hears you as you step forward, and lets out a cackle.*
Sorry you&apos;re upset, ma&apos;am. But we all wear what we wear for a reason.
Tremble
Magister Brianna
Return me to true waters, and I shall take you wherever you wish.
We killed the Magisters.
That ain&apos;t like him. Lucky you.
*She kisses your lips. Then your forehead. Then each cheek. Your chin. Your neck. The crown of your head.*
[RED PRINCE] *Look at him in disgust and say you&apos;re worried of catching more than his drift standing this close.*
Well! Then we&apos;ll have to think of something else, won&apos;t we.
Bandit Lizard Ranger
*The Magister gasps, grimacing and squeezing his arm as the curse wriggles through his veins.*
You cannot hurry the One. Patience does not come easy, however.

What are you waiting for, my lord? The experience of a lifetime awaits upstairs, and the door to you is open.
You there, demon daughter. A word!
The Gods choose &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;as their champion. Some bones past their prime.
[BARBARIAN] *Bare your teeth and growl. You are as hungry for battle as the beast is for flesh.*
Our consulate lies in ruins! A day of celebration has become a day of catastrophe! I see the horrors still, floating afore my eyes.
Well, that&apos;s that settled. &lt;i&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/i&gt;
Shackled! Character will receive damage when the caster gets damaged.
*Snap*
*Ask to solve the riddles that you may open the doors.*
I&apos;d remember him. I&apos;d honour him with vengeance. His name was the first, but many more followed.
Investigate the elf and her captive.
*Relent; tell her to go ahead, if it means that much to her.*
The Sssallow Man awaitsss. &lt;i&gt;Use the mirror.&lt;/i&gt;
The Seekers were once part of the Order, my friend.
Smelling faintly of horse dung, this well-oiled key hangs from a threadbare ribbon.

Orcs? Puppets. Creatures of the Void? Dolls. For the Enchanter, enemies are more toys than threats, and battle is equal parts play and experimentation. Raised by dedicated natural philosophers, the Enchanter grew up believing the less-desirable races were profoundly important. A living orc could be experimented upon in ways one would never dream of applying to a human, after all. Trained to assist in capturing and controlling these test subjects, the Enchanter&apos;s expertise is unparalleled. What those natural philosophers didn&apos;t expect, however, was for their well-trained Enchanter to realise the horror of their experiments and to turn that expertise against them. The Source Hunters who pulled them down from the spikes upon which they&apos;d been compelled to impale themselves offered the Enchanter a choice: Rot in jail, or turn those powers of manipulation toward the greater good.
Dungeon - Treasury
How could this happen? Did the Voidwoken take &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; from me too?
[Translate76_ba31a68b-b67f-445c-8c29-30ace1d74467]
I&apos;ve got to admit - I&apos;m all about returnin&apos; the power to the people, but I never could&apos;ve seen this one comin&apos;!
Right. Tick-tock.
*Tell her it&apos;s too childish for you anyway.*
You&apos;re not going any further, elf.
Malicious or not, she is now allied with an unknowable evil. All of the God King&apos;s servants must die - including Sadha.
*Beg her pardon. You were speaking out of frustration.*
That won&apos;t help. She&apos;s... really scary.
Please... leave me alone.
You were slaves under the Seven, and you did not yearn for freedom.
Isn&apos;t power reason enough? It is for me. Although I admit, it would solve... other problems. Damian. The Black Ring. The world has its ailments. We are the cure! My friend, you are almost a doctor!
Is that correct?

I chose to support Lucian. May the new Divine do right by my people - and all of Rivellon.
IT&apos;S EATING ME! IT&apos;S - &lt;i&gt;AAARGH!&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;kay then... *ahem*...
Vo Charlen
*He nods at the table, then does a double-take and shrugs. It seems your effects &lt;i&gt;used &lt;/i&gt;to be there, but someone has swiped them.*
You know what you must do, Lohse. There is no other way.
*Humour him. Let&apos;s see where this leads.*
But Lyn and Conway are not here. You take their names from Magister lips to use against me!
Trailing Boots
Haha! Of course not. Not you. You&apos;re an &lt;i&gt;independent&lt;/i&gt;, right?
Don&apos;t worry about me, I&apos;ll survive just fine alone. Worry about your own hide...
Doubt he&apos;ll be drawin&apos; me a map direct to Justinia, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re hoping. Though you never know what I could convince him to do, given my winning personality.
Peach
*Instead, you sink to your knees. He&apos;s not leaving. Not yet. Not ever. And this feels... good.*
*Gratiana? Do they mean the priestess that you met in the sanctuary?*
That&apos;s right, my darling. I&apos;m here with you.
*She rises from her bow. The deep blue veins on her face pulse violently.*
The Archive bears knowledge of dark powers. Few of us were ever allowed to enter that place.
Always business to take care of.
Well... that&apos;s that sorted, I suppose.
You returned to the world as one more elf among many. Your future was yours to decide. Did you accept your new status with humility, or did you rebel?
*Say nothing and raise your weapon. Braccus Rex must never again reign.*
Malady. The Seekers. They said you and I had something in common. That we&apos;re... well, we&apos;re...
[JESTER] *Say a ham sandwich would be great.*
Oh no!
At last, this journey is almost done.
*Tell him to piss off or put &apos;em up.*
*Turn and walk away.*
Just a friendly little poisonous toadstool, minding its own business.
Drag items you wish to buy or sell onto the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;barter&lt;/font&gt; window. Balance the offer by pressing the scales. Confirm the transaction by pressing the red accept button. You can also &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;identify and repair items&lt;/font&gt; at a trader.
...Oh Quercus, I am not talking down to it! Quite literally the opposite, in fact.
Thank you. And I wish you good fortune as well. You&apos;ve come a long way; fought hard.
What? The bloody cook...? It can&apos;t be! Why did Higba have that contraband then...?
The letter to Mordus mentioned a ritual: &apos;Mord&apos;Akaim&apos;. It sounds ominous.
Smart lad.
*Confront her. She must not intrude in your mind uninvited.*
Dallis? Here? I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about. Those searching the magister barracks might know something, but I certainly haven&apos;t seen &lt;i&gt;the Hammer&lt;/i&gt; here...
[IFAN] *Advance upon him, weapon drawn: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Do you think my soul is pure as theirs? You will be disappointed...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*The rat closes its eyes and sits there trembling.*
Having performed the greatest act of necromancy in history, Tarquin found the new world... unchallenging. He became obsessed with rumours of another plane of existence.  One day he vanished, and was never seen again.
Please, undead one. Go.
Shadow
If you secure a loan with blood, it gets repaid one way or another.
*As if waking from a dream, he turns to you, disoriented. Hesitantly, he drops his fist until it hangs loosely by his side. Sheepish now, he scratches the side of his head with his other hand.*
*The glowing corpse looks to you. The erratic rising and falling of its sternum is accompanied by melodramatic gurgles.*
*Tell him you haven&apos;t hit rock bottom yet...*
*So... ask Ifan what&apos;s up with that guy wearing the fake moustache in the tavern.*
*Beast&apos;s eyes grow wide as your lips touch his - and suddenly you are at sea, lost in that sumptuous beard, and rocking to the rhythm of the waves. You pull out of the kiss and the vision...*
*Tell her because she failed a spell-ing test.*
Consider me moved, Godwoken. Your mercy is boundless.
[ELF] *Say you&apos;re just another elf, like her. Maybe a less temperamental one.*
Ball and Chain
Pay attention! *Sigh* A shame they become so... &lt;i&gt;docile&lt;/i&gt;.
Mantle of Magic
We found the dead hero Vydia&apos;s treasure in the Blackpits.
*Mmm...*
*From rope tethered to withered branches, a disfigured body sways. What was once a fearsome god has been reduced to nothing more than twisted limbs and lifeless eyes dripping tears of Source.*
*Turtle Johnny puts an invisible Source collar on Mary-Laine.*
I know I can trust you. I see it before my eyes.
My name is Sadha. I thought you knew.
A foul creature, locked away for his crimes. Who he is - what he has done - these are not relevant. All that matters is that you are presented with an opportunity.
Destruction follows in your wake, I&apos;ve noticed. Luckily, I&apos;ve got a fix for that!
There&apos;s been a steady stream of reports flying in about a Sourcerer matching your description getting into all kinds of trouble. Let me say, I hope you&apos;re not bringing it here with you...
Seriously, I need your help. A blast of the old magic will sort me right out.
*No doubt whatsoever remains: Sebille is a goddess, and she&apos;s kissing you.*
*Nod at the squirrel - it sounds like he&apos;s being diligent, at least.*
Your Godwoken has asked you a question. Answer him.
*Point out that by hiding in your soul, he&apos;s turned you into a target for every Voidwoken in the world.*

Carson, The Snickering One
*He squints at you, and when he realises what&apos;s about to happen, he looks... disappointed in you.*
F6
*Tell her to back off; you have a deal with Griff.*
We never found the Thieves&apos; Guild.
*Ask just what is this &apos;Covenant&apos;?*
*Remark that it is good to see her. The Lady Vengeance has been a dependable ally.*
It may not be possible.
To the Orc Temple
This character is a spirit.
I notice you&apos;ve got a few scrapes and scratches. Causing trouble in the area, are you?
*Search her for details of this mysterious friend...*
*Ask how it works.*
Excuse me, I have paying customers to serve. Paying customers with actual money.
*As you touch her, the blood transfers to your hands. It drips to the ground, running rivulets into the red, sodden earth. But the statue herself is now gleaming and burnished, a thing apart.*
Empathy
My husband was always careful to be too busy to attend - clearly he had no time for meeting with honest, righteous folk.
Elven Civilian
You&apos;ll have to do better than that to buy my silence.
*Admit that some of Arhu&apos;s records point to at least one potential suspect.*
The fantatic seeks only to corrupt you. Were it not for his wicked devotion, the Devourer&apos;s power would have never spread.
Goodbye, Red Prince. I will see you from the shadows.
[VILLAIN] *Chuckle. Pull down your collar to reveal your throat: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Come on then.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Not quite wrong. Not quite right.
*Do as she says.*
Dead Bandit
Barrels
It- it were a breastplate! Some spore killed one of your kin and it... it &lt;i&gt;grew&lt;/i&gt; out of him.
*You cut him open with heart pounding gusto. Stingtail&apos;s organs are birthed through the gaping wound and land with a wet splash.*
So, er... here we are.
We are no fools... We understood the game the lizards were playing.  But... the Divine protects the realm at &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;costs, no matter how high. And the Black Ring threatened to destroy us all.
*You flit into a cluster of tall shrubs and ready your dagger, but she has already stepped through the portal, leaving you alone in this unlikely oasis. You step out of cover and reach to the portal. What awaits beyond it?*
Yeah... no. No idea. Sorry.
We sailed from Reaper&apos;s Coast, leaving the rumours in the Black Bull tavern behind.
A brutal warrior will ascend. We&apos;ll celebrate this hero as the One.
