*You croak out a last plea - to be burned in the lizard tradition - but it only comes out as an unintelligible squeak. The human frowns in confusion. Everything goes dark.*
Brother Bire
*The air goes suddenly, eerily still - then breaks, a flash of heat hitting your face like fire.*
Leave me be, brother.
Be well, Lohse. Good-bye.
Mmmm. Tender, juicy... much better than the stale old muck Ryker pushes through my boudoir door.
I spent a lot of time aboard Magister ships when I served under Lucian, and I can tell you the best spots for the seasick are below decks. Not that I... urgghh... excuse me...
*Look sexy.*
*Yank Beast away from her. That&apos;s enough!*
[DWARF] *Chant an ancient prayer of comfort. &apos;Wherever wandering souls may roam, Duna safely guide them home.&apos;*
*Ask if you can help banish the demon that plagues his former patient.*
I was destined to become the next emperor, but my ambitions suffered a bit of a setback when I fell from grace for cavorting with demons.
*A small, stout imp winces under the countless cursed threads that bind her.*
*Smile widely. Surely you don&apos;t look like a killer!*
Speed Lowered
But I hate &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; so, so much more. He loved me when I was useful. He cast me out when &lt;i&gt;you failed to die.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the cub you hope so. You very much hope so.*
Earth
*Say you haven&apos;t found him yet.*
Mother and Master, there was precious little difference between the two.
Time and again have I traded power for my soul. Time and again and still once more. But still, we&apos;ll have a trade.
None of your BUSINESS, you leathery freak!
Deal [1] and Cripple target character.
*The vision fades, and reality draws closer. Just as your hold on Ryker&apos;s spirit fades, a final vision crashes into view.*
You are up to no good!
Shabby Boots
So, you&apos;ve come all this way, only to let another seize the prize. How do you feel? Jealous perhaps? Even just &lt;i&gt;a little?&lt;/i&gt; Come now, you can tell me...
I like a dwarf who knows what he wants and isn&apos;t afraid to take it. You&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. But let&apos;s take it slow. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
Roost Anlon. I own this place. I&apos;d ask you to introduce yourself, but I already know who you are, &lt;i&gt;Sebille&lt;/i&gt;. Or do you prefer being called &apos;Godwoken&apos;?
*Your body convulses with Amadia&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile widens at the sight of your agony.*
*Roost gives you a long, hard look. There is no trace of camaraderie in his stare as he strides towards you, one slow and heavy step at a time.*
The &lt;i&gt;gods&lt;/i&gt; didn&apos;t make you into a mercenary. But nor did the gods make you refuse to kill that elf in Fort Joy. Oh yes, I know about that. You&apos;re a paradox, Ifan. And who&apos;s responsible?
Wait!
*Tell her you were taking a walk and just wandered in here...*
*Wonder who he is to have known so much about Braccus.*
Browse as you must, but do respect my wares. Proper handling requires nimble fingers.
*The spirit turns his rage upon you, and as you tear his Source away his rage turns into hate - a hate for you and for all the world. And then... the hate is gone.*
Purple Necklace
Because, my friend... when I offered myself to her, she never answered. I was Godwoken, and I failed her. But she too failed me.
Well. It doesn&apos;t matter now, I guess. What&apos;s done is done. And I&apos;m glad you were there to help me see it through.
*The ghost shakes its head in confusion.*
It&apos;s a dull choice, but I suppose you want what you want. Stew is a special order from the kitchen, on account of you being an elf.
*Tell her that if she knew the person underneath, she wouldn&apos;t even offer you any sympathy.*
*Tell her Gareth is safe. Or as safe as one can be in a place like this.*
Yes, my champion! Feast.
*...Before you stands the Goddess Amadia.*
Invite to Party
*The spirit of the owl flaps and flutters in distress, beady eyes burning through you all the while. The tenacious little spirit holds on as long as he can, but eventually, his Source flows into you and &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; is no more.*
Mountain Top
Why... yes... Of course I am. All my life. *Hiss*.
These skills of yours - they let you control minds? Force brothers to draw steel against each other?
*Muse that the dog is right. The master may admire the cat, but admiration is not love.*
[BEAST] *Tell the dwarf that&apos;s preposterous. Ifan is your hat rack!*
*Humbly bow your head. You will do your best.*
[BEAST] *Tell her you&apos;re known as the Beast.*
Please! It&apos;s my &lt;i&gt;ma &lt;/i&gt;over there.
The Mistake
Give up. Aren&apos;t you tired of fighting?
Reckon you&apos;ve got a job to do, ain&apos;t ya, elf.
Fine. Have it your way. But I&apos;m watching you, so you better keep yourself out of trouble.
*The man is frozen on the spot.*
As a Godwoken on the path to Divinity, I should seek teachers to help me develop my Source powers.
[SEBILLE] *Reach out. Allow your power to burgeon and grow... then direct it all at the sick heart. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are the Prime Scion. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are the future of elves. Consign the Mother to the sinews of the past.*
Can only be used once per combat
and the crypt of the great Lucian.
I can grin and bear it all, but what I cannot bear; what I cannot stand is &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
So? What&apos;s the word?
Driftwood became a centre of industry, trade and transport.
Did he wish he&apos;d given his soul to the Veil, or was he sure he&apos;d done the right thing?
What ugly magic is... no... no... &lt;i&gt;NO!&lt;/i&gt;
Portrait of a Woman
Couch
*The cat looks at you intently, tail swishing to and fro in a question mark.*
Grrrrrrrrrr...
O&apos;er globes they glide, o&apos;er flats and sharps. Whither go they, lady of life? Direct them!
Help me, please! I can&apos;t die, I can only burn!
*Tell her you saved Gwydian Rince, and you&apos;ll save her too.*
To grow your Source, to achieve your potential, you must embrace the Void.
Gareth had a change of heart. He&apos;ll let Jonathan live.
Dear gods, no. Pray kill me before I reach such a nadir.
That why you&apos;d see us all swallowed up by Voidwoken? Sour grapes cause your lot aren&apos;t in charge anymore? Pathetic.
And the lever that then opens the entrance - it requires a great power source. I have one for my own use of course, but you will have to find something for yourself.
*Without a further word, the Red Prince releases his grip and you fall to the ground with a rather hard thud. Overhead, you hear him close the shutters with a bang.*
[LOHSE] *Resist the feeling. Tell Gareth you are no Godwoken. You have a different calling.*
Yes, milord!
Dark Lord
*The dwarf rolls his eyes and shakes his head with a sigh.*
We need to move. Don&apos;t mistake me, Godwoken: The Order is coming, and they&apos;re coming for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
If it&apos;s a bit of wickedness you&apos;re after I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t disappoint. Consider yourself invited.
*Slane smiles at you and turns to leave. He takes no more than a few steps before he shimmers out of lizard form, blurring in mid-air back into a majestic dragon that soars away.*
Don&apos; let &apos;em silence yer song, whether fanfare or lullaby.
The Chronicler
Then consider me against you, old friend.
*She stood up to Braccus Rex! Ask why she&apos;s crying over a little teasing.*
*A vision of her anger floats before you - the tigers of the forest lying lifeless in the fog - &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; fog, ben-Mezd - and she the last remaining spirit. But she has made a deal - she has sold herself to the God King...*
[BEAST] *Motion all around you. Being Beast o&apos; the Sea is a tough job, and you could use a good second-in-command.*
Glad it didn&apos;t freak you out too much, though. I know this kind of stuff can be... weird. If you aren&apos;t used to it.
*Say nothing, but reach inside yourself and summon just a hint of Source to your eyes, where it flickers like green flame.*
I&apos;m still here. As you probably noticed.
I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s one of those Shriekers.
Czech
[LOHSE] *Ask the cub if it wants some good advice.*
*The dwarf cocks his head left, then right. His eyes squint and his brows rise as if lifted by an unseen fish-hook.*
Even if we are here under unhappy circumstances, still I feel it.
*Lean forward to listen to the secret.*
*Ask if it really matters, so far from home.*
The White Magisters are looking for evidence of the local dwarves&apos; smuggling operation.
Alright, alright, you&apos;ve made your point.
Have you been to the temple of Zorl-Stissa? Is the kins-knight safe? &lt;i&gt;Is Zorl-Stissa&apos;s chosen champion safe?&lt;/i&gt;
*Stroke her hair. There she is.*
They were gathered round it... took the brunt of it. Got me on the arm, though. Clipped me. It was enough...
It&apos;s true, you know. What the Magisters said. My brother&apos;s boy Gwydian... he&apos;s got Source in him. Now that his folks are gone, we&apos;ve all he&apos;s got. We thought we could keep him safe.
[SEBILLE] *Say &lt;i&gt;&apos;Ah. So it&apos;s personal?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Offer your condolences.*
Search for Doctor Daeva.
Spirit of Nurse Do
All May Not Be As It Seems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*The ability to change from one form to another has been the stuff of myth and legend for as long as people have told stories. While he does not rush to judgement, for Cranley Huwbert the idea seems potentially heretical. He does, however, seem deeply fixated on the possibility that a man (and it may be noted that Huwbert is indeed a man) may spend time as a chicken.*
*Inform him that Murga has agreed to fight.*
*Then the regular thump... thump... thump... stops. A smile twitches upon her lips. Suddenly her heart goes BOOM! - like the erupting of a volcano. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!*

*Avert your eyes and consume her Source. This sinner&apos;s feelings do not concern you.*
*Tell him no, the waiter goes to serve the dog.*
He was the finest painter of his generation, and he used his own blood for his masterwork - the final panel of &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian.&lt;/i&gt;
*Nod. It&apos;s a deal.*
I left the Nameless Isle without carrying out the Sallow Man&apos;s orders.
Cave - Hideout
Tattered Note
*Smile sweetly. None taken.*
*Ask her what a guy has to do to earn that stare.*
Plenty o&apos; in-fighting, even among the savages, ain&apos;t there. I&apos;d think you lot&apos;d band together to wreak your horrors on the rest of us, but you just ain&apos;t civilised enough, I reckon.
I am ready - ready for &lt;i&gt;you!&lt;/i&gt;
Farewell Godwoken. The Hall of Echoes beckons me.
Weapon Range
*Do as the voice says and look down.*
...but they slip away in the night, taking supplies. Cowards and traitors, all of them. I&apos;m looking for &lt;i&gt;loyal &lt;/i&gt;Magisters, vanishing in broad daylight... desertion just &lt;i&gt;doesn&apos;t fit.&lt;/i&gt;
...and you. If I find this is some sort of trick, there&apos;ll be consequences. Now go.
Thankfully, you are ready for them. Even without my guidance you have relearned almost everything you had forgotten. I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but I have one last thing to teach you...
And in each place I&apos;ve come to find...
*Say that she needn&apos;t despair - Braccus is long gone, a dusty figure from history books.*
