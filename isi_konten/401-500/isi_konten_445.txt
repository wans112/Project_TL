The job was supposed to be simple: Break into the vault, take the gold. The Rogue hadn&apos;t bothered to ask whose vault and whose gold it was - such questions were irrelevant.  Cold, thick steel and shining, precious gold had no human element, after all. One could be coaxed into yielding, and the other could be delivered to whomever had ordered the job in exchange for a small fee or, on particularly ill-fated occasions, the Rogue&apos;s life.  This job was, unfortunately, the latter.  The vault&apos;s internal mechanisms clicked small high- and low-pitched sounds, satisfying to the practiced ear. A few more manipulations, and- success! The rogue pulled open the great, heavy door just enough to slip inside. Noiselessly filling a satchel with gold, the thief had no time to react to the heavy hands that seized both busy shoulders.  &quot;Well done,&quot; it said, turning the Rogue to face the voice&apos;s owner. &quot;But anyone so adept with a lockpick should be working for the realm, not against it.  &quot; &quot;You did manage to catch me,&quot; the Rogue replied. &quot;I&apos;m the Grand Master of the Source Hunters,&quot; he laughed. &quot;I can catch anyone.&quot;
She told us it was old. Told us it was dangerous. Told us it was important...
Griff&apos;s oranges were stuffed with drudanae! No wonder he wanted them back.
Braccus Rex has charged him, tried him, convicted and punished him. I know not the crime, but he has been sentenced to remain in this vault for all time, and to prevent others from entering.
*Nod. It&apos;s how elves share memories.*
*As you approach the figure, your guise suddenly feels hot against your skin - unbearably hot.*
I see. You would have me see you as a friend, yet you are not. You disappoint me. You may leave.

The truth hurts, but they&apos;ll get over it.
*Say that men in power will always use those beneath them. And the Divine was a very powerful man.*
*The boy whistles a somber tune as he gazes around the makeshift camp.*
The Godwoken renounced Divinity and returned the Source to the world. Will harmony reign over Rivellon? Time, as always, will tell.
This must be Garvan&apos;s mentor. Buried in a shallow grave - poor fellow.
We gave a potion to Geraldine the cow and asked nothing in return.
[SCHOLAR] *Marvel at the creature&apos;s language ability, and ask how it can speak in this manner.*
You are Godwoken. Think of what you can do for the kingdom as Divine. Far more than I can as queen. Go. I will serve the people as they ask. You will serve them as they warrant.
Well. Ain&apos;t no shame in being whoever you are. You&apos;ll be alright soon&apos;s all this blows over. And so will we.
*Tell him the pursuit of divinity means more than anything.*
You&apos;re so cool! Why are you all red like that? Can I touch your scales?
Well.
Because I don&apos;t intend to end up with my lips stitched together, that&apos;s why!
Paladin Marksman
No.

*Tell the elf that you&apos;re Godwoken, here to claim your birthright.*
Ha! Your science won&apos;t help you here. In the Arena, you must be willing to suffer if you want to achieve greatness.
I&apos;ll do what I do best: hold things together. Those that remain still need a chief, at least while their favourite Beast is away. I have no more surprises up my sleeve; I dare say you&apos;ve had enough.
*Bruno barks, beside himself with joy.*
You understand her, do you? You understand that she murders a man because he did like he was bid to by a Master; by a higher force than he?
But until I hear otherwise, my orders are to find Higba. And heaven help him if I find him before my orders change.
Is that indigestion, or is it... oh god, not now.
Paladin Lieutenant
Take me away from here. Please, she can&apos;t keep us here!
*Say you&apos;re pretty rusty; maybe it just doesn&apos;t like &lt;i&gt;bad &lt;/i&gt;music.*
Halt, scaleskin! What word do you bring?
... forgive. The armour warns of thieves. I do not expect friends.

You don&apos;t know that. Her name was Helene and she served the bailiff from the House of Law. She was really tall and really smart. I bet you &lt;i&gt;did &lt;/i&gt;know her.

Yes, we&apos;re well aware. But if the dwarves want to lose their minds in some haze, let them. At least it keeps the little rats from fighting.
GET AWAY FROM THAT!
You&apos;ve met it before, in one form or another. The Void doesn&apos;t exactly keep a low profile.

You surrender to &lt;i&gt;no-one.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am your God. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am your King. Betray me, and I shall shatter your soul. Deny me, and you shall freeze eternal in the bitter Void!
I see... or at least, eh, I &lt;i&gt;think &lt;/i&gt;I do...

You are Silenced.
They summoned the Great Acorn once, they will be able to summon it again. We have to destroy their order once and for all.
Upstairs at the Black Bull tavern, we found a weather-beaten man mumbling in his sleep.
*You recognise the elf he threatens as Saheila from Fort Joy. Stride forward and tell him to release her - &lt;i&gt;now.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Chuckle. Tell him you&apos;re going to destroy the God King and all his people. You&apos;ll be using an extremely powerful secret weapon. The Source King does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to be on the wrong end of that weapon.*
Where&apos;s Almira? I won&apos;t go another step without her.
*The world around you smears into watercolours, then grows darker, lighter, lesser. Malady&apos;s hands dissolve around yours.*
*She glimmers in and out of view, merging with the shadows. Crowing, she slams her hand down hard beside your face, hard enough to make you flinch.*
You&apos;ll have to forgive my limited stock. The incident in the harbour was... well. I was lucky to escape with my life, much less anything to sell.
[UNDEAD] *Frown. The pleasures of the flesh don&apos;t have much appeal for you...*
Bring the amulet and the scroll to the Path of Blood. By the statue of Lucian there is a hidden mechanism. Set the fully charged amulet in the hidden receptacle, then read from the scroll.

You are simple beasts. And you simply do not like my - well, not &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;kind, but those that look like me.

*She seems to look right through you, that smile playing about her lips - terrifying in its beauty.*
*Thank the cat, and scritch his skeletal neck.*
Erma?! Where are you, darling?
*Ask why she would do such a thing.*
*Big Marge&apos;s spirit pecks and pecks at you. It causes no physical pain, but you can feel her beak pecking at your very soul. Peck, peck, &lt;i&gt;peck.*&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Aventurim 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At last, I think I have discovered a method of keeping my home and gardens in good repair. The &apos;inhabitants&apos; of the Stonegarden are just lying there anyway... why not put them to work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aventurim 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;They raise from the dead easily enough, but my word are they ever a fright to look upon! I have fashioned some garb for them that will keep their true faces hidden. And hopefully hold in some of the smell also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aventurim 13&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must confess to growing fond of my silent companions. They never argue back, they hop to work at the slightest order, and best of all? They keep the riff-raff out.

It is not my place to question Braccus Rex&apos;s will. I am to execute those who defy his legacy.
&lt;i&gt;HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
Up to no good, are we? Word travels fast, you know.
Braccus Rex, the Source King raised from the dead, vanished entirely. Some say he still walks the world, others that he went back underground. One thing is true - no-one has met him and returned to tell the tale.
Is something wrong?
Anyway, back to business as usual around here now. My door&apos;s always open if you need healing or supplies.

Maybe if you dedicated yourself fully to him, the God King would give you the same honour. Maybe...
Nevermore. Nevermore. Not since we displeased mad Braccus Rex. The truth we spoke. His fortune told. No divinity would he be.
