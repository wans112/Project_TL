Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 34: Dune Mantises
I&apos;ve fought under the Divine banner for many years. But now to have turned our swords on each other...
Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; know who you are, Godwoken? Do &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;know what you want? Do you know your heart&apos;s desire? &lt;i&gt;Set me free...&lt;/i&gt;
Muddy Mittens

Magister Murtof
*It is Zorl-Stissa who has withdrawn from you, in her own godly guise once more.*

Defeat! Your king is dead!
*Dizziness. It lasts just a moment - but long enough for you to feel Tir-Cendelius&apos; presence. You hear no words, yet understand: it&apos;s imperative you accept Ryker&apos;s bargain.*
What was that? Speak up, girl!
Flashing Footsteps
*Tell her you&apos;ve had enough, and walk away.*
Please, why would I kill Lucian&apos;s second most charming son?
The Voidling is following us.
*Let it go free. You look forward to this reward.*
Bridge Blocker
That so? Oh hey, you&apos;re right; reckon the elf I&apos;m thinkin&apos; of was got rid of last week. Probably for the best; Griff cut her real good.
*The unusual bloom continues unabated, as if parroting someone&apos;s words rather than speaking of its own accord.*
Well I think you&apos;re a big slithery leather-lady and I wouldn&apos;t play with you if you were the last talking crocodile who ever lived!
Do you think me as soft-brained as one of your dwarf children? I know what you are. I smell it on your breath. You &lt;i&gt;reek &lt;/i&gt;of Source.
Ignore any feelings of dizziness, itchy bones, or a dire sense of existential dread. They are all perfectly normal, although you will need to sacrifice a little Source along the way.
*Isbeil returns to her review of your adventures.*
The Gods must have sensed my unwillingness. Still, I wanted to serve them - I became a Knight of Rhalic that day.
Kissed Ring
*She turns back to the forest, her bow held ready.*
How&apos;s about a trade? Our deaths for your life? You walk out of here, and leave us your word that you&apos;ll destroy our Soul Jars?

Ha. Look at us. A merry band of freaks are we.

Berserker AI
If he should reject philosophy and the natural arts for the sake of power? Well I cannot imagine a worse torture.
Shadow to shadow...
Dwarven Staff
&lt;i&gt;Armour that would duplicate, dominate. They would raise an army and bend it to their will.&lt;/i&gt;
*More squirrel knights? Say you shudder to think of others quite like &lt;i&gt;him.&lt;/i&gt;*
I&apos;ve come to collect, Sebille. I presume you intend to honour our agreement?
You may not.
I see that savagery does not win.

Talents
*Rest your hand on the statue&apos;s wing.*

Watch. Do not touch.
To arms! I&apos;m not dying in this canyon.

How brave you have been. How much you have achieved!
*Make your presence known.*
*Search his soul for anger.*
I don&apos;t even know what I&apos;m looking for at this stage, but right now our great Lord Kemm is fit to explode so I&apos;m following orders as best I can.
Remember the Covenant. Do as I command, and release the Deathfog. Renege on your vows, and I will show you the true meaning of suffering. Now go.
*The conjurer&apos;s gaze remains fixes on her portal. She gently flicks her wrist; the portal widens, and devours the sea at an even greater rate.*

Caramel
*A cart contains many barrels more, recovered from a wrecked ship. The room is filled with voices, cracking jokes and swearing oaths as you go about unloading the cart.*
Pawn. You have an ugly way with words.
Glad to hear it. You&apos;d just be buying yourself trouble in this town. What Julian doesn&apos;t know can&apos;t hurt him.
Shouldn&apos;t you be drunk in a mine somewhere? Walk on, short stuff, I don&apos;t have time to talk.
Look at all these poor saps. They should&apos;ve just let us &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt;.

*He tips his temple in salute. For a moment a black smoke-snake coils around his fist... and then is gone.*
What - no, get away! No, no - please - I&apos;m only &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;free.
And he eats cats.
Thought you died in the Deathfog! Thought you died a hero, but I s&apos;pose it&apos;s better to &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; as one...
It should have been me.
The rabble panicked â€” the carnage began.
*Say you&apos;re always keen on interesting contracts.*

Find another Sourcerer teacher.
*Snap that it&apos;s none of her business.*
*She whispers there really is no need for your assistance, but from the weight of her arms around you, you can tell she&apos;d have trouble getting back up by herself.*
I... hope you won&apos;t mind if our paths cross again in future. I&apos;ve been waiting an age to find answers as helpful as these.
*Say you&apos;d like your nearby party members to join you. They are at your command.*
What have you eaten now?! My soul?! My very SOUL?!
How can I help you?
Ah, my poor mentor - lost to the wilds, I regret to inform you. Take it from me: Avoid the open country around here. The Voidwoken are &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;to be trifiled with.
*Groans.*
*Ask the rat if it saw what happened here.*

*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Shrug. You&apos;ll just have to see what happens.*
Find out who killed Gareth&apos;s parents.
*The chronicler shudders, looking sick to his stomach.*
This is my call to make.
Is it? I&apos;m not even sure what that would be. In all the years that mattered, I had only my devotion.
*Tell him he doesn&apos;t have to do this. You can pay him more than whatever his contract&apos;s worth.*
The Barricade
You ask me and I say she&apos;s mad as mink with its tail on fire. Begging your pardon, of course!

Hey, Godwoken!
Heed me. &lt;i&gt;Leave the cargo of the Peacemaker alone.&lt;/i&gt;
