Okay. I admit that one still creeps me out sometimes. ..
Wait a second! You&apos;re the red devil Kalias told me about! Ieieieieieieieieie!!!
A sight for sore eyes!
It wafts on the wind. The Black Ring choked. Arx will choke. They will all choke...
Blind Priestess of the Ring
*Inform him that the young woman in his cellar is dead.*
Quick! There&apos;s not a moment to spare. She has him, and there&apos;s no telling what she&apos;ll do!
I&apos;m prepared to offer a generous reward, my dear. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;dying&lt;/i&gt; to show off those smouldering talents of yours. You just don&apos;t know how to handle them.

*Beg her pardon and say you&apos;re just doing your best to stay out of trouble.*
He used to love me, used to worship at my spinnerets. But now he doesn&apos;t talk to his queen anymore... he just milks my venom.
*The spirit of Fulton looks around, distraught and confused. He doesn&apos;t notice you.*
To rise to Divinity, you probably need to take a gulp. Though I&apos;m sure it won&apos;t be that simple.
Why, that&apos;s Peeper! Let me get a good look - yes, I couldn&apos;t mistake it. That&apos;s Marge&apos;s favourite egg! She&apos;ll be wanting him back right away!
*Note how free you feel, now that Adramahlihk is defeated.*
*Ask who &apos;He&apos; might be.*
Thick of the Fight
Fish. This is a fish factory. I&apos;m shipping fish to Arx. Now please, there&apos;s the door, I suggest you use it.
Captain&apos;s Journal
*Swuffle*
*Remark on his defeat. Between him and Isbeil, the God King&apos;s chosen aren&apos;t so mighty.*
I &lt;i&gt;told&lt;/i&gt; you, I&apos;m on duty here!
Bypass the blood, and Lucian brings the rumble. Skyquakes across the heavens, what Lucian said! Punishment for the easy-walk.
*Say you&apos;re just a fellow inmate and have some questions.*
*She glowers at you, a vicious gleam emanating from the empty sockets where her eyes used to be.*
I know. I know it looks delicious, Quercus, but try to restrain yourself.
The murderous Sourcerer Windego, who sank the boat that brought us here, tried to kill us once more.
The Lich
Say that, but... you know. &lt;i&gt;Mean &lt;/i&gt;it.
*There is no reaction from either the inscription nor the skull. If only it had been that easy.*
*Hand over the gold.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*The Doctor approaches you. He offers you freedom from your deepest fear - that there is something deeply wrong with your son. In exchange, he&apos;ll look after your spirit. You take the deal and give him your soul.*
Yet you awakened me from nightmare with a single utterance: my name. And I&apos;m grateful for that. How amazing - that a name can wield so much power.
Burial Rites
*Inspect the vines.*
Treatise on Humanity
*This Seeker is beyond saving, all blood and broken bones.*
I don&apos;t see any Source on you or me. I guess they&apos;re wrong. Or crazy!
First, the student; next, the teacher. Get &apos;em both, and we&apos;ll by flyin&apos; high.
*Isbeil? Demand he explain himself.*
*Squeak squeak squeeee*
[BARBARIAN] *Step forward and offer to break his neck if he detains you a moment longer.*
Hello! I like your collar. Do you like mine? I like it because it&apos;s shiny. And it makes me feel better, like less... less... CRAZY! You know?
Lord Arhu may know how to access Lucian&apos;s tomb.
The main measure of a character&apos;s power.
Everything?
[JESTER] *Ooh - any kind of magic? How about... Necrogeopyrorogue-o-mancy?*
You dare speak of &lt;i&gt;the best&lt;/i&gt; when you refused us? You dare speak of &lt;i&gt;consideration&lt;/i&gt; when you were happy to see us part forever?
*Though you wait some time, it would seem that Amadia has no blessings to impart to you.*
And you. I&apos;ll see you soon. &lt;i&gt;Very &lt;/i&gt;soon.
I envy you, then. I feel only ice, as if my soul has been ripped open to allow the chill of nothingness to invade it.
*Offer her a healing potion.*

Large Mallet
Not equipable
Adramahlihk. He must be furious. We need to get out of here - now.
That is all. Their suns have set to serve a greater dawn. The world awaits your true awakening.
I suppose I should start with an apology for the attempts on your life. Talk about getting off on the wrong foot, wouldn&apos;t you say?
*Tell her to unlock the gate - you want to look inside.*
*Remark on her party. So intriguing! What can she tell you about it?*
*You contemplate his words and come to a conclusion: he may be right...*
Zapor&apos;s Chief Mate
Squeeeeeeeeak!
*Say you aren&apos;t sure; this sounds dangerous.*
Get help.
A cleansing fire has its purpose. But Braccus&apos; actions were simple barbarism.
Entertaining enough.
Left over from the days of Braccus, I assume.
*Agree to kill Jonathan and return with evidence.*
Ain&apos;t so big on Barstan&apos;s latest poem.
The old beast was put down? HA! Death was too much of a kindness.

*Tell him you&apos;re looking for something with a little more... spice... to help pass the time.*
Lying Sourcerer filth! Get away from me!
*The spirit scowls.*
Every one of your races resembles them in some manner. And the statues you have built to your Gods look remarkably familiar.
*Explain that you&apos;ve already found a wand like that, but it&apos;s out of charges.*
*From shadow comes sunshine. You&apos;re home. You&apos;re in your own palace, atop the great library tower. You behold the Forbidden City, only it&apos;s infinitely bigger than you remember: a sea of white marble that reaches as far as the eye can see.*
*Fane looks up, a playful sparkle in his demeanour.*
I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; sleep tonight, as balmy as a babe.
*Say you haven&apos;t given it much thought. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, after all, will be the one to ascend.*

She&apos;ll be fine. Now move along.
Skeletal Stormbinder
*Refuse to fight.*
You will pay! Help, thief!
I must secure my pockets. A thief dares pick them.
Tell us once more of how far your fame has spread, Rask? Tell us of how they whisper your name in dread.

You are t-t-truly heartless. Curse you, Braccus Rex. R-release me! I atone for my sins!
You flatter me, Sebille, but if all I had to do was give, you would long ago since have received.
It&apos;s called a &apos;Source collar&apos;!
You can have this. I found it outside but I can&apos;t read it yet. That&apos;s next year, and then I&apos;ll learn it.
Unequip
Restore up to [1], depending on relevant surface area.[2][3]
Imagine... A black room. It&apos;s been your room for years. You know it by touch more than by sight, for it&apos;s always dark.
It&apos;s not like Lord Arhu to vanish at a time like this.
Take that, Voidwoken!
*The heat seeps into every crevasse between your bones. You haven&apos;t breathed in what seems like hours. You desperately want to scream. But Syrus Oates did not scream.*
You saved me! You gave me &lt;i&gt;my name&lt;/i&gt; back!
[UNDEAD] *Demand to know how he knew you were undead.*
Rivellon can no longer bear your burdens. You made a grave mistake - and now you pay for it.
Fine then, it&apos;s like that. Well, bub, I asked you to find Mordus. I still don&apos;t see him. So as far as I&apos;m concerned, the deal&apos;s not on just yet.
*Ask them what&apos;s in it for you.*
*Remembering the horrors of Fort Joy, draw your weapon.*

Higba the Tinkerer
*Retort that you didn&apos;t come here to answer riddles.*
You may go.
Lucian&apos;s tomb is not his final resting place. But I will see you there. Then we&apos;ll see where Lucian really lies. Then we&apos;ll tell the truth! Then we&apos;ll set him free! Until then... bye-bye.
I do. I prepare it myself. One only has to follow the path...
The future is dim. It should not have been this way.
Funny. On t-the run from Fort Joy, are you?
The Gods robbed me of my Godwoken birthright, the least I can do is rob them of their hope.
Paddy fell in the ravine, though. P-o-o-o-o-o-o-r Paddy.
Spirit of an Imp
There&apos;s a place not far from here that&apos;s safe enough for our kind. It&apos;s out in the swamps. Ain&apos;t a home, but you can breathe for a minute and figure out what to do next. Let&apos;s go already.
Never saw you before, shorty. Welcome to Arx. Care to see a trick?
I&apos;ve been held in that helmet for centuries. Just one trick of many Braccus Rex has performed on this execrable island.
*Reach out with compassion; take the shortest straw from Kinnet&apos;s shaking hands.*
We make arrangements. We travel soon. I must meet... someone who can help us. I say no more than this.

*Forego words, and let your weapon do the talking. Attack!*
[1] increases all Water damage you deal, and any Vitality healing or Magic Armour restoration that you cause.
*Tell her you don&apos;t want to do anything but wait and watch.*
Hmmm? What? You be needin&apos; something from me, lass? Ain&apos;t much inclined to rub elbows with humans if you catch my drift.
PEEP! PEEP! PEEP!
*The puppet looks at you with what almost amounts to &lt;i&gt;curiosity&lt;/i&gt;. You detect Source coursing through its inner mechanisms, lending it the appearance of sentiency.*
and the advancement of all the races.
The Shriekers... they&apos;re horrifying. W-we can&apos;t move forward while they&apos;re keeping watch. They&apos;ll blast us through.
Aww. I was really rootin&apos; for you! You&apos;d have been a really good Divine, I bet!
Justice? These days? Seems unlikely.
[SCHOLAR] *You&apos;ve read about ancient lamps being used to trap spirits. You wonder... tentatively rub the lamp.*
*Ask the creature who holds the key to its chains.*
