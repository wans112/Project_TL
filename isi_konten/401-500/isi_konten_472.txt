Not if it&apos;s enclasped by sheer will - like mine.
The same way I do everything, of course: demonic guile.
*He sniffs and looks askance at you.*
Wage War
*The stone form exudes warmth and grace, welcoming you into its presence.*
Meistr tells me it cannot happen. That I am not Godwoken. But in my heart - I know I am special. I try. I burn the root. I breath the smoke, and it burns me back.
It&apos;s fixed to the platform. I wonder why.
Don&apos;t you come near me! This catch is bad enough - I don&apos;t need you spoilin&apos; it even more.
The most inhospitable plane imaginable. A realm of insanity and death beneath a starless black.
I get you. There&apos;s just something missing, isn&apos;t there. Whatever there is, it isn&apos;t enough.
*Gareth greets you in thoughtful silence.*
*The dog scurries away to sniff about the area, leaving you with his approval and an itchy face.*
Call me Ryker. And I shall call you Ifan, yes? Such fortune, that a fellow Lone Wolf would cross my path purely by... chance.
&lt;i&gt;*Shall you be Divine?*&lt;/i&gt;
You better watch yourself. I don&apos;t have patience for thieves!
*Go quietly.*
I don&apos;t know how I could have been so wrong about you. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;never &lt;/i&gt;wrong.
Truth be told, I&apos;d prefer to slip off silently, but you have something of mine.
*Sebille slides her hand in yours, makes your heart skip a beat with her particularly coquettish smile.*
And now that the war&apos;s over, there&apos;s plenty of cleaning up to do.
All&apos;s fair in war, they say.
Always remember: Rhalic is watching. &lt;i&gt;Everything&lt;/i&gt;.
Demons? Let them tremble.
She used to be a smart cookie, but she&apos;s gotten careless since that new advisor&apos;s been twisting her ear.
Antiquated
Can&apos;t you take a hint? Scram, already.
Find Brahmos the Wanderer.
[NOBLE] *Insist this line of questioning is below your station. You shall enter forthwith.*
*The spirit offers a thin smile.*
*The Source from the jar flows out, you can feel its invisible presence all around you. You reach out to touch it when the collar around your neck locks tight, burning your skin.*
This adventurer had hidden... assets.
I was just a boy. My brother was gifted. That&apos;s what our parents said.
Ha! *Hack!* Ha! We&apos;ll see how long that lasts.
I blame you not. Yet, nor do I absolve you of your broken promise. For a moment I beheld hope, bright as a summer morn. And now the clouds descend once more...
Mayhem came to Arx on Lucian&apos;s Day. As the Voidwoken attacks worsened, the Paladins of the Divine Order turned on their Magister comrades.
I&apos;ll do my best. But it&apos;s hard to teach an old wolf, well, &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;tricks.
*He coughs up a gout of blood.*
&lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is why I have chosen you. This is why I would not see you crushed by a kraken and swallowed by a tainted sea. Only you and others like you can wield this great power.
*Press for more information. What is this &apos;it&apos; you supposedly want?*
Well. I wouldn&apos;t refuse your help. If Griff can&apos;t be here, maybe you&apos;re the next best thing.
Broadsword
Throw [1] explosive traps at target locations. Each trap takes a turn to activate. When active, trap will explode when a character approaches it.
*Tell him the place was littered with dead Magisters, Sourcerers and dwarves.*
You take that back! You take it... well, it&apos;s not &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; job. The Hammer will change your attitude soon enough, you&apos;ll see.
You are not Braccus Rex.
Demonic Nightmare
That&apos;s what happens when you give any few people too much power. Goes straight to their heads, and it&apos;s the common folk that pay the price.

*Beast replies with a nod. There&apos;s no denying the glint in his eye. Whatever the future holds, he is game for it.*
[VILLAIN] *Snarl at him; of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; you are the master.*
*Wings flutter. A war owl swoops. It plucks the letter from your hand, and flies away.*
We armed ourselves with some basic weapons.
*Birdie bows his head. You raise your weapon.*
Poor little baby. What happened to yeh? Don&apos;t you worry - I&apos;ll fix yeh right up.
Jimmy
No! Stop, thief! NONONONONONONONO - !
Tale as old as time. He secured his place and didn&apos;t want any upstarts to come after it.
*Whisper in her ear; Mudbarrow wants his money.*
*Tell him he&apos;s free to go.*
How very pleasurable, is it not, to finally meet in the flesh? For it is very much in the flesh that we must meet after all. Become one.
Armour-Piercing Grenade
Oh, is that supposed to scare me? You all have those ridiculous names. The Wayward Owl! The Fidgety Lavender! The Overturned Bucket!
Bypass the Path of Blood.
Get your hands away from me. I&apos;m fine. Certainly healthy enough to deal with these turncoats.
You do not get away with this!
I&apos;d rather not meet a similar end - it would be best to keep moving.
*You spy some blood on Jimmy&apos;s beak, and some distension of his fluffy belly. You can&apos;t tell what killed him, but you&apos;re sure as sure can be that he&apos;s dead.*
Tarquin&apos;s notes on the use and operation of teleporter pyramids.
Let&apos;s head to the fort. We&apos;ll be safer there... I hope.
Press [IE_DestructionToggle] and move your cursor to the door. Then, attack with [IE_Interact].
I don&apos;t know where you picked up our words, Sourcerer, but they won&apos;t save you.
*Ask why he&apos;s mulling around the outskirts rather than entering the graveyard himself.*
[LOHSE] *Tell the rat you&apos;re sure the use of magic would kill it.*
Has he not simply &lt;i&gt;told &lt;/i&gt;you by now? Haha. Are you &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;you&apos;re Godwoken? That head of yours is awfully empty for a wannabe Divine. Shouldn&apos;t you be wise, or something?
It isn&apos;t every day you get taken to gods-know-where by a statue. Embrace it!
Iron Door
...where did you hear that, precisely? Never mind... the Aeteran is a children&apos;s fable, nothing more. Supposedly a wand with an infinite capacity for Source. Pure nonsense, I assure you.
*Say you&apos;ll have a look around. You&apos;re eager to get far away from Fort Joy.*
Here&apos;s the key - wait, where is it?
Mage Shoes
*The chest before you is covered in old Ancient Empire pictograms. You consider trying to find some lock picks in your bag, but looking at the chest you don&apos;t see any keyhole...*
His head on this here table.
Black Dragon
That smarts every time, you know...
Scounnnnndrel! Dastaaaaaaaard! Cowaaaaaaaard! &lt;i&gt;Sheeeeeeeeeep!&lt;/i&gt;
*Reach into his mind.*
No more Source, no more powers... *smiles* don&apos;t worry darling, I know you have plenty of other qualities...
On the other hand... I really could do with a dogsbody, even if it&apos;s the sort that leaves others to rot on a sinking ship...
Ya never bothered to find the melody in ya? A shame - ya just gotta look! Me brother Laslor couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket when he were a wee thing. Now, he&apos;s got the voice of an angel.

[IFAN] *Tell him you&apos;re nowhere &lt;i&gt;near&lt;/i&gt; as tired as he is: knight of a half-dead god.*
Blue-Green Ring
Adept Fighter
He promised me a path unburdened by Lucian&apos;s &lt;i&gt;pathetic&lt;/i&gt; need to defend the defenceless. He promised me a world dominated by only the worthiest bloodlines across the ages.
*Ifan nocks the crossbow with an arrow. He hoists it up to his shoulder, a satisfied smile brightening his face as he stares down the shadow-swirled stock. Raising an eyebrow, he holds it out for you to try.*
A face that seems rather stubbornly attached to his skull.
And... fury. Oh, Divine, it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;planning&lt;/i&gt; -
[OUTLAW] *Promise that you do your best work in the dark.*
Still a lucky man, I am.
Before &lt;i&gt;it all&lt;/i&gt;, Voidwoken stole the Sourcerers along the cliffs, headed for Seven knows where.
*She turns and looks you in the eye, in horror and in pain. Oblivion glimmers in her eye as she stares into the abyss.*
Indeed. You see, I&apos;ve found the demon&apos;s home plane. Many of our kind have them - a quiet place off the beaten path of most universes, where one can... be alone. Typically with all the *ahem* souls one has ensnared.
*Turn to another topic.*
Poison Flask
I must&apos;ve taken too much of the stuff though - &apos;wound up fully-dead instead of half-dead. Those bastards haven&apos;t even moved my body!
Magister traitors. Black Ring. Voidwoken. Now Arhu&apos;s missing. Hell of a day.
We pay more for less and it&apos;s the likes of you that&apos;s to blame, lizard.
*She&apos;s relieved.*
Sebille! Good to see you again.
This ship has the claim of a cap&apos;n. Unless you belong to Sech Zapor, I suggest you &lt;i&gt;leave.&lt;/i&gt;
At least I&apos;m trying! If you&apos;re through with insulting me, you might be able to help me...
It was...
[LOHSE] *Tell the dwarf that&apos;s preposterous. Ifan is your lute boy!*
*You mutter an old shanty under your breath. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Should I soon lie at the bottom of sea, wouldst Duna carve out a marker for me?&apos;&lt;/i&gt; You clench your eyes and brace for impact.*
I knew you&apos;d do the right thing, Lohse. In fact I never doubted you.
Black Ring Mirror
Protector
*He places a palm on Lohse&apos;s forehead; she falls to her knees, seemingly overcome by some unseen force.*
*The skeleton holds up his book in one quick, frustrated movement.*
Gateway
Please forgive my little deception, but I feared you might not be quite what you seemed. These are dangerous times.
*He goes back to sleep.*
So this is it. This is what you wanted all along, isn&apos;t it. You wanted me to bring you here. And then you wanted to take everything for yourself.
*Mourn for Lohse.*
*Lohse&apos;s eyes are black. Saheila&apos;s fingers are white under her grasp.*
*Tell her there&apos;s one more thing she should know before you continue. You&apos;re not totally, well, &lt;i&gt;alive.*&lt;/i&gt;
Amulet of the Rose
*One chunk of meat after another is ripped from you until there&apos;s only organ and entrail remaining. Yet you still feel tooth and claw as they skate across your bones...*
*Tell her not to be rash - you simply want fair compensation.*
Get away from me, you ass.
You don&apos;t have nearly enough coin to buy my silence!
*Tell the child you can&apos;t explain an aeon of elvish culture to him now.*
*Tell Zaleskar that the only thing Borris squeezed was your patience.*
*Ask what might be on the other side of the hatch.*
Farsight
Step back, step back... you tall things don&apos;t know your own power!
Witch Location
If&apos;n the poem be true, then maybe humans ain&apos;t so arrogant. Still got my suspicions though.
N-no, please! Help! Someone, &lt;i&gt;help!&lt;/i&gt;
*Relent and tell him who you are.*
Let&apos;s not do that again any time soon, hmm?
*Tell him you&apos;re impressed. Ask how you can help.*
The wrongs of the Seven shall be put right, thanks to the God King...
[ELF] *Respond as is the custom: &apos;I see the good in you.&apos; Ask how she came to be injured so.*
*Catch your breath, and say that you saw... &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;... terrible things that you can&apos;t even describe...*
THOU SHALT ANSWER FOUR QUESTIONS. ART THOU READY?
*Beg the judge&apos;s pardon and say you&apos;ll gladly wait your turn.*
*Tell her to squeeze back.*
It is the Magisters who destroy. Who separate the spores. &lt;i&gt;Anger&lt;/i&gt; them.
*Tell you what? Insist he explain himself.*
Death prowls above. Ascend only if you seek it.
Devourer&apos;s Blessing
We told the Magisters that Voidwoken destroyed the caravan. The Magisters suspect the dwarves of inciting the Voidwoken attack.
But not all. The Nameless Isle had vanished. Although only open water remained, ships would steer clear. None of the captains could articulate why. Those who ignored their instincts never returned.
The Temple of Amadia
Enough lies. Enough &lt;i&gt;farce&lt;/i&gt;. You&apos;ve riled the beast. And the only cure for the affliction... is &lt;i&gt;blood.&lt;/i&gt;
