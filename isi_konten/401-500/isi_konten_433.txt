Leave my stuff alone.
A ghastly weapon. But to have it and not need it would be preferable to needing it and not having it...
&lt;i&gt;Ngh...&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm. That dose proves quite alarming for my... &lt;i&gt;normal&lt;/i&gt; subjects. I&apos;d forgotten that you are - well, anything but normal.
Her voice: it sounds so familiar somehow...
She was a woman worthy of our respect and admiration. Let&apos;s honour her even in death, for we owe her our lives.
Bruno! Buddy? Buddy! My... my mate!
*Turn to walk away. You&apos;ve had enough of this drama.*
Well... good, I suppose...
Or, indeed, you could stand there gawping as if you were a cow ordered to dance a reel. It is a masterful performance. I would applaud it, but- well...
...before I tried my little poison routine, I thought I could tunnel to freedom there - the soil&apos;s loose in that one spot.
T-there&apos;s none left... our bowmen, our casters... they all died before...
*Tell him the Sourcerer is right here, hiding in the open.*
*Move to attack.*
*The dwarf trails off as he takes in the sight of Beast. His face goes from soft to stern, and your dwarven companion looks to you for guidance.*
*...and with a start, you realise where you must go next. You speak the command to the Lady Vengeance - and another chapter begins.*
Indeed not; you are I. We are one. And we are not -
[MYSTIC] *The spirits here are troubled. Tell him to think carefully about his next step.*
Yes! I&apos;m surrounded by inferior creatures, none of whom recognise my greatness!
Of course.
At least, until your gorgeous self opened the door. Now we just need the Source from your pretty little corpse, and then we&apos;re free...
Well if it ain&apos;t so-and-so! Ha - just kiddin&apos;, Sebille. We&apos;re good together, like sea salt &apos;n&apos; taties, or jam on sweetbread. Y&apos;care to team up? I&apos;d say your stew could use a bit of Beastly flavour, if ya catch my meanin&apos;.
My life and my liberty, remember? I need a yes or a no.
I give you a chance, and you blow it!
You&apos;re the right sort for downstairs and no mistake! On you go, on in!
Ancient Lute
Interesting. Most fellow dwarves prefer drinking chants to the...fine art... I offer. But I see it. The redness of your nose, the lilt of your gait. &lt;i&gt;Drink can get the better of you, yes?&lt;/i&gt;
I reached a new level of mastery over my Source powers, thanks to a Lone Wolf assassin called Ryker. My destiny beckons.
Couldn&apos;t add custom image. The file is probably corrupted. If you&apos;re trying to add a JPEG-image, try to open it in an image editor (for instance Paint) and resave it as a JPEG.
Just like me. Just like you.
When you see something like this, you&apos;re almost inclined to forgive the Magisters for trying to solve the problem. &lt;i&gt;Almost&lt;/i&gt;.
The best Magister is a dead Magister. You have my thanks, whoever you are.
These can only restrain his power for so long. Be brave.
It&apos;s you... I remember your face in the darkness. You... you &lt;i&gt;saved &lt;/i&gt;me.
*Laugh and say that he&apos;s already safe - you&apos;re his &apos;shield&apos;, remember?*
Silence.
There&apos;s a dome fit for a god.
*Say that Magister Harrick died violently with the scent of cinnamon in her nostrils.*
Can&apos;t help you leave, but I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;know how you can escape. At least for a few holy minutes. Go on. Down the hatch. You won&apos;t be sorry.
I see you.
*Shrug and say you have no idea, but you overheard a dwarf saying that he got away.*
We read a book reporting on the failed exorcism of a child. It seems that the demonic parasite was too strong, and that all traces of the child&apos;s soul seemed to have faded from sight.
*He stands stock-still, then collapses into you. You nearly lose your footing with the weight of him.*
*SNARL!*
*The dwarf hums the tune back to you and breaks into a huge smile. He shakes your hand, unwilling to interrupt the song, and keeps humming.*
Bleedin&apos; snake...
*Sebille looks your way; in her soft cat&apos;s eyes you can read the prospect of tender days that might have been.*
Encumbered
It certainly has that air to it, but I would make a terrible guide.
Ancient Generator
Decomposing Marksman
Heh. Don&apos;t thank me. Not while &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;thing&apos;s still knockin&apos; around yer nut.
But this is the best time of all. You, just dancing a contract right into my lap. What else are friends for?
Last One Standing
*The vulture drags its talons across the altar, scratching deep into the surface. You brace yourself for an attack.*
Applies Blind and Suffocating
*The Scion&apos;s gaze turns to you, her surprise supplanted by rage.*
*As she pushes off of you, she reaches lightly into your pouch. She stands up, straightens herself, and skillfully tucks some of your gold coins into her waistband.*
You really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;Godwoken.
Paladin Loremaster Olyvie is dead.
Right? And yet their hearts beat on!
No more choking. No more silence. You&apos;ll never be a slave to a Magister again. Now go and make them pay for what they&apos;ve done.
That&apos;s really not how this is supposed to work, kin.
Quit bugging me!
One doesn&apos;t have to see the Void to feel it lurking. &lt;i&gt;Everywhere!&lt;/i&gt;
A paltry consolation at best.
Look out - intruder!
*Promise him that you&apos;ll find a cure and take your leave.*
*He looks back down at his map, but then seems to change his mind.*
Magic and metal, like most of Dallis&apos; designs. Metal keeps it locked; magic makes it work. That&apos;s all I know.
Creates a steam cloud. When targeting a character, deals [1].
*Ask what he means. What drudanae?*
Bow your head - please! If we chant the Endless Prayer, the next Divine will ascend!
She screams and screams and screams and never stops the screams. The roots quake and my bones quiver and still the screaming...
Now then, where were we?
Will try to charm all in a [1] radius.
This is taking too long. I&apos;d better see some results soon...
*Say that you had a run-in with her wife.*
When you&apos;re a bastard kid growin&apos; up with a prim &apos;n&apos; proper princess, you&apos;re ballast. Only thing that ever kept Queen Lora from dumpin&apos; me was Justinia herself. That was... before the change, &apos;course.
Unf. That is one beautiful man.
Let&apos;s go check out the island. Get away from the shoreline, maybe hear some more freaky voices, eh?
Mordus offered to help us with our Source powers if we&apos;d eat the heart of a Voidwoken. We took the deal.
We defeated Dallis and her forces in battle. A great feat indeed.
Your death is beneath my notice.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast behind. The Magisters of Driftwood will have to solve their own problems.
*Tell the rat it should go if it absolutely feels it must. Sometimes you must reach for your destiny, no matter the risk.*
*The blade quivers as Tarquin nears it, and hums a response: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Anan, falen riveil. Amadio v&apos;lucio de an mey dritta dumoreis.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Yes - savage is just right. They care for gold - not life. Saheila is taken to Fort Joy - and the wolves steal her from there.
I do so love the smell of Deathfog in the morning.
Press [LeftStickPress] to activate or deactivate &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Selector Mode&lt;/font&gt;.
*Shake your head in exasperation. Why would she remain loyal after they kicked her to the streets?*
*Say that on the contrary, recent events are weighing heavily on you.*
Well. That&apos;s that taken care of, whatever it was. Moving on.
Spook
Corpse Pile
Please, turn away. You will find no Divine light here to guide you.
&lt;i&gt;Do I know...?&lt;/i&gt; I was the High Cryptographer here - those locks are &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;creation! Now that I&apos;m dead, nobody shall be able to overcome them.
Should you have given your soul and sealed the Veil?
*Keep silent and kneel to your new Divine.*
*Say you&apos;re ready.*
In a vision of the Hall of Echoes, the thing inside me gave me the power to bless others.
*Ifan looks at you askance, then doubles up laughing.*
Zarphian Chook
Intelligence Lowered
[SCHOLAR] *Get straight to the point - ask him how to get into the Council chambers.*
I... I recognise the device on the table there. I need to talk to her. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
Magister Carin&apos;s Shield
*Tell the rat the things at the bottom of the steps are most definitely dangerous.*
What is it? What? If you keep disturbing me like this, we&apos;ll never know. I was so close! So &lt;i&gt;close!&lt;/i&gt;
I am well versed in such things. I, my brothers and sisters studied the wonderous, the arcane, the malignant... easier to fight evil forces when you understand them.
All this talk! Why don&apos;t I just show you?
[BEAST] *Scoff. Sounds like a bunch of mystical nonsense.*
*The dwarf stares at you, his mouth agape.*
*Yes, dismiss the squirrel.*
Curious... perhaps. Yet perfectly innocent. I am beholden to fate and coincidence just as much as you are... now that&apos;s enough of this suspicious talk, wouldn&apos;t you agree?
Captain&apos;s Earthshaker
I don&apos;t doubt we can. At very least, you can expect a warmer welcome than you ever received in Fort Joy.
Stardust
*...then indicates for you to help. Together you send Sarias to his final resting place.*
*Say you haven&apos;t found her yet, but you&apos;re not giving up.*
Can be used for backstabbing.
I&apos;m going to send you to Fort Joy, you horr&apos;ble Sourcerer!
This elixir temporarily coats you in an invisibility spell. The medium-sized bottle appears to be empty, but...
What&apos;s this then? The Paladins resorting to bringing in &lt;i&gt;outsiders &lt;/i&gt;to try and decipher my work...?
You&apos;ve been talking to that snake Jeth, haven&apos;t you? I don&apos;t know where he gets these obscene lies. It&apos;s sick! Totally sick. To torture a mother so...
Dorian Gall asked us to kill his father-in-law, Micheil Ros.
Sure! Oh... hold on. Mabel said that was disgusting. So probably no. Yeah, no.
Drudanae Addict
Explore the inner vault.
*Move in close and caress his beard. Perhaps he&apos;ll get the hint.*
*Ask about Alexandar&apos;s intentions for Source wielders.*
*An ancient curse escapes from her lips, spoken so forcefully that for a brief moment all light recedes into the webs of darkness.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve been sent after the queen.*
Private Chamber Key
Huge Earth Resistance Potion
There ain&apos;t no way I&apos;m helping the likes of you, ya judgemental git!
*Put your hand on his chest and stop him.*
We told Marg that Grog was dead. He rewarded us.
*An enigmatic smile is your only reply, as if to say: not &lt;i&gt;yet.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Share with him the good news: the Doctor is dead.*
&apos;allo!
*Smile softly and reach out to touch Fane&apos;s face.*
[1] increases your ability to hear and spot (hidden) things in and out of combat.
*He picks you up with arms strong enough to move boulders, kisses you eagerly, and lays you down upon your back.*
Elf Warrior Nikolay
*The servant hums and gurgles, then yanks its head back. Its arm juts out suddenly, pointing at a hatch on the floor. It remains in that position for several moments before relaxing.*
Spirit of Lennard Rawl
Encrypted Book
Is it not enough to do it to save us all from darkness? Very well, do it for power.
*Before you go on, ask who the prisoners in the cellar are, and why they&apos;re here.*
You do it!
*Explain that you had no choice - it was you or them.*
*Apologise and turn to take your leave.*
Mark target enemy. If they die in the next 2 turns, you are healed and receive damage and Armour bonuses. If target survives, they receive the bonuses and caster receives damage.
My parasite gave me Spirit vision so I can speak to the dead and Source Vampirism so I can consume their Source.
