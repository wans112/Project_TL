*Noting the Voidwoken don&apos;t seem to register his presence, you tell him to keep doing what he&apos;s doing.*
A Cryptic Letter
*Tentatively ask to cross the bridge.*
*Your power flows from your chest and into your hands, green tendrils of power slithering from your fingertips across the shrine.*
Your actions led to this moment, and all the moments in between. Every purged Sourcerer, every family torn apart by Void, &lt;i&gt;all of it.&lt;/i&gt;
Rubble
They become nothingness unless we find our Scion.
Dear Rhalic. Dear Lucian. Save us from this hell.
I am the Scion of the Mother Tree. Her heart speaks through me.
Good heavens, do they? Not too regularly, I hope...
I am stronger than this - this demon! Do you hear that? I&apos;m stronger than you!
I haven&apos;t felt this free in a long time... not since before I joined the Magisters.
You should hope I find nothing unusual here...
May the tides take me to the Halls...
*The notice reads: &apos;Warning! Do not enter! Crime Scene!&apos;*
Is that so? I must say you surprise me. But then again I always suspected a bit of the poet behind potentate; the sentimentalist behind the strategist.
*Wonder how she ended up as such a terrifying monster.*&lt;br&gt;
Run away, everyone! Run away! The mist of death! THE MIST OF DEATH! CAN&apos;T YOU SMELL IT?!
*Tilt your head and raise an eyebrow.*
And to think I always figured wolves to be smarter than most land dwellers. Pity.
*He stares at you, face cold as graveyard clay. Despite yourself, you shiver.*
*Prevail upon his honour.*
*He snarls in silent rage, the green haze curling from his nostrils... and then is gone.*
Zanisimo&apos;s Finest Green Tea Leaves
Alas I cannot say who he was. But I can say &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; he was: a holy man! A stranger showing kindness to strangers - exemplifying the teachings of the Divine!
*Tell him you discovered the White Magisters in the Blackpits were working with the Black Ring. Together they found a mass purging device - similar to the one used to turn people into Silent Monks.*
&lt;i&gt;Shoo!&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm. A monument to dwarven lives lost.
*Reach out to her. Is she alright?*
I&apos;ve heard you don&apos;t know when to keep your weapon sheathed. Funny thing: I&apos;ve got the same problem!
*Say that you truly hope the power you seek never corrupts either of you to that extent.*
Explore the vault.
This is not your business, long pig.
Dallis&apos; little necklaces &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;lovely, but not quite in vogue where we&apos;re going.
Drop it!
Very well. You&apos;re not one of the Advocate&apos;s pets. But my warning still stands:
Please *cough* please! Healing... I need healing!
Good news, mortal! You are standing in the presence of one blessed by your Gods! I have even been granted powers divine. Naturally.
It&apos;s quite *pssskkt* simple. Defeat all others.
Think they&apos;ll ever catch up with us?
*Cough and cover your nose and mouth with your hands. Skip introductions and tell her the corpse at her feet can&apos;t account for such a powerful stench.*
Talents
On your guard - there&apos;s someone out there.
I doubt the priests took any of this lightly, but they did what they thought was best.
*Tell her no elf has more claim to the moral high ground than any other Rivellonian.*
*Ask who you&apos;re talking to.*
Oh goodie! You&apos;re a good... whatever you are. Wait a minute, what &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you? You don&apos;t smell like you look! You smell... rotty.
Please, good lady! The spear - seize it and pull! I can nearly taste sweet air once more...
*Insist. You&apos;ve ways of making people speak.*
*Implore him to slow down. Who&apos;s this &apos;she&apos;?*
Target is blocked!
*Allow her last memory of Raedalus to appear before you.*
*Shake your head - idealism exacts a price. A very high price: consume the spirits&apos; Source, all in one go.*
Romantic
My thanks. Both Justinia and I can rest safely. Well - as safely as this Void-ridden world will allow, at least.
*You approach a figure wrapped in robes, hunched over in prayer at the base of the statue.*
&lt;i&gt;Our master thanks you. Seek out the consulate.&lt;/i&gt;
*Hack!* I got my eye on you, half-stack. Don&apos;t try any of that Source business on my watch, or I&apos;ll do to ya what the Hammer did to that traitor!
But... they&apos;re still inside. Their true souls. Uncorrupted. I feel them still, I see them still...
Damage Types
Poisoncloud Arrow
*Charge in her direction. This ends now.*
Dwarven Statue
My pockets are lighter; a thief must roam.
Over many brutal decades, Braccus&apos; tyranny spread. His hunger for Source and political power drove him to develop heinous devices and magic heretofore unknown. He punished the living with death, and the dead with undeath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many attempted to stand up to him. Wizards, philosophers, scholars. But it was the Order of the Source Hunters that ultimately forced Braccus Rex to atone for his sins.
HOLD [Button1] TO SEARCH
Hmm. The destination pyramid doesn&apos;t answer the call. Is something blocking it?
*Declare that you have nothing to hide. You did what was right.*
I was a fool to treat you with leniency - no more!
Moving Wall
Yes, yes, I&apos;m sure you will. Now lay DOWN! You! Missus! I&apos;ll thank you not to provoke my patients. And that&apos;s a courtesy I&apos;ll only offer ONCE!
*Tell Tarquin about your experience in the Surrey tomb.*
Game Master Inventory
Spider
Together, we failed. But still &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; try. Alone. Unless...
*Ask her to trust you. She should go find her people.*
*Promise him that you won&apos;t tell the Magisters, but you &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;need him to stay there for now. You&apos;ll be back.*
It&apos;s been a while hasn&apos;t it? Since your heart leapt in your chest because of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; feelings. Since your hands reached for something delicate to &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; touch.
Sprinkled Egg
*Very well. Invite Saheila to speak.*
*The spirit of the cultist turns to you, head bowed low in respect.*
Item Unknown
*Beast runs a hand along the shining plaits of his beard and looks at you, saying nothing, for a long while.*
Help my Daddy, please!
Attack_Ranged_4
Even in jest, one&apos;s true self may be exposed.
Journal
*Will... will the tails be involved somehow? Better stick around a bit. Strictly for educational purposes of course.*
What is it? I&apos;m going to wind up out on my ear if they think I&apos;m spending all my time talking to you...
And what would it matter now?
*Tell her you have your limits, but she hasn&apos;t crossed them yet.*
*He raises his sword.*
I know you, Beast. Come to me. I alone know your worth.
Malady&apos;s trip to Adramahlihk&apos;s home plane didn&apos;t happen.
Fire Totem
*He grasps your ribcage with strong warm hands. You feel yourself lifted from the very earth into some other realm. Ifan&apos;s fierce dark pupils fill your vision.*
Eternally engaged in prayer to a God who may or may not hear.
*Say you&apos;re as ready as you&apos;ll ever be.*
from clipboard
I never imagined such a well-read mind could be so &lt;i&gt;feeble. &lt;/i&gt;Could it be a simpleton is touched with Divinity? The Gods really&lt;i&gt; are &lt;/i&gt;cruel.
*Leave this fool be.*
A bribe, eh? Off to prison with you, where you can think on what a stupid mistake you just made.
We hear your footsteps - you move like the living. Come closer...
I pray for release. For Eleanessa. For all of us.
A battle lost; a war begun.
And I...
Constitution
Hail Storm Skillbook
I came all the way from Driftwood, but I never expected to get stuck like this.
I told you this lizardling wronged me, yet you deny me a chance for retribution?
Forest Spider
Well... why not. Go ahead.
All gone... All gone...
Y...yes. Sourcerer! Liar! BARK!
The expected answer. Which does not, I hasten to say, make it a disappointing one. So very few of us understand the true nature of ambition. Of power. You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; ambition and power.
Magister Borris
[RED PRINCE] *Fine, yes... Tell her fine is silk. And servants. Fine is claret in golden goblets. You long to be fine.*
[SEBILLE] *Respond to the guard with a traditional elven greeting, and say that you wish to see your fellow elves.*
Third time&apos;s the charm.
Well who wouldn&apos;t be?! Don&apos;t you know what an honour it is to squire for the likes of Gareth...?
A man of principle. I get it. Wonder how you&apos;ll feel when whoever did this does it again.
...mind helping me?
Zorl-Stissa alone has been my guide. The other six can rot. I follow her, like she follows &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
*Gareth pauses.*
[LOHSE] *Laugh and tell him this is the first time he&apos;s paid attention to you. Why would you listen to him now?*
*Say they were lucky to survive.*
Beetle Talk
Yes, ancestor. Show me. &lt;i&gt;I want &lt;/i&gt;-

Swamp 01
[LIZARD] *Ignore her challenge and state that she&apos;s showing a shocking disregard for the imperial laws of hospitality.*
Ring Of Intelligence
*Say that you&apos;d like to hear the riddle again.*
*Tell him that choosing something is quite different from having it forced upon you.*
I am Master Tremly - curator of the gallery. I&apos;ll be here at your service of course as you carry out your studies - but there&apos;s time for that yet. I&apos;m closing for the night, as I said.
Now, now. As long as you&apos;re here... this ought to be an education for all of us.
Now, I must spend the remainder of my days seeking to undo what has been done.
Farewell, Master. Our paths diverge here.
Magic Wall
*Take pity on her. In her apology you find salvation. Release her to the Hall of Echoes.*
*Say yes, you knew him. But the two of you were never close.*
*Reach out with your power, grab a hold of the ghost, and consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
You can&apos;t turn hostile while the other player is in dialog.
If you&apos;re here for the wedding, there&apos;s been... there was... ahem. It&apos;s over now. So be on your way.
Mindex II
Strength
You think you can sway me with mere words? With charm, or threats, or half-baked attempts at reason? No - before you even opened your mouth, I had made up my mind.
Find out what happened to Raedalus.
Thank you for bringing Queen Justinia&apos;s letter to my attention! Soon she will hear The Hammer fall...
*Energy pours into your body, scalding hot. As you burn, it forges a new strength inside you.*
To a grenade maker, fuses are an abundant pleasure: fuses to be bought, fuses to be found, a whole world of fuses! Of course, the REALLY fun part is lighting them.
...I say she&apos;s a&lt;i&gt; demon.&lt;/i&gt;
Ah. Our weak spot. Well, I suppose I can play along.
a character
I ain&apos;t intolerant. Yer the intolerant one.
You won&apos;t be the first I&apos;ve killed...
*Wonder what&apos;ll happen if you show up at the Sawmill with him...*
Charm target non-allied character, causing them to join your side in combat for the duration of the status.
Do you think I&apos;d fall for that? Please.
*Nod. You did.*
*Drop to your knee and whisper a prayer to the Goddess.*
*She eyes you curiously.*
*Tell him you&apos;re not here to make friends and to run along.*
True Brew: Puffball
That you would even ask such a question of a stranger already in your debt! There is much goodness within you, but this task would not be easy. Radeka is a canny one, cat to your mouse.
[Translate43_4ba00a75-af1a-4a9d-96d7-e96536c51a8c]
[IFAN] *Tell her that you can &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; them, and it brings you great joy.*
