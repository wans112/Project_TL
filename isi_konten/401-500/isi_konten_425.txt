Don&apos;t rub your eyes after picking this one up. It won&apos;t be the end of the world, but it&apos;ll sure feel like it is.
*Ask the goddess who she is. Who is this woman you&apos;ve been seeing in dreams?*
A kinder word earlier, and he might still be alive. This is on us.
I suppose that&apos;s how evil survives. By being beautiful.
I just can&apos;t remember...
But threatened by the Void, they rise together...
Fair enough, my good fellow. Fair enough! The cheese vendor is who you&apos;re after, over by the Good Counsel School. She&apos;ll tell you what you need to know about these thieves of yours.
Heart Of The Mother Tree
Conjure two linked gateways that allow any character to instantly travel between them up to four times.
Stand back, lads! The merc here&apos;s going to show us how it&apos;s done! He&apos;s going to bring the Sourcerer out unarmed. Because &apos;tween you and me, if he comes out here armed, we&apos;ll kill him on the spot.
*Attack and get it over with.*
When I opened my eyes, I knew I was no longer the same woman. I&apos;m more. I&apos;m a people: its fate and its future.
Not to flip your flops or nothing, but &apos;tis more that my boss Lohar is &lt;i&gt;against &lt;/i&gt;Magisters than &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; Sourcerers, if you know what I mean.
Bloom of Mettle
The Void &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be overcome, and you &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be the god of gods.

Give me your map. I&apos;ll show you where we were operating - where I think Mordus will be.
Speak with Delorus.
Please. I will not survive forever here. Neither will she...
Should I partake of the leaf, prince, we will both know what it is the spirit of sleep wants us to tell you.
*Take your leave while the leaving&apos;s good.*
*Tell her &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;should buy &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;a drink, if she knows what&apos;s good for her.*
Magical Yew Longbow
*Say you do. Say you will.*
*Tell her the disturbing truth; the prisoners were used for grotesque experiments by an agent of the Black Ring, operating deep beneath the city. The prisoners are all dead.*
First Aid
*Say that if it means that much to him, you&apos;ll do anything to reunite them.*
I didn&apos;t hurt you, did I?
*He takes four quick steps, moving light as a dancer, and catches up with you.*
Mmmm, delicious. Their Source is so... exquisite!
I&apos;ll never best that painting, and now it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;destroyed!&lt;/i&gt; How can I go on...?
I look forward to the day when your kind are gone from this place, and gone forever. Good day to you.
*Tell him to shut his mouth, you&apos;re in charge now.*
*You feel the power deep within the jar, but so does the collar around your neck. It burns, constricts, and almost pulls you away. Defeated, you seal the jar, and its Source, once more.*
Not all our enemies are of the flesh. You will have to do battle with as many spectres as men if we are to survive.
Remember what I said, stranger. Interfere with Paladin business at your own peril.
*Ask what he means - you&apos;ve never met before.*
*Tell her you can always keep the potion.*
Maybe you&apos;re right. Why risk more lives if the Voidwoken will kill him for free... okay, we&apos;ll call off the search!
Oh... just... fixing this little device here.
*Stop him. You don&apos;t want this to happen on your watch.*
You are not my only follower in this city. The master of this house serves me.
These must be the remains of that lizard spirit... just as he said...
Someone has taken a great interest in Dallis...
What do you take me for? We are talking about &lt;i&gt;Divinity &lt;/i&gt;here, not some bauble to be bestowed on whomsoever buys your lies.
The Advocate died before he could help us unlock our Source powers.
*Before you leave, ask that her Royal Highness repeat her tale of woe - the people should know of their princess&apos;s plight.*
[NOBLE] *Say you stem from true nobility. You know every king and every queen, but they can hardly expect you to keep track of every upstart in the land.*
&apos;BE YE WARNED, BEYOND LIES DEATH.&lt;br&gt;The Divine Order Guarantees It.&lt;br&gt;Heed The Word of The White Magisters.&lt;br&gt;Turn Ye Around.&apos;
You must be chained! &lt;i&gt;You must be chained! YOU MUST BE CHAINED!&lt;/i&gt;
Ugh - how right you are. I&apos;m not wasting any energy on killing a bit player like you.
Then you may be glad you have escaped the curse of Braccus Rex!
Unusual Blade
Let&apos;s think twice about this. I don&apos;t fancy facing a mob of Magisters.
Ungh, you&apos;ll... you&apos;ll have to excuse me. I&apos;m a rather *groan* unenviable state. What was &lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;that stew?

*Ask how Jonathan ended up on the floor of this shack.*
&lt;i&gt;Hahaha! &lt;/i&gt;She&apos;s gonna be so mad - &lt;i&gt;hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; - when she finds that money gone! &lt;i&gt;HAHAHA! A-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&lt;/i&gt;
*Remark that if Lucian knew the damage that his decrees have done to the world, he would surely release Arhu from his oath.*
No! You mustn&apos;t! He tears my heart and soul, memory by memory... I am... I am... nooOOOO!
Spirit of Mudbarrow
What, have you been living under a boulder? Alexandar&apos;s the Divine&apos;s only natural son. Good man. I&apos;m proud to serve him.
*Say &apos;Loman&apos;.*
Godwoken should be able to *rsskKTt*  enter without issue. It seems that the Academy has been impeded due to neglect...
War Axe
Crippling Blow Skillbook
*Beast glances at you and mutters.*
This looks like the cargo of the Peacemaker.
*Ask Gareth if he can&apos;t just do it himself.*
Then you are my next meal - and a crunchy one, at that. My soul is within my grasp!
*This is the heart of the Mother Tree, the centre of the elven universe. It looks... &lt;i&gt;unwell.&lt;/i&gt; And the strange device sitting inside it only accentuates the impression of ill health.*
Well, do you know how to enter the Council?
Barel Move
Better not be givin&apos; boss a hard time.
Provides an aura to allies that allows healing for [1]% damage dealt to Vitality with direct attacks.
Well I&apos;d certainly hope so. Your not jus&apos; a man - you&apos;re a myth! Those royal flakes should be quakin&apos; in their boots the second they hear your name.
*Tell him you don&apos;t want a drink - you want to know where the groom has gone.*
Conjurer
*Say she likely knows more than you do.*
Dwarven Sword

Slane the Winter Dragon destroyed the Shriekers.
Tombs
...thank you... now I swim... monsters... gone... swim... free... swim... forever...
Godwoken. Of course you are here. Was it you that unleashed all this Sourcelight?
Honey
Where&apos;s... where&apos;s the other grownups? You said you&apos;d bring them too!
Fine. But avoid trouble of trouble. You don&apos;t want to upset the wrong people.
*She narrows her eyes and pins you with a bitter stare.*
Stow your weapons. I don&apos;t want trouble.
Did yeh think your merry band could try to toss Justinia into the sea and the clouds would turn t&apos;rainbows? A storm of yer makin&apos; still rages. And whenever word of yer deeds reaches her ears, lightning strikes.
*Gareth motions to you, and you step onto the boat and venture into the unknown.*
Frances Grund
You&apos;re mistaken if you think I am so easily persuaded. And you can think about that in a prison cell.
&apos;Course I do. Know him top to tail, don&apos;t I.
Meistr Siva instructs me to record my research before I conduct any experiments regarding  Godwoken ascension. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ritual itself is quite simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Place a single piece of blackroot in the ritual bowl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Draw blood with obsidian lancet (your own is most convenient) and sprinkle it upon the root. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Set a flame to the bowl and its contents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Ensure that you have sufficient Source. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Inhale the resulting smoke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) Beyond this point, nothing is known. &lt;br&gt;The ingredients for this ritual are not rare per se, but may be difficult to procure. I am fortunate that the Meistr&apos;s Source fountain never runs low, so it is simple to gather Source. Blackroot, however, is another matter entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The root grows in the forests to the north-west of Driftwood. It produces no poison or thorns to guard it, but all manner of creatures stalk those trees. It is wise to quickly grab what one needs and then return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I pray that my experiments here pave the way for future scholars. Or, should I succeed, to allow &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; to be the equals of Godwoken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Apprentice Talich
Th- that is not important. Just please, tell me, do we have an accord or not?
Undeployed Nailbomb Trap
Of course they do! How can you live without trust and companionship? They would do anything for me, and I would do anything for them in return.
I... I don&apos;t know. Something stirs in my memory. Something long buried.
A &apos;mistake,&apos; huh? That &apos;mistake&apos; could make quite an ally.
Have you ever faced a Voidwoken?
*Make your presence known and ask them what they&apos;re hiding from.*
Ah, guilty as sin, I see. Well, I doubt anyone misses a thief like you.

*The hooded man exudes an aura of restrained menace. As he raises his head to speak to Ifan, the hood falls back, revealing the gleaming bone visage of an undead. They speak in urgent whispers.*
The dreamer was killed before I could tell him about the voice in my dreams. Just my luck.
*Resist.*
*Ask the rat if he&apos;s still being sarcastic.*
Back! &lt;i&gt;Back! &lt;/i&gt;Don&apos;t come any closer to me!
[JESTER] *Ask if Gareth is covered in slime and boasts a set of razor-sharp mandibles.*
Questions first - extortion later.
[ELF] *Ask how a sacred ancestor tree came to be turned into a Magister war vessel.*
A potion that enchants and strengthens your Physical Armour.
The Mother would have to choose sides.
Eyes sharp.
Do you remember what it is like at home? The quiet, oh, the quiet...
Depth of Field
I like horses. They&apos;re kind. So the dog comes in and sits down.

The Seven Gods may be almighty, but they hardly expect to fight their own wars. Thus an order of ascetics devoted to the Seven Gods and practiced in the arts of war and healing carries out the will of the divine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These men and women are trained to transform a spartan diet of crickets and snow into the raw strength necessary to turn the tide in any holy war. They restore and regenerate their allies as thoroughly as they annihilate their foes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enemies of Source and all unrighteous magic, Clerics are the cleansing hand of the gods made manifest. For centuries, Clerics have worked alongside the Order of the Source Hunters to purify the land of evil magic.
Defeat Mordus.
