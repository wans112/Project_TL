If the Gods weren&apos;t &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;Gods, is it so important that they flourish? Could not new ones rise to guide us?
Looking for Dallis, I&apos;d imagine. I assume Kemm has a plan beyond praying for help or running the Path of Blood, but if he does I&apos;m not privy to it.
Magical Two-Handed Dwarven Axe
I have to say, &lt;i&gt;Adramahlihk&lt;/i&gt;, you don&apos;t look too good...
I&apos;m not in the habit of giving &lt;i&gt;anyone &lt;/i&gt;the benefit of the doubt - so count yourself lucky and move along.
Burning from within, the fiery heart of the phoenix has long been an elven ritual delicacy... and a test that separates the true blood of the forest from the other races.
Busy day in the garden. &lt;i&gt;Too&lt;/i&gt; busy.
Indeed? Slayed by your hand, then? The cub once pleaded with me to aid in his Sourcerer pogrom, Silver Claw. I cannot deplore your actions, as loathe as I am to admit it.
I bet Hannag&apos;d want to meet you. She needs friends. She isn&apos;t bad. All this was just an accident.
Putrid and blooming with decay, it&apos;s hard to find a single convincing reason to touch this, never mind bring it with you.
*Sniffle.* Mommy an&apos; Berry are sleepin&apos; an&apos; they won&apos; wake up!
Well then? Let&apos;s do this.
*Say yes, you have.*
I might&apos;ve been hitting the beer, but I reckon you&apos;ve had one too many spirits, eh? Eh?

I don&apos;t want your dirty money. What I want is to see you dead.
There are few weapons more vile than Deathfog - and it takes an equally vile tyrant to use it.
Alright, Godwoken. I&apos;ll lock it up again when you&apos;re done.
Deactivate
OH MY GODS STOP LOOKING AT ME YOU&apos;RE MAKING MY VENOM ITCH! Grbbt.
Although perhaps the God King will grow tired of us. Perhaps eternity will not last as long as I&apos;d hoped.
You didn&apos;t get your hands dirty either.
I saw the mass death caused by the Divine Order&apos;s war first-hand. If divinity can do the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; of that, I&apos;m interested.
It&apos;d be a hell of a lot easier if I could &lt;i&gt;find &lt;/i&gt;him. Still haven&apos;t said word one to the guy.
Souls in the maze can unlock doors. But &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; doors? We should choose wisely.

One would prefer a more idyllic setting than this, but let me regale you with a story.

[OUTLAW] *Wordless, draw your weapon.*
And you, my fellow adventurers. Together we have seen more than generations of mortals could ever see. You have seen the horrors of the Void, and I-... I have seen this world through your eyes.
A lifeboat! That means there&apos;s still a chance...
We need to take care of each other. Really.
For the Order!

Brace yourself. This might hurt.
I&apos;ll be going my own way, then. And... I&apos;ll see you soon. Very soon.
The Town Crier told us that the Good Counsel School had closed down.
What good&apos;s an outlaw who can&apos;t command the shadows? I&apos;ve dabbled enough to know I&apos;ve an affinity for the darker arts, but I&apos;m a quick learner. What&apos;s your preference?
Corrosive Touch
Source Inhibitor
She was the brutal sort. Strip-your-skin-off sort of torture. Although it might &apos;ave been better than this, in the end.
The power that they unleashed... there was nothing we could do. Only run. Shriekers, they&apos;re called. I can still hear that sound they uttered... makes my scales crawl...
On the surface, yes. But what does that mean for... well, you?

Does this mean there&apos;s no reward in the afterlife...? People go to the Hall of Echoes to be &lt;i&gt;consumed? &lt;/i&gt;We&apos;ve been helping a pack of murderers!
Dwarves Unite!
Hollow Marshes - Abandoned Camp
*Tell him to drop the bluster - you&apos;re going to stop Dallis. She will be dead or in chains soon enough.*

Everyone I know is dead.
House Interior - Well-Furnished Farm
I expected better. Alas.
*Say that you met Lord Kemm. He strikes you as more of an old warhorse than an antiquarian.*

*She closes her eyes and begins to whisper...*
&apos;fore you go, help us settle an argument.
Gods... he&apos;s dead! Magisters! MAGISTERS! A passenger&apos;s been killed!
Damn it, girl! Is there nothing I can do to shake you free of your demons? To undo the ever-creeping dominion of that scar?
Lemme think about that now too. Yeah... hmm... uh... okay... right... Here we go:
No. Lucian was weak. Lucian was mortal. You are neither. You will rise as the Eternal Divine, or the world will fall to the Void.
*Step away and draw your weapon.*
Time left:
Well, if this don&apos;t take the cake.
*Give the dog a friendly pat on the head and turn away.*
I&apos;m not sure even my voice knew the terms - it was all very hush. Suspicion is she&apos;s promised to give up something powerful, though.
*She pauses for a moment. If she had eyes, you&apos;re sure she&apos;d be wiping them.*
Back for a visit? I hope you brought dinner, for my princelings are getting hungry.
Leather Scraps
Give me another chance, my king. &lt;i&gt;I beg you!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you were discussing the shipwreck.*
If it is, it&apos;s only a little funny. But you tried, and that&apos;s something. So here. Take an egg for your effort.

Dorotya
I don&apos;t understand - why did this happen? Why wasn&apos;t the Divine here to save me?!
I&apos;d give my right paw for a taste of... *urp*... smelly mackerel. Carp. Any fish will do, really.
*Scoff. He at last has another chance to make his voice heard - and he &lt;i&gt;refuses? &lt;/i&gt;Psh.*
I thought these marshes were abandoned.
Screaming Widow
*The spirit of a dock worker thrashes about, trying to shake &lt;i&gt;something &lt;/i&gt;off of his back.*
Please. For you - anything.
At least we knew what we faced within those walls. Who&apos;s to say what dangers lurk outside them?
Flesh Ooze
Stay in this cave a while longer. Provoke Mody, the wild one who runs like his clothes catch fire. I see how you feel then.
I was just sitting in the tavern, minding my own business, and the Magisters started screaming at me! I ran and- well...
You... you &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; it. You truly &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; it! Oh, blessed be your vision... and sorrow upon the past that bestowed it upon you.
*Her world explodes...*
...it&apos;ll come back, it&apos;ll come back, it&apos;ll come back, it&apos;ll come back, &lt;i&gt;and we&apos;ll all be eaten alive...&lt;/i&gt;
*Reach into the spirit&apos;s memories...*
Please, I beg you - spare me, and I&apos;ll tell you what I know about the Path of Blood. I can&apos;t die - &lt;i&gt;I can&apos;t leave my darlings alone!&lt;/i&gt;
*He leans over and touches his multi-headed staff. Source floods through his body and it shifts, turning to a lizard, a dwarf, a human...*
[SWORN] *End this battle. The King must claim his servant.*
Good folks to have around in a crisis.
*Yet there is nothing to divine but rough bark and swollen pustules. You cannot say which elf&apos;s spirit inhabits this tree - or how it came to suffer its second death.*
And if I knew then what I knew now, Marcus, I would still exile you. You would walk the Isle of Mists to this day, stalked by demons and living the nightmares they planted in you.
You won&apos;t need to squeeze &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. And I&apos;d recommend you don&apos;t try, either.
*Tell her she&apos;s no liability to you. You&apos;re partners. End of discussion.*
