Oh, Dallis - you best be careful. You&apos;re playing with necrofire...

Use to read and learn about crafting.
Enjoy.
Voidwoken attacked the party. The Royal Guard was here. We fought the monsters but people died. What would you have me say?
Deal with the wargs.
We let Lohar live. We can lie to the Magisters and tell them he&apos;s dead.
Then you know I mean business. And you know what&apos;s at stake. Don&apos;t disappoint me.
Only one way to find out, as far as I&apos;m concerned. Let them be born!
*The spirit manages to draw his sword and utter a challenge - though not one aimed at you.*
I will not fade... The sun shall find me...
*The bull shakes itself. Swallows the cud. Clears its throat.*
Are you really gonna make this so hard, freshie?
We set sail and put Reaper&apos;s Coast and the Black Widowmaker behind us.
Now show me why they call you the life-shaper. Go on, go on, make love to me!
I owe my life to the holy pilgrim! You may have a doubter&apos;s heart, but I know a miracle when I see one.
Yeah. Wow. What a shock. Yeesh.
*Ask if it&apos;s Arhu who is the subject of her protection.*&lt;br&gt;
No info
locked
*Tell him to recite the ballad of the Doctor.*
*Say you&apos;ve been looking for a cosy little spot like this, away from the din outside. Ask if you might have leave to stay awhile.*
The bastard is a Master no longer.
*Apologise.*
Bone Colour
Teeth in the sea. Teeth in the swamp. Teeth in the air...
We let the Advocate live.
It has become obvious to me that the better I get to know you, the more I wish I were still sealed in a tomb.
*In an instant, Lohar goes completely white.*
*Leave the raft be for now.*
You were infected. You were defiled. There was no room for me to speak, with that creature you have inside you bellowing at every turn.
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrroawr.
No deal.
Turn into a Lizard
You&apos;ve got nerve, strolling around a restricted area!
WaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhhHHHHHHHH!!!!
*Ruffle Sir Lora&apos;s fur, the big softie.*
The kitchen? You&apos;re certain...? But that would mean the cook is behind all of this!
*The hound paws desperately at its snout. It winces as it draws blood from its wet, black nose - and continues scratching.*
The scent of Deathfog drifted from a statue in Micheil Ros&apos; garden.
Go way. Wanna sleep. Pfft.
Elite Paladin Marksman
Rivellon will thank us for our deeds, my brothers and sisters.
Probably!
I&apos;m sorry.
*Tell you&apos;ve never heard worse excuses in your life. Lucky for him, you don&apos;t care what he did.*
I&apos;ve had enough of this!
[Scratched into moth-wing parchment with snake venom, this is the fabled Scroll of Atonement. With this scroll, your sins can be absolved in the eyes of the Divine.]
You can&apos;t be serious. What could possibly be more pressing than this? This might be my only chance to be &lt;i&gt;free.&lt;/i&gt;
The Sparkler Card
Hmm? Goods. Ah. Yes, yes of course, have a look...
No... no! Aldus!
Scrapbook
*Say that without a doubt, it&apos;s a great big dollop of double cream on top.*
Rusted and salt-encrusted, this key looks and smells like it&apos;s been marinating in some none-too-fresh tidepool for a few centuries or so.
You look lost. Also you look slightly evil. And you look kinda... dangerous... so I immediately wish I hadn&apos;t just called you evil. Don&apos;t hurt me, I can&apos;t help myself!
Well. I trust the real me lives up to the fantasy me.
*Saheila keeps her expression carefully blank. Sebille turns away from her. She looks... troubled. She mutters under her breath, too low for Saheila to hear.*
A prisoner is gone!
May Amadia curse his soul for turning creation into destruction.
I can see the dead now? That&apos;s bound to be awkward in no time...
*You mutter a hallowed lizard rhyme under your breath. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Come dragons, cleanse with holy fire this failing heart in times most dire.&apos; &lt;/i&gt;You clench your eyes and brace for impact.*
I think he&apos;s an idiot, and when he gets back I&apos;m going to tell him so.
Neat pages lined with dense handwriting.
*Sallow turns away. You&apos;re done.*
Should any such place exist, it would be very opportune indeed should you stumble across any correspondence between Lohar and Queen Justinia.
Can you feel it? The twisted pain? It&apos;s everywhere.
I can&apos;t believe I fell for it.
[HUMAN] *Say that there are lots of humans around this place - he must be confused with someone else.*
Now if you would do me one service more: stand aside.
*Mordus looks at you in shock. His skull twists into a mask of rage as comprehension dawns and oblivion opens before him.*
*Lay your hand upon his pate, and thank him for his prayers.*
I guessed as much. Blood even colder than those scales would imply.
*Kneel respectfully.*
Grog&apos;s Monopoly
Cap&apos;n Ablewether
I did it. I killed those Magister pigs, and fed their sorry carcasses to all of Driftwood. It&apos;s all they deserved.
There may be tablets detailing the history I&apos;ve missed, useful relics, or ruins showing signs of destruction. Just &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;hint to help me make sense of it all.
*Bearing in mind Amyro&apos;s predicament, order him to hand over the drudanae.*
The divinity held within Lucian&apos;s cadaver belongs only to the King&apos;s chosen. Perhaps, if you abide by his word, you may yet be among them.
Ah. Well. You make a convincing argument. Off with you.
*Say that you hardly noticed. You couldn&apos;t take your eyes off him.*
*Stand back, observing the scene. She couldn&apos;t be saved after all.*
Elemental Devil Growling
In each major hub, you can now find a mysterious vendor selling exotic and potent artefacts. These artefacts can upgrade a character&apos;s own gear with immense power, bringing them up to the player&apos;s current level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
*Ask why it wants to know.*
Blessed Oil Flask
The amount of Experience required to level up.
Fine Jacket
I... I was not worthy. I betrayed my own nature. I made a pact with a demon, so I would triumph over all others in the Council... but the Gods saw through my ruse, and I was rejected.
*She pushes you back and starts unbuttoning your clothes. You help her out of her dress and soon you&apos;re in each other&apos;s arms again, naked.*
*Bow your head. Some part of you understands - it was the burden of command.*
I can see that.
Water Essence
I&apos;ve heard half-witted ogres give better excuses than that.
There&apos;s a ladder right over there. You can go straight down!
Braccus&apos; shield is cold to the touch.
Shield Upgrade
*She lays a hand on the wand and you see Source streaming down her arm and into the rod. After a moment she breaks her grip with a gasp.*
I did nothing wrong - all I wanted was to further the knowledge of the Eternals.
*Say you aren&apos;t sure. This is happening faster than you thought it would.*
Hovering
*Ask her what a &apos;Scion&apos; is.*
She&apos;s stronger than you know! Stronger than you know, girl. And faster too!
Rafnar
The timing is... worrying. But I trust the Paladins. They&apos;ll turn Arhu up in no time.
You... you&apos;re right. I&apos;ve lost the key, but I&apos;m... I&apos;m sure you can handle it from here. I don&apos;t want to see Donna like that again.
The Magisters have kept ledgers with all known Sourcerers. Especially the powerful ones not yet captured. They would be an invaluable resource.
Lord Arhu is deep in prayer and is unlikely to answer a knock at his door, no matter who knocks... or how hard.
*Turn and walk away.*
[This report goes into great (and unpleasant) detail about Toyseller Sanders, who is apparently using Source to animate puppets for all kinds of grotesque purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the usual protocol would be to transfer him to Fort Joy immediately, the report bemoans the fact that Toyseller Sanders designed the Path of Blood in Arx Cathedral, so he is untouchable for fear of angering Arhu.]
Storage Room Key
Chestnut
The vile thing knew us! Much good did that do it.
*The deep bow doesn&apos;t falter. She gazes into the darkness that curtains your face, and smiles.*
*Turn to take your leave.*
*You turn and see Fane. Not a skeleton. Not a mask. Not some shadowy, hooded figure. You see &lt;i&gt;Fane.*&lt;/i&gt;
And Justinia? is she... is she safe?
In an underground laboratory, we found a skeletal lich.
Knife Throwing Wheel
*Say that a Rogue is exactly the type of companion you&apos;re looking for.*
Fine. But keep yourself out of trouble. You don&apos;t want to upset the wrong people.
Tactical View
Handmade Leather Armour
Help the Red Prince.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source. It&apos;s just a dog.*
[UNDEAD] *Demand to know how he could tell that you&apos;re undead.*
*Say that between the God King and Adramahlihk, the demon was a wise choice.*
*This notebook is filled with meticulous notes, observing the traits and habits of the &apos;mortal races.&apos; It details the foods they eat, the clothes they wear, and their speech patterns. It also includes some rather confused diagrams of their &apos;mating habits.&apos;*
Boots of Contamination
Dead Magisters. I wonder who did this.
The monks that... that did it. They&apos;re still in the house, spreading their rancid smell. Paladins came to clean up the mess. In the name of Lucian, they say, and they seem to believe it.
Neat Blade
It seems to cry out to be made into fish pie.
You too, Julian! Show them how it&apos;s done, man!
See that you do. Go in Amadia&apos;s grace.
Max Weight Of Stolen Items
I&apos;ve got sword fighters, mages, archers - all willing to fight by your side if the price is right.
Brittle Spear
*What you do next decides your own fate, and the future of the world.*
Enough. I will have your head for that!
*Say you&apos;re looking for a Witch - someone who can drain the life from enemies from the back line.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82] gold)
*Try &apos;letmein&apos;.*
You &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; her but a mirage, ephemeral as smoke, but you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; better don&apos;t you? Know with all your soul.
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;COAL KISS&lt;/b&gt;.*
Probably flows straight into the river.
Weak faith enables tragedies such as these!
Forest - Small Cemetery
*Tell him it&apos;s not for lack of trying: Alexandar&apos;s one tough bastard to kill.*
Keep quiet. Lord Kemm is speaking!
*Source washes over her: a wave over a single flame, but unlike last time it seems to have precious little effect.*
*Nod. You will.*
Tryin&apos; times. You understand. Can&apos;t afford to waste time on Jane Know-nothing.
Have you ever wondered if the dead would rather be left in peace? I know I would...
*The spirit casts her eyes about wildly, a prisoner of forces she does not understand.*
*Draw your weapon and be done with them.*
After we killed Kemm, the Doctor gave us an appointment.
The face is familiar. What&apos;s left of it. He was aboard the ship.
[LOHSE] *Tell her you are losing time, but not too much. Not yet. Ask her if you&apos;ll ever be free of it.*
Poster Board
*The door does not open. A creeping sensation comes over you - as if the door were &lt;i&gt;examining &lt;/i&gt;you. And then the sensation darkens - as if it does not like what it finds.*
Marcus? Marcus Miles?
