First night here. Don’t seem like it’ll be too bad. Found somewhere quiet to sleep. Brought enough dry bread to last me. When all this blows over, I’ll be happy to say I survived it in comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group of dumb brutes shook me down for my bread. Will have to get smart if I want to eat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Met an old fisherman named Rad. Taught me how to make a net.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rad’s gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dumb brutes took my net. At least the meanest one got took in the night. Getting hungry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I always was a strong swimmer. Waters around here are pretty glassy. Can’t be much more than a few miles to shore, can it?
*The ship groans and trembles as the sea-dragon wakes.*
*Recognising him as a being of great power, lower your eyes and wait for him to go on.*
Who cares about that stuff? Bodies are cheap. Souls aren&apos;t. That thing can use my body, but not my soul.
*Ask the tree to tell you about the battle in the mill.*
*Turn away.*
I am wrong to accuse, I see. Off you go!
*Say you&apos;re here to take revenge on those who would behave - or speak - barbarously toward your kind.*
Impostor wolf! Ripper of flesh... Taker of names... &lt;i&gt;Accurse him!&lt;/i&gt;
Consider me moved, Godwoken. Your mercy is boundless.
It&apos;s still there, Quercus. Do you think it&apos;ll ever leave us in peace?
How can... how can this be...
Then &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; go to the Mother Tree!
Target terrain to create a smokescreen. Deals no damage.
[SEBILLE] *Repeat the words. Their meaning doesn&apos;t matter, only the results.*
Good. We&apos;ll need a sense of humour to get much further than this.
Don&apos;t taunt me, ben-Mezd! My strength is your strength, my loss is your loss.
*The heroes of Driftwood lie at your feet - dead for good, this time.*
*Say you&apos;re surprised Malady let her aboard. That sounds dangerous.*
You are a &lt;i&gt;curious &lt;/i&gt;thing, aren&apos;t you?
How many times must I tell you - I have business in the Blackpits. We should head to the excavation site there.
Healing wounds is one thing, but if Gareth doesn&apos;t find those weapons, we&apos;re as good as dead...
There is a place of safety in the city. A single facet of the Ancient Empire, yet far from its majesty. I must see it for myself.
*The creature shudders, trying to break free of its restraints, then lowers its head in exhaustion.*
He hurt me real bad.
*The boy&apos;s frown turns to a smile, and he beams like the summer sun. Your heart stirs at the sight of an innocent child confined to a cage.*
Getting your mucky little boots in all the wrong places, hmmmm? Don&apos;t you know, my little pepper pot, that it&apos;s ever such bad manners to enter a queen&apos;s boudoir without permission.
I killed Alexandar. Contract fulfilled. I didn&apos;t get to question him first, but I came out alive. This is good. Now to escape the island.
*Shake your head. There can be no mercy for one sworn to the God King. Not even her.*
Watch what you&apos;re doing!
All these people... all these people... all these precious people...
Heater
But... my husband has his secrets, and I am reconciled to that. If clandestine meetings and secret locked bedrooms in the attic keep him happy... well, a comfortable status quo is not to be sniffed at.
*He nods and smiles silently -  then thrusts his lips against yours. Suddenly, you are at sea, lost in that sumptuous beard, and rocking to the rhythm of the waves. You pull out of the kiss and the vision...*
Since when does Reimond hire &lt;i&gt;mercenaries?&lt;/i&gt;
Ever? Ever ever?

*She laughs - a laugh like ringing bells...*
&lt;i&gt;The Doctor thanks you for your assistance on Bloodmoon Island. In thanks, he offers some words of advice - look to the lizard consulate. Powerful magic can be found there...&lt;/i&gt;
Hey! No weapons allowed here!
Yet we all have a &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; dwelling within us. To expose it, all you must do is look into my ring and tell me what you see there.
Like I said - that ain&apos;t for your ears.
[LOHSE] *Tell him he&apos;s working himself up over absolutely nothing.*
The Doctor
*The spirit vanishes. Whether he fled to the Hall of Echoes or elsewhere, you cannot be sure.*
I don&apos;t want to die screaming. I&apos;d pray to Damian himself for a blade between the ribs.
*Tell her to hold on: death is not the answer.*
With Justinia dead, the kingdom was free to advance.
*She sighs.*
*Say that you thought you had already killed him. &lt;i&gt;Twice.*&lt;/i&gt;
*She studiously turns her back on you.*
It takes bravery to try and strike down an evil king. Perhaps &lt;i&gt;especially &lt;/i&gt;one you once supported.
With a small band of elves, Ifan ben-Mezd re-planted the lost elven forests.
I take it you seek the Master; I take it you seek he who cannot be found. But then again, you&apos;ve found me, and it&apos;s entirely possible for you to find Roost.
Patchworked and overlapping chainmail scales give this masked helmet the unmistakeable provenance of the Ancient Empire.
Ssso, you are of sssome use after all! To arms, Black Ring! We shall do the Sssallow ssservice and take the temple!
Fall to your knees; embrace Divinity. It&apos;s the only way a new Divine will ascend and end these troubled times.
I met with... a madman I shouldn&apos;t wonder. But powerful he was too; a power we now share.
My. Buffalo is. Fine thank you.
*Ask what his &apos;business&apos; is with that body.*
Good. &apos;cause whatever&apos;s going on with you and your &lt;i&gt;passenger &lt;/i&gt;is beyond me.
Nothing here.
We gotta do this fast. Let&apos;s get those bugs out of here. You in?!
Stay back!
*Say that you seek the Council - does he know how to access it?*
*You pull the gore-covered dagger from his chest and his body slumps to the ground, limp and still.*
*Gentle heat warms your hand.*
My legacy lives on in the armour. I grant you might beyond compare, champion! Use it to cleave through the world.
*Tell him to spit out whatever it is that he&apos;s insinuating - there&apos;s no time for guessing games.*
...what I&apos;m thinking.
Story mode
[UNDEAD] *Alright. Yes. But, you tell the rat, you&apos;re not creepy, just... private.*
Here, lizardkin. I bet you know your sconces from your seascapes. Wanna trade?
I&apos;ve said all I know... please...
You know your place, Sebille. You know your god when you see him:
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The prey offers itself. Take it. The prey... the prey offers... take it...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Bird Leg
[NOBLE] *Tell him to get with civilisation and speak Common.*
*He clicks together two halves of some type of gauntlet sitting in his lap, and turns his full attention to you.*
Gaudy Chest
*Hear her out.*
Hang on, you! You poke about in all the wrong places. Let&apos;s see what kind of goodies you find in a prison cell, instead.
*She gives you a cool and steady look.*
*Wink, and insist you deserve a break. You are the same race, after all.*
Yes? Have you killed him?
What is it that they say - that I got ants in my pants? Something&apos; like that, anyhoo. And they&apos;re right: I gotta get movin&apos;, before I yank every whisker outta my face. And you&apos;re lookin&apos; pretty fidgety yourself. Care to team up?
A nice spot to pass the time, waiting for the end.
You may appreciate the delicacy of my herbs and solvents, elf, but do be graceful in your browsing. I cannot risk a tainted tincture.
*The spirit fades away, a look of anger and indignation on his face.*
Where&apos;s the Dreamer and the bones? They&apos;re all supposed to be together.
Stickies Overview
A tale too preposterous to be believed, and yet so ultimately, so undeniably true once told.
Haha! Well of course she does.
Aww. What a snooty thing to say! Let me tell you somethin&apos;: Sometimes you make enemies jus&apos; by bein&apos; who &apos;n&apos; what ya are. That&apos;s all it takes. They&apos;ll hate you &apos;cause of the Source in ya, or &apos;cause you got scaly skin, or &apos;cause ya eat limbs...
*Ask what it was like to be a prince.*

I trust you. I trust your judgement.
Dead Knight
Lucian told me. He&apos;s alive. He&apos;s being held by traitors - Seekers, and Arhu too - but you and I, we can save him. Join me, and we&apos;ll save the Divine together.
It&apos;s... it&apos;s too late Marcus. Someone has already activated the machine...
*Tell him you&apos;re fine.*
This is how we worship. This is not just an arena, but a temple too.
But now the tables have turned. I broke my shackles. And when I finally find him, I will make the Master sing a very different kind of song...
Pitch-Dark Tunnel
Ha! And what difference do you discern between demons and gods, scholar? In this world ruled by the Divine Order, could things be any worse if so-called demons were in charge?
*The Magister doesn&apos;t notice you. Her thoughts seem far, far away from Fort Joy.*
*The dwarf starts to sob quietly with his hands pressed over his ears.*
The most delicious-looking Dwarven wedding cake you&apos;ve ever seen. Which isn&apos;t saying much...
Deft Defence
I met Malady near the arch-demon Adramahlihk&apos;s house. She has found a way to his home plane - there, we may be able to weaken him.
*She gives you a sharp look.*
Face
*Despite the all too unsettling nearness of these horrors, he looks poised; regal even, and wholly at ease.*
Of course! &lt;i&gt;Companion&lt;/i&gt; may not be the exact right word for it though.
[OUTLAW] *Tell him he needs to grease your palm if he wants more out of you.*
*Tell him you&apos;re not a child and have no interest in children&apos;s games.*
*Passionless, unblinking eyes regard you from beneath the Silent Watcher&apos;s cowl.*
Enter.
And now, Godwoken, I uphold the final act of my oath: your execution. You can forget about finding Lucian. Believe me: No good comes from our so-called &lt;i&gt;Divine. &lt;/i&gt;
*He snarls and the tendrils about your mind snap to you - you understand in a moment that you should be grateful that he doesn&apos;t take you now and torture you until you beg for death.*
Savour your freedom, Lohse. Take some time and find your true self in that busy mind of yours. Adramahlihk may no longer reside there, it&apos;s finally safe to explore the uncharted corners.
*The Soul Jar cracks open, flooding you with its power.*
Big Dwarven Mace
[BARBARIAN] *Give him a crooked smile and tell the Magister that when you&apos;re done with him, he&apos;ll wish you&apos;d just killed him.*
*The painted man harumphs.*
*Kill the lizard lover.*
I feel it deeply, your longing. The longing of the lost.
A bulb a day keeps the creatures of the night away. Or so they say. Good weapons and a keen eye are probably a better bet.
Take the soul. Leave the jar.
However, as you lack the blinding aura of the Divine, or the purpose of one soon-to-be-Divine, I assume you haven&apos;t fully mastered the secrets of the Source.
Source Hound
[VILLAIN] *Mock him. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are the killer of cities. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are the thief of the world. &lt;i&gt;He &lt;/i&gt;is nothing but a long-dead monarch with an undeserved god complex. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are the real deal.*
You bring Saheila back to me. My littlest one. My dearest one. You give me &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
I&apos;m going to do what I can to stop the queen. I suggest you try the same. Get to Arx. End this - before Justinia does.

Party&apos;s over, if that ain&apos;t obvious. Best go home.
Camouflage Necklace
Sure, sure, &lt;i&gt;luronta&lt;/i&gt;. I will be here, should you wish to hear a poem...
The Death-that-Feasts is Duna&apos;s gift! Blasphemy deserves no mercy.
You&apos;re telling &lt;i&gt;ME.&lt;/i&gt;

We should&apos;ve been more careful. We should&apos;ve been certain we could save him...
