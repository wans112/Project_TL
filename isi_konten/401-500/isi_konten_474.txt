And what do you call the destruction of an entire forest and all its inhabitants?  They call it &apos;progress&apos; - we call it genocide, the same as you. You reap what you sow, isn&apos;t that right?
*The owls shrug their fluffy little shoulders at each other, then eye you beadily.*
There. I pray that will be enough.
Really? Well I&apos;ll be. No reason to stick around here, then. We got business to attend to!
You see... The thing is...
A Magister ghost mentioned &apos;plaques&apos;. A hint at the code for the encrypted hatch? There are plaques on the walls of the dormitory.
If you were not who you claimed, it could have been a disaster.
*Ask him if you look like the kind of person who trades fish for a living.*
Mask of the Shapeshifter
*Tell the Red Prince you had a... rather mystical experience. You actually met with your god.*
*Her eyes flick over to the smouldering ashes once again, her head held at a despondent angle.*
*A mischievous grin appears upon his face.*
*His eyes flash open!*
*Say you seek to make amends.*
By Lucian&apos;s sword, these Magisters are madmen! Are you alright, elf?
Gems
*Ask what the Magisters have done.*
*Tell her that you should cast her into the swamp. She deserves nothing less.*
We left Fort Joy behind. We will never know the rest of Sech Zapor&apos;s story.
Still, you should leave. If anyone else comes in there will be more questions. And if you see our friend the groom, please do me the favour of cutting his head off. Go on, get gone.
You are not Damian. You are not Damian...
*Sigh* I&apos;ve already read this!
No-one is anyone&apos;s type until they are, chief. Broaden your horizons. You might like what you see.
*...in ecstasy.*
*In her enthusiasm she gives you a hug, then quickly reassumes her royal composure.*
*You hear a noise - a chant? A hymn? - as somber as thunder and as profound as a funeral dirge. It is first a chorus, and then a single voice, one you know all too well.*
*Attend to the queen. Is she hurt?*
Indeed, our time in the darkness is done. Now you are all that stands between us and freedom. And you shall not stand long.
*He runs his knife through another fish and flicks the blade, sending a shower of guts to the ground.*
*Look around and say that this place doesn&apos;t look much like a royal court... nor does she look much like royalty.*
Gods, fine. Take it and go, and if you say a word to Julian or anyone else, &lt;i&gt;expect trouble.&lt;/i&gt;
*Thank the rat for her delightful story and share a few of your own.*
Voidwoken! Monsters? Our babies? &lt;i&gt;All &lt;/i&gt;our babies?
Tell me, have you anything to report?
*Thank her for the advice.*
I believe so, Lohse. But... we won&apos;t let that happen.
You can do better than that, can&apos;t you?
*You open your mouth to ask a question, but she names her price. It&apos;s too low. It&apos;s too good. You can&apos;t say no. You reach for your gold...*
You&apos;d suppose we should work as one, but no. The God King loves to play his game of favourites. Kemm was promised a place at the table, and he&apos;s doing what he must to secure it. Alone.
As the old human saying goes: &apos;I have a bad feeling about this.&apos;
Amyro is free. Saheila will be pleased.
Suffice to say I need to speak with Griff. So let&apos;s find him.
Happy to.
*Diplomatically raise your hands and say that she doesn&apos;t have to tell you anything yet... she just has to listen.*
A service, have you done me. I thank you. As do the seas, who miss their slaver.
If you&apos;ve business here, get on with it.
UI Radial Up
I can&apos;t abide interruptions. Let&apos;s wait for them to leave, and then we can try again.
This can&apos;t be it...
You don&apos;t say.
Indeed. The entire world trusted to one pair of mortal hands.
*He bows his head, then leaves for the Hall of Echoes.*
No!
Thank you for your help, friend.
Not that I had any inkling of runnin&apos; off. Not when I&apos;m so close to ending Justinia&apos;s plans once and for all. Deathfog... I can barely breathe to think of it.
*This satisfies him. He points you down the rise to where a skirmish still continues...*
That is the wrong answer!
Paladin Footman
*You behold the face of a nightmare. Soul-sickness incarnate, the rotten flesh of the world&apos;s most shameful desires, an all-knowing affliction; the God King&apos;s pallid envoy, walking the world as &lt;i&gt;the Sallow Man.*&lt;/i&gt;
Hollow Marshes - Ruined Castle
Another day, another cock and bull story. Come on. To prison you go.
*Lohse spits at your feet and stares at you with a curled lip.*
*Say that he should stand down before he embarrasses himself. You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the Red Prince, and you are here in magical disguise.*
*Tell him you&apos;re sure you can work this thing out. You&apos;re both Godwoken, after all. Brother and sister.*
[SCHOLAR] *Study the chest. It seems different, yet familiar.*
We found Source weapons in the basement of the Fishworks.
Like I said before, I need to ascend. I don&apos;t stand a chance against this demon otherwise.
Come, Godwoken. It is time to see just how &apos;awake&apos; you are.

At last! I was sure I&apos;d die in that wretched place.
I am convinced. If this is a trick, you regret it surely.
piercing damage
Mother,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You always taught me to do what I believed was right - and so I have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a greater freedom here than I&apos;ve ever had. A greater hope in a hopeless world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, I hope you&apos;ll not only forgive me, but join me, too. You are always welcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X
Huh? What&apos;re ya doin&apos; here? Thought Griff had you strung up by your ankles in the kitchen.
*Tell her no; you&apos;re ready to leave.*
*Smile demurely. He&apos;s holding a golden courtesan.*
Dagger
*Tell him that he&apos;s washed up on the shores of Fort Joy: this is a prison, he&apos;s not &apos;traversing&apos; anything.*
*Ifan looks at you with suspicion, then shakes his head and looks away.*
Master is master. He wants you to go to him. West of here.
Not the future, no. But I can read the past in flesh, just like you. And I&apos;m quite good at it too.
Hehehe...HE. HE. HE!
As you wish! I wish you luck, then. You will need it!
*Tell him you&apos;re his reason to keep going, if he wants it. Nod your goodbyes and walk away.*
[IFAN] *Say that you consider &lt;i&gt;&apos;mercenary&apos; &lt;/i&gt;a compliment, not an insult.*
*You&apos;re curious - what does he hope to find at this &apos;excavation site&apos;?*
Purged Gareth
We have the key to Lord Arhu&apos;s private quarters.
Listen to me: I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the House of Shadows. This was my role. I saw the great games in motion: allowed them their flux when they advanced for good, cut them short when they advanced for evil - even if it meant &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt; evil.
*The dwarf bellows out to all within earshot.*
*And as the Sallow Man releases you, you hear the wordless question: &apos;are you not happy now?&apos;*
Too little, too late. I&apos;m already dead!
Get back. Get back, I command you!
Steady on, guv! Didn&apos;t mean no insult by it! Can&apos;t help but notice, is all.
The portal will return you to Rivellon. May the fires that burn within you remain mighty, dwarf!
Sebille
*She spots a fellow lizard in your company and sighs with relief.*
*You&apos;ve been patient long enough. Lunge forward and bury your needle deep in his head.*
Self-Built Full Plate Armour
*The surface of the mirror is smooth and unblemished - not a single speck of dust sits on the black glass.*
The annals of elvendom are written in flesh - elves eat of the dead and absorb their memories. Now, the elves are in peril. An unforgettable hero must rise.
Mmm, that smells... revolting. *Munch munch munch*
*Call out to Daeyena - can she hear you?*&lt;br&gt;
I see your mother raised you very well indeed. You and my Kniles would get along. Nice to see an unfamiliar face. What brings you to Driftwood, darling?

It was daunting. It was too much. It was &lt;i&gt;far too much&lt;/i&gt;. It was...

[SCHOLAR] *Say you studied at the prestigious Champion Academy in Aleroth. You are hardly an amateur!*
Captive Deep-dweller
[SOLDIER] *Note that he doesn&apos;t seem too pleased with his posting by the sounds of it...*
*Absolutely not. You refuse to be an errand boy.*
Trampled Corpse
*ICE-COLD WATER is suddenly thrown in your face, tearing you out of your stupor.*
The Doctor sends his regards. HehehehEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEEEEE.....
Regardless, we must stand against them. I alone have the magical expertise to stop them!
Best enjoyed near the hearth on a rainy day.
As beautiful as always, if unwilling to whisk me away from this place.
*Spit on the ground and walk away.*
With Rivellon fries at the ready, you&apos;ll have more friends than the man with many cheeses.
[FANE] *Nod quietly, wondering what he would say if he knew the truth of Seven?*
So many books, and such little time...
*Demand that it explain itself. You were betrayed, not the other way around.*
Do mortals really call him &apos;the poet&apos;? I have seen better metre scrawled on outhouse walls.
*Say a &lt;i&gt;Magister &lt;/i&gt;is a bad person in red.*
Trust me: With Bishop Alexandar in charge, things&apos;ll get a lot better from here on out. He&apos;s Godwoken, y&apos;know.
*Let Ryker finish the ritual.*
[BARBARIAN] *Roar at her out of sheer boredom. Enough talk, already!*
Hmm... smarter than you look. Congratulations.
These thin, smooth sheets of metal could perhaps be used somewhere else.
Lizard&apos;s Scythe
Dallis and her Magisters attacked. Malady can save us, but we must buy her time.
Your turn. Spit spot!
*The enormous stone slab is covered with cryptic engravings, obscured in places by smears of dried blood.*
Mister, have you seen our friend Joe?
That&apos;s step three out of three. You&apos;ve still got some ground to tread before we get there - but don&apos;t worry. It&apos;s for the best.
But do not let that dismay you. You will save these mortals, you will save this world, you will save me, the last of your true kin. And you will become a God.
*Let him go.*
You don&apos;t look lost at all.
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
*Sebille holds her cheek as if dazed with pain. It looks like she&apos;s about to collapse.*
*Turn him down and take your leave.*
Lord Arhu is the Keeper. All matters relating to the tomb of the Divine are for him to decide upon - including the Path of Blood. You must seek him out and receive his blessing before I can help any further.
Turquoise
Guiding the Magister search for the Aeteran, Vredeman seems well schooled on arcane matters.
Am I indeed? On account of a dead lizard?
No. It has to be me. Come, accept me as the new Divine. I&apos;ll do right by you, you know that.
Hullo! Are you lost? Are you looking for a home?
No matter. The true reward is yet to come.
It all happened — like I knew it would…
*The laugh fades away, and the concerns of a kingdom and beyond pass between the two of you.*
Incandescent Wand
Still, you have the look of a criminal. What do you have to say for yourself?
*Walk on. This is no time for such distractions.*
You cannot speak without spewing lies. You&apos;ve earned a dishonourable death!
HA. This is really rich. You&apos;re - I just - no, you know what? You&apos;re not worth it.
