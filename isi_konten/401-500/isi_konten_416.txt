I&apos;m hardly an expert on the matter, but I&apos;m smart enough to put two and two together. Where there is an ocean of Source, there is a well for drawing from it.
*Say it was bad luck; wrong place, wrong time.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll see what you can do...*
Desperate, the people pray for the rise of a new Godwoken once more.
An enemy of the Source King, made I.
(I hope so. Shhh, she&apos;ll hear us!)
*Devour the spirit. His soul belongs to the Void.*
Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog.
Keep distant. My own demons haunt me too closely. I cannot also bear the burden of yours.
*A droplet here, a seasoning there. Was it the bloody flux... or was it &lt;i&gt;you?*&lt;/i&gt;
Set Border Style
*Ask him what happened? How did he end up trapped like that?*
Jester
Then my axe will find her neck.
Have to keep pushing, do you? I&apos;m too old for this bullshit. Let&apos;s &lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt;.
Hmm, I don&apos;t know, this is all so very sudden, and I&apos;ve my other suitors to consider...
The Future of Elvendom
*You stumble back in a blind panic. As you calm yourself, you notice the altar is changed, with a crescent moon hacked into the wood. As you leave, you can&apos;t shake the dull, thudding ache in your eye...*
You have proven yourself worthy. &lt;i&gt;Wise&lt;/i&gt;. For you.
My wife and daughter always had to compete with my work for my attention. And my work was always stiff competition.
*The spirit&apos;s wine goblet drops from his hands as he vanishes - its contents dissipate in an ectoplasmic swirl.*
The moment the Empress saw the armour, she fell in love. In that moment, she became my muse. My true inspiration.
*Lohar clutches his chest and opens his eyes wide. You approach and prepare your finishing blow...*
Leave this place. Find the mainland, where the garden of stone and death stands. Its master guards the next piece of the set.
*Blink. What&apos;s he talking about? Who&apos;s cunning?*
I know quality when I see it, and I bet you do too! Care to trade?
Please. You must go. This is no place for you.
*Ask what he thinks about Lucian&apos;s return.*
I smell Source in the air. You know something...
*Say you&apos;ll consider her request.*
The compass surely lies on the bottom, near where the ship was wrecked. Take it with my blessing, if you can find it. My sailing days are done.
*He sighs.*
...I don&apos;t like it here, don&apos;t like it, don&apos;t like it at all...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... there is something &lt;i&gt;humming&lt;/i&gt;, some fell thing, something that claws around at the edges of my senses, worming its way in...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... today I saw a glowing blue light, and it spoke to me... I turned to tell my friend, and he was naught but glowing light too, and when I screamed, he laughed a laugh a laugh a laugh so hollow and black I thought it was the end...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... I &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; it were the end...
Simone! You&apos;ll pay for that, murderers!
*Remark upon his sterling eyes. They are unlike any you&apos;ve seen.*
*Ifan scrawls something on a little piece of paper and hands it to you.*
Hall above and Hell below, worse than the disappearance o&apos; th&apos; Divine? I find that hard to fathom, much less believe.
*Kick his heel.*
Gratiana may have information crucial to our escape.
Lady Paulina Kemm
Human Skeleton
Almira revealed that she is a succubus. We had to kiss her in order to receive the Source power that she promised us, though we would be making ourselves vulnerable to becoming her thralls. We refused.
Search for the scroll and the amulet.
Don&apos;t you have somewhere else to be?
GRAPHICS
I&apos;ve got it! *Ahem*
Arx fall? Over my dead body.
Mystical Large Venom Rune
The Seekers were killed by the Shriekers.
&lt;b&gt;She cannot resist us - she is NOTHING! She doesn&apos;t even have a name!&lt;/b&gt;
Good. That hunger will drive you forward. You won&apos;t be satisfied until you take it &lt;i&gt;all.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask him how much your silence is worth to him.*
And yet when I emerged from my completely unjustified imprisonment, I found them gone, our culture forgotten, any trace of the world I knew all but obliterated.
Come on!
After it burned down, with Jahan inside, witnesses claimed that the flames were the colour of blood.
Lavish Chair
*Ask if she can train you.*
Shriekers. The snake-tongued one spoke the truth.
Title Screen
*Say you&apos;ve been through worse.*
*Whatever powers the gods once had has weakened indeed.*
Fane crafted a new Mask of the Shapeshifter.
Indeed! But if you can&apos;t hear the intelligence of plants... perhaps you are not listening hard enough.
*The tree shudders... and then screams. The heart of the Mother Tree withers and dies.*
You&apos;ve been played for a fool, little prince. She&apos;s sworn to another! That&apos;s right... Your boo is betrothed to a very different kind of king...
I&apos;ve given a few shows around Reaper&apos;s Coast. Might be you saw a poster or a flyer. Might be you even heard about the... erm... &lt;i&gt;incident&lt;/i&gt;.
You&apos;re... you&apos;re nice. Emmie would&apos;ve *sniffles* Emmie would&apos;ve loved you!
Mattress
*Tell him you assumed he&apos;d be... female.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. If Baran Levere gets revenge, it won&apos;t be from us.
Do you bring me news?
The world is in a mess - maybe the Eighth will do a better job governing it than the Seven did.
*Lie and say that as Champion of Fort Joy, she &lt;i&gt;owes&lt;/i&gt; you a fight.*
*Reach out and lay your palms upon the stone.*
Statue of Lucian
This must be the wreck of the Peacemaker.
*You recognise Daeyena, the runaway Scion from Fort Joy. Her face looks different - alight with fervour.*
This grenade unleashes a chemical reaction that does [1] in a [2] radius and can freeze all in range.
&lt;i&gt;...with you.&lt;/i&gt;
Hnnnnnuhg.
A poison elixir brewed with the yarrow flower. Supposedly superior to common poison.
While sneaking, [1] increases attack damage by [2]%. Also reduces cost of entering sneak mode by [3] AP.
I... I can&apos;t.
*Tell him you suddenly have no money.*
No.
Well, you&apos;ve heard that the Magisters were colluding with the Black Ring, right?
Seven hells, another Godwoken cut down. This mission was doomed before we ever set sail.
&apos;Mody&apos;s Place. NO grownups ALLOWED! (Except heroes)&apos;
[JESTER] *Explode in laughter and point to his escaping prisoner. A drudanae-addicted troll would make a better warden than him.*
[SEBILLE] *This is Stingtail! Confront your target: tell him to state his name.*
Guardian Lever
*Your mind churns, the imagery too chaotic to bring into focus. The incursion ends, leaving you feeling weak - and somehow exposed.*
Poisoned Two Handed Axe
Alexandar! But wait... he&apos;s too well protected here.
Don&apos;t come crying to me for help then. I want nothing more to do with you.
Would that I were like you. I feel this collar choking the life from me. It&apos;s all I can think of.
*Lucian frowns at Vredeman, then turns to the Silent Monk standing near and smiles widely. Reality sets in: the Monk is Gareth - no longer Seeker, but slave.*
I&apos;m... I&apos;m alive. I was convinced the pain would destroy me. That &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; would destroy me...
Same to you, chief. Same to you. And when push comes to shove... I&apos;ll try not to shove too hard.
Move along, nutter.
Laslor&apos;s Lute
Come to me, sweet cinnamon.
I see you are up to no good. You&apos;re under arrest!
*She embraces you in gratitude, sobbing in relief. As the tears flow, her spirit dissolves in your arms - and she leaves for the Hall of Echoes.*
*Ignore the squirrel and carry on your way.*
[UNDEAD] *Ask about the less fortunate - the undead. Did they not have a voice on the council?*
We met a boy called Han, who was looking for someone named Verdas, but arrived too late. As we could see ourselves, Verdas was beyond help.
*Reiterate that you should get going. How important can it be?*
It most certainly &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be. The Well of Ascension is a lake: a pool of pure Source in which the powers of the Seven lie united.
*Search his memory for the Chancellor&apos;s chambers.*
It is awful how he treats you. He asks so much, and gives so little in return...
Dwarven Dagger
*Pursing her bruised lips, Captain Orell glares up at the carrion birds circling the bloodied remains of her men that litter the entrance to Arx. She sighs heavily.*
*Say you&apos;re just passing through on route to Arx.*
I imagine this is what awaits at today&apos;s dwarven wedding: drink and dirt. I advise you that I am interested in neither.
The sheer corruption of it!
*Ask the Magister if he can hear you.*
Oil Carapace
*A guard rushes in front of you and, before you can flinch, the point of a sharp spear draws a bead of blood from the artery in your neck.*
Gareth did his duty. We felt it was only right that we did ours. The farm was always a safe space for Sourcerers needing refuge. They deserved a haven, and so we gave them one.
*Quietly shake your head and take your leave.*
In the dream world I learned that the House of Shadows is hunting me. I did not learn why.
Unusual Contraption
Your fear is how Roost captures you! Your fear is how they scar you! The scar makes you kill Scions. Without Scions, all elves die. If all elves die, the fault is &lt;i&gt;yours!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her the cheese vendor told you all about their little racket.*
We were ambushed by the Doctor&apos;s demon minions.
*Shrug. What can you do about a gang of vicious killers hunting you down?*
Note Found On Shipwrecked Magister Corpse
My masterpiece! My... my work!
From Physical Armour ability: [1][2]%
My surest friend is my own mind...
*The image fades, leaving only the symbol of the sun dancing in your vision. You slowly come to your senses at the temple, where chittering birdsong fills your ear.*
And you, of course, assured it! All will hear of your heroism, O prince of princes. One day soon you&apos;ll wake with a crown upon your brow.
What are you trying to pull? Empty your bags!
*Look at the dead monks littering the floor. You&apos;re not so sure Gareth is still that hero.*
Pillar of Vrogir
Nifty Sword
What&apos;s the deal? You after something?
No, Coral. Go!
Though I see you hidey-hiding behind a mask. Are you ashamed of who you are?
&lt;i&gt;...you are here for the truth... the terrible truth... the inescapable truth... that you are not enough... you have never been enough... you will never be enough...&lt;/i&gt;
Yeah, I ain&apos;t buyin&apos;. Sell me on it.
*The spirits of a Magister and a dwarf are locked in ethereal combat. Their vicious blows make no impact, yet they struggle on. Mid-snarl, the dwarf spies your presence and staggers back to address you.*
I kissed you. Has it been so long that you don&apos;t remember? Oh, I may have woven in a blessing. For effect.
[SCHOLAR] *Fascinating! You&apos;ve read about the plague known as &apos;the wet death&apos;, and never seen such an acute case.*
No! I see what you mean to do! You tell me we forgive them, &lt;i&gt;save&lt;/i&gt; them. &lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; -
Young, strong, smart - you know I don&apos;t exactly lack in qualities. Didn&apos;t take him long to train me in the arts of stealth, subterfuge and assassination.
*You feel a presence awaken within the stone. An ancient awareness reaches out to you, swirling through every cell of your body, and every mote of your soul.*
Woof! You&apos;re on the ball, but don&apos;t think I&apos;ve forgotten a thing!
*Refuse.*
Grey Cat
*Ask if it&apos;s offering to snip you free of your collar. You hadn&apos;t expected to see your neck again so soon!*
&lt;i&gt;I failed him.&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m gratified you&apos;ve noticed - even though it took the death of a good man for you to do so.
*SNARL!*
