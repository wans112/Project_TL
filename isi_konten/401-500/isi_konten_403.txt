*Glance at the woman and wonder if she seems a little... out of place here?*
Nonsense! Who else?
Spider-leg cracks etch the glass of this vial.
Magical Siege Crossbow
Foul things. They should&apos;ve stayed in their graves.
That tinkerer must be around here somewhere.
*Confront him about the pressure he put on Arhu to unseal the tomb.*
Return
*The goddess steps back and waves, the warmth of her lips still lingering on yours. Then sudden light and lightning, and you are gone.*
*Fane says nothing for a moment and just stands, staring into the middle distance.*
Heartless
Whatever happened, we ought to take care. We don&apos;t know who our enemies are.
Gregorius Swann is dead.
*Say you understand most of what&apos;s happening around you.*
Wealthy Pilgrim
The Sourcerer Higba is suspected of killing Magisters. We should investigate.
Something stinks around here.
*She smiles and gives you a long, meaningful look.*
The roads are rather dusty today, aren&apos;t they, Godwoken? May I offer you anything to drink?
Destroy an allied summon or totem. Receive their current Vitality, Physical Armour and Magic Armour.
Hur-hur. What did he &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; sssay?
*Her glassy eyes do not register your attempts at further communication.*
*Reach for your weapon. You&apos;re here to end the beast.*
*Hand the jar over.*
Dunno why those bugs didn&apos;t choose me. I&apos;m clearly the tastiest one!
Spear of Braccus Rex
*Turn to Sadha and say you don&apos;t care what&apos;s going on. You told her you loved her and you meant it.*
I saw this place when I ate the maze-builder&apos;s head.
Voidwoken. Arx used to be safe from those things... not anymore.
I&apos;ll be keeping watch on you, limb beast. Show respect while in the royal court, or you&apos;ll regret it...
Djinn
*Ask him who he means - who&apos;s the coffin meant for?*
Divine
Gold Pile
*Decide she seems unstable and leave her be.*
I used to love wandering the forests for days on end. I&apos;d swim in the rivers and forget to dress after. It was fine, I was alone.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Never mind, love.
*Tell him to fear you.*
*The woman&apos;s upper lip twitches and her chest heaves with each Gods-fearing utterance to the heavens.*
*He acknowledges your presence with a nod.*
*She draws her needle and holds it up between thumb and index finger.*
Poor little cat never had a chance here. Do any of us?
Well, well. Been caught in the act, have we? Take a step back and thank your lucky stars I&apos;m in a good mood.
*Cock your head and ask the skeleton if he&apos;s feeling okay.*
*Say you need to be going.*
Gui
Stuff. You know. Cool stuff. Mostly.
Never figured the Magisters would stoop so low. A disgrace to Lucian, a disgrace to the Order.
*Suggest there may be wisdom in doing as they ask. For the good of her people.*
I knew you&apos;d see sense. You and me, our minds are sharp. We are clarity. We are &lt;i&gt;the truth.&lt;/i&gt;
At the start of each turn, launches a fiery projectile at the nearest ally with an active Rock status.
The Master remains unvanquished. I shall need great power to overcome the scar.
Crawlers
And you react to me with this... this &lt;i&gt;violence&lt;/i&gt;. This &lt;i&gt;hatred&lt;/i&gt;. It defies logic. It defies explanation.
*You hear roaring laughter and shouts, then the hush of silence. You think you can hear quiet, choking sobs from within.*
I warned you, didn&apos;t I?! Why did the Gods choose a fool with a death wish to be their champion?!
Got a preference fer the wood I use? Subtle differences in tone &apos;n&apos; timbre. All of &apos;em beautiful in their own way.
Like a rose without its thorns, this beautiful (though neutered) object lacks the thing that gives it spirit. Unlike a rose, though, this crossbow can be mended.
Guarding the dead. An honour or a burden - or perhaps both?
The Doctor has some explaining to do.
Abandoned Box
I never knew when Hannag would come, or where she came from. She would just... appear. We&apos;d have a few lessons, and then she&apos;d be gone again, without so much as a farewell.
Doesn&apos;t this room strike you as eerie? There&apos;s a chill in the air; a deeper darkness in the shadows.
Adept Tier
Go. The cathedral awaits. Let the light guide you!
The lands outside were once green and beautiful. Until I came. Until I turned them over to him. Now all&apos;s poison and the dead are restless.
not
*He raises an eyebrow and gives you a sly look.*
Would&apos;ve been the highlight of my career, that, stealin&apos; from royalty hidin&apos; in the sewers, up to no good. They wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve been able to report the theft to the authorities! The perfect crime, that. Oh well. I had a good run.
Force Kill Party
*Well now that she mentions it, you are still wearing this Source collar...*
Back! &lt;i&gt;Get back!&lt;/i&gt; I-I-I&apos;ll kill you, just like the rest of them!
Nosecutter
The assassin&apos;s favourite nightcap, this oily black potion flows like distilled midnight.
Lucian blesses me in his own way, shadow-veil. I glide on his breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
Yes indeed. Why a lady without a proper tea set is no more useful than a party without a hostess! As long as you choose the most delicate leaves and brew at the proper temperature, you&apos;re destined for luxury.
*Move to attack.*
There&apos;s something wrong about the eyes. Are they staring into the Void... or from it?
Blessings be! What can I do for you, honoured one?
*Ask her if she truly crafted the Deathfog bomb, as Zanisima claims.*
I found a face-ripper! I can now make masks from the faces of the dead. All I need now is a Source orb.
You lookin&apos; to buy somethin&apos; or do you just want to waste my time with a whole lotta questions?
Move Item
Wands
...but it seems that you are to enter the Tomb of the Divine, and I am to help you get there. So be it.
*Place a hand under her dress and move it up along her inner thigh.*
Show Profile
*Tell her to close her eyes and keep them shut, and then you&apos;ll be gone.*
The bird complains of the cold. It&apos;s desperate for warmth.
You&apos;ve found a Blessed or Cursed surface.  These are variations on regular surfaces, that have altered properties.
What should &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;do? Oh, oh, I know.
It&apos;s... it&apos;s not... I see them all. Thousands of them. Thousands of planes, thousands of demons, millions of souls, lost souls...
You feel the anticipation of agonising death with every swing of this hefty axe.
*The boy looks past you.*
The Aeteran
*Justinia turns to Isbeil, looking for assurance - and Isbeil begins to chuckle. Her laugh is low and measured at first, but grows in magnitude until she can barely breathe.*
Indeed? Duna, if I&apos;m not mistaken. Always was rather the slow sibling in the pantheon, wasn&apos;t he?
*He takes in the corpses surrounding him. His wife lost to violence. Two of his children, slain as he watched. He tries to choke back tears, but soon they flow free, carving rivers through the grime on his face.*
*The child screws up his face and looks at you, hard. He lifts his mirror to his nose, closes one eye, and looks at himself again.*
Target group is too far away
Cockroach-chewer.
I gave them my research on the Veil. I gave them a prize to snatch from the King.
My powers have waned, Godwoken. I have no knowledge to offer.
... Octopuses? Octopi? Octopodes? *Sigh* I shall have to look that up.
Yes...
You&apos;re not entirely wrong... then again...
Zaikk&apos;s Talon
*She gives you a long look.*
W-w-well, you&apos;ll find him in Effie&apos;s Emporium, &apos;neath the Black Bull. He&apos;s a f-fine man. A little gruff, yeah, but he&apos;s the only one in Driftwood wantin&apos; to h-help and not hurt.
*Ask what truth they&apos;re on about today.*
Adept Conjurer
Sadha. The secret of my soul. I value her more highly now even than divinity.
When confronted, Queen Justinia claimed to be defending her people - by striking a first deadly blow against the Divine Order.
Could be soon! Could be she&apos;s on her way right now! I can&apos;t wait to lick her face again! She tastes just like Emmie.
&lt;i&gt;the sign is good so kill the divine pigs and kill the godwoken kill them all and then perhaps you die and rise again&lt;/i&gt;
Ah - the turncoat himself. I presumed you would honour your word. I regret the mistake.
*Suggest that it&apos;s time this bastard ceased to exist.*
What&apos;s on your mind, darling?
You&apos;re clean. Thanks for cooperating.
You soil Alexandar&apos;s legacy! The bishop was a man of action. Lazy slugs like Ghonghi will be the death of Rivellon, mark my words.
Go to the wedding.
Comeback Kid
She&apos;s holding court in the sewers, if you can believe it. Go to my wine cellar, pull out the vintage called &apos;Lulabelle&apos;. It will open the way for you.
All we know is that the House of Shadows seeks to kill you. Their motives are as obscure as their very existence, but I surmise it has something to do with another obscure existence:
They can&apos;t have gone far.
Yes. It seems you&apos;ve proven yourself familiar with sword and Source. The Raucous One would not assign the honour of Champion lightly.
This world is ours.
*He laughs bitterly.*
Let&apos;s just cut to the chase, shall we? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are searching for your Master. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; know where he is. Them&apos;s the cards we&apos;re holding, and I&apos;ve got all the aces up my sleeve.
Some of the Magisters suspect Vredeman to be a Sourcerer... or worse. None would dare confront him.
I gotta go! Mummy&apos;s calling.
Nothin&apos; useful, I&apos;d say. If we can&apos;t get ourselves outta here, won&apos;t matter either way, eh?
Magister Reimond. He bade me take the coins to purchase supplies for his journey, but I dropped it along the way. He&apos;s sure to think I stole it.
Speak with Paladin Hardwin.
For services rendered, the Sallow Man promised death and everlasting life. Ultimately, he only offered death.
Range: [2]&lt;br&gt;Chilled makes target less resistant to water spells, but a bit more resistant to fire spells. Chilled has a negative impact on movement. Chilled targets that get chilled again, turn frozen.&lt;br&gt;Can target terrain to create ice surface or freeze water.
Drowned Sourcerer
Next time, feel free to walk through the front door, though. You&apos;re always welcome here.
Corpse
*Share some good news: you know of an entire sanctuary dedicated to Amadia!*
Natalie&apos;s Fear
A child&apos;s wooden block, scuffed and worn from happy hours of play.
BakaaaaaaAAAAAHK!
A very sturdy, short stick, and not as rotten as most of the other sticks around here. Useless to the untrained eye.
*Tell her you found the eggs, but they were transformed into Voidwoken.*
Fastened tight!
We&apos;re pretty formidable these days. Might as well hunt that thing down before it causes too much trouble.
Take one more step. Go on, give me an excuse...
A man named Sanders was the engineer who designed the Path of Blood. He works as a toyseller now, right here in Arx. Tell him that I sent you - he will give you what you need.
The Arena of the One
*Say she&apos;s fine, and she asked you to help secure his release.*
Ouch. &lt;i&gt;Ouch.&lt;/i&gt; You talk like I&apos;m some cat burglar, slinking around and snatching jewels. But I&apos;m in the market for something... bigger.
Characters in the cone that are Frozen and below 10% Vitality shatter and instantly die. Otherwise they receive [1] and become Frozen.
*Wish him good luck and bid him good day.*
*Say you never know... Alexandar survived his first death, maybe he&apos;ll survive his second too.*
