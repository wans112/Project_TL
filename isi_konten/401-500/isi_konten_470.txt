I&apos;ve survived more attempts on my life than you&apos;ve got names on your arms, girl! I ain&apos;t so easy to kill...
Saheila. A young girl here. I am her protector and she is... she is everything. A ruler... a seer... a knower... a &lt;i&gt;child&lt;/i&gt;. She cannot *cough* cannot be lost here.
*He pockets the coin and gazes dramatically at the ground mere inches from your feet.*
[SWORN] *Croon that she is clearly the apple of the God King&apos;s eye. She must know &lt;i&gt;something.*&lt;/i&gt;
Things can only get better &apos;round here. They can hardly get worse.
*The spirit blinks, then looks around her, listless and confused.*
*The figurehead takes the form of a sea-dragon. At sea it danced on the waves. Now it seems to bow down - as if resigned to its own fiery death.*
was turned over to the people of Driftwood
*Nod to Lord Kemm. He knows what he&apos;s doing.*
*Say that you&apos;d like to trade with her.*
Like I should believe you. Your guilt is obvious!
Mordus&apos; House
Draught of Speed
Safe to say we won&apos;t be goin&apos; anywhere, now.
As far as I can tell, he&apos;s doin&apos; the queen&apos;s dirty work. And when we get off this tiny speck of an island, I&apos;ll be gettin&apos; me some answers.
And I have you to thank for it? Then thank you I surely do.
Further immolation unavailable!
*Take your leave.*
Lucian said, &lt;i&gt;&apos;Let my word be a light on your path&apos;. &lt;/i&gt;I will trust you. I will let you light my path.
The third Passion of Lucian. Now this is ART!
*Raise your eyebrows and tell him that&apos;s far more people than you&apos;ve killed.*
*Nod a farewell.*
Find Justinia&apos;s agents.
Harriet
I hope you found something- or someone- useful inside...
*Say you were all recently ripped from your homes and have little of value to give.*
...Brother Trent, Sister Agnew, Brother Crvissa... forgive their errors, and smile upon their triumphs. Hasten them from this foul place to the Hall of Echoes...
*Your Source link to Jonathan is suddenly severed. His spirit stands before you, head held high, face contorted in anger.*
We... we don&apos;t have anything to give, ma&apos;am. But... Gwydian&apos;s studied with that Hannag woman. He can probably teach you something...
A sad moment, this. To some extent.
Flesh Slug
...free!
Who knows. Anythin&apos; that gives away what Mordus&apos;s been up to. Prolly got all sorts of tricks for coverin&apos; his tracks, but the goons downstairs should sniff out somethin&apos;.
Upstairs, on the second floor. Her name is Zharah. Pleasure is her business. Enjoy the experience of a lifetime...
I see the truth behind your lie.
Have you resumed your senses, Godwoken? It is not too late - my master&apos;s offer remains true. Aid for aid. One boon for another.
There is no leaving. Don&apos;t you know what&apos;s outside the Fort?
*The object repeats its indecipherable twaddle. You can glean no more from it.*
Show Gareth the way. Help him be the hero he&apos;s meant to be.
*Thank her and be on your way.*
*Point out a contradiction. How can someone rebelling against power be so keen on becoming Divine?*
*Stay quiet.*
I am sworn to the king... and sworn I remain, Godwoken. I owe you nothing.
This medium-sized potion smells faintly of old books and is capable of boosting your intelligence.
&lt;i&gt;(Shush, Mabel!)&lt;/i&gt;
I mean - ain&apos;t that the wonder of it? I&apos;m prepared for most anything - the undertow draggin&apos; me off, or the royals catchin&apos; up, or releasin&apos; my people from their misery.
*With Hannag as your guide, you reach out into the woods. The heartbeat rhythm quickens as the creatures of the forest sense you pulling at them. You draw their Source towards you.*
*You&apos;re here for Brahmos, so out with it!*
*Beast shifts his weight from one foot to the other, nodding his head with every squeak of the boards. He greets you exuberantly as you approach. Over-exuberantly, even.*
I see continents dotted with mighty cities, and shimmering along the soft curve of the sea&apos;s horizon, I picture the palaces that formed my paradise... lost.
*Ask if he&apos;s the father of the bride, and inquire after his daughter.*
I do not say this out of malice. I say it out of love.
What have you done? I was so close... I could see the light! I could almost feel her touch again...
Sewn Scale Gloves
*Say you do.*
Altar to Vrogir
So you say.
*Tell her she did the right thing. The demon is dead; he won&apos;t be able to hurt anyone anymore.*
*Ask how much he&apos;d be willing to pay.*
Your loss.
*The stag nuzzles you, its soft, downy snout pressed into your side.*
All barrels explode!
A new Divine rose, a true heir to the Seven, more powerful than ever, and united Rivellon in its battle against the Void. All across the realm he was loved, worshipped and adored. Humans, lizards, elves and dwarves all rallied to his banner. The great allegiance stood once more, but war raged on.
Everybody in life makes choices. His end is the result of his.
*The crocodile slumps down and closes its eyes.*
Fine, fine. But stay out of trouble, or you&apos;ll regret it.
*Say it was nothing. Nothing at all.*
*Saheila greets Sebille with respect.*
I am Billy. Very nice to meet you. You&apos;re in possession of something I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;keenly &lt;/i&gt;interested in, you see.
Away with ya, reptile.
Vaporise Skillbook
[The book speaks darkly about the risks - and benefits - of taking the Source of living beings. It speaks of condemnation to oblivion, of Source ill-gained... but the words tantalise rather than disgust you. A strange hunger grows inside you - a hunger you never knew till now. And suddenly, you&apos;re perfectly aware that you could satisfy this hunger if you would only speak the spell...]
Candleholder
Increase FreeCamera FoV
Yes, yes, I&apos;m sure you will. Now lay DOWN! You, sir! I&apos;ll thank you not to provoke my patients. And that&apos;s a courtesy I&apos;ll only offer ONCE!
And how would you do that? Ask your queen to snap her fingers and conjure up a new one? Ha. No. Unless a new Divine ascends, it&apos;s over. Forever.
This body is fresh. Were they... a Sourcerer?
*Stand before him in shock. Mutter that he just killed a man in cold blood.*
Your question only fans the flames! The anguish is unbearable. Just when the agony subsides, another pilgrim makes her way to the shrine and puts flame to the torches.
Look. Think twice before you say something like that. I don&apos;t care what some apparition in a shrine says. I&apos;ve got  your back. I hope you have mine too.
Keep your snout clean.
Well, I&apos;m still here, aren&apos;t I? That&apos;s just about the highest compliment I can pay.
It&apos;s... it&apos;s showing me a battle. No - a massacre. Deathfog in the forests!
Accelerating Flight
*Tell him you&apos;re a Sourcerer, escaped from the Fort. All you want is to leave this island, and you don&apos;t want to hurt him.*
What they don&apos;t know can&apos;t hurt them. Don&apos;t tell them.
But wait. There&apos;s an easier way.
You kid me, surely! I do not fall for obvious tricks. Come on, off to prison with you.
Warning
*Beast remains silent, though his clenched jaw reveals his resentment. He moves his hand towards his weapon.*
*Tell the creature that you are here to receive its blessing.*&lt;br&gt;
Kill Roost.
*Tell him he&apos;s lucky you don&apos;t show him what you can do.*
But - that collar must be driving you mad. See Leya in the Sanctuary. If you could offer her some small comfort over Gareth she may feel ready to help you.
You hold your damn tongue!
Most organic matter can be turned to purposes dark or light. Use with caution.
*Mention that she gave you a &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;nice discount for guessing the answer to her riddle.*
If you can douse the fire, kin, sing these words.  The chest will open for you like a cracked egg.
It so warms my heart to see you again.
Thanks, bub. You better believe I will.
*Psst.* Hey. You&apos;re a little light in yer trunk, ain&apos;t ya? Who could blame you with the garbage they&apos;ve got fer sale around here.
Had you partaken in my little questionnaire, I&apos;d have assessed your cooking skills, fashion sense, and regard for personal hygiene. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m stretching any hypothetical truths when I assume I&apos;d have found you lacking in all three departments.
And I thought I was the only reader here.
*Ask the talking cranium if it knows what&apos;s happening on this ship.*
A traumatised warrior is the only one left alive to bear witness.
I miss it, the belief.
*Take your leave.*
I have unlocked a great power within you - one only those like &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;can wield.
The smeared ink in this water-stained tome makes it difficult to decipher every entry.
*And there goes the rest of your bottle...*
Behave yourself, tasty.
Well. Good!
Insults? You should be honoured that I would even talk to you! I am the most powerful Sourcerer to have ever scuttled upon this shore!
Straddling the line of ostentatious and elegant, this waistcoat shows off your finest assets while concealing weapons from view.
*Psst.* Hey. You&apos;re a little light in yer pack, ain&apos;t ya girl? Who could blame you with the garbage they&apos;ve got fer sale around here.
An odd black gem found on the person of Alexandar. Shiny and smooth as a mirror, you can see your reflection distorted in it.
You&apos;re not going any further, dwarf.
*Insist he fulfil his part of the bargain first. He&apos;ll see the tablet &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; he teaches you of Source.*
I understand. But there is so much more to me than my needle.
You... ah yes, I remember your face from Driftwood. The fool that refused to shake my hand.
And Dallis will kill the Voidwoken! BLAM! Like that!
Meat Seeker
Wise.
There is a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;ghost&lt;/font&gt; nearby. Ghosts may linger anywhere they have unfinished business. Cast &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Spirit Vision&lt;/font&gt; regularly to find them.
We rescued a Paladin from execution at the hands of her leader, Lord Linder Kemm.
Jahan offered to improve our mastery of Source powers, by drawing Source from demons. We refused - demons or not, it did not seem like the right thing to do.
Agreed. I&apos;ll keep silent about this if you do.
Prime Scion... Prime Traitor...
Move aside, dwarf - move aside! I need to find my little girl - I need to find my baby!
*As she rises up to her full height, the stench of death and excrement assaults you.*
An aura that adds [1] to weapon skills and attacks for all allies near you.
I think I&apos;m about to have another chat, but in the meantime, my dear, you may fetch me my slippers.
Didn&apos;t always seem right. I watched you back in Fort Joy, &apos;n&apos; felt that pull. But I shook it off. I&apos;m a free man, dammit. Can&apos;t let some beauty get the best of me.
A heavy, worn diary filled with neat writing.
Hold there, lizard! Reach for a weapon and I&apos;ll see you gutted, filleted, and pickled.
Run. Run away. Run from Arx, run from the coast. Just run. Run from the Deathfog...
*Smile. Actually you&apos;re pretty happy you&apos;re not Divine. You have a different life to lead.*
*Give his belly a little rub.*
We found her already caged, you know, cursing the Magisters with hexes vulgar enough to turn even a dwarf&apos;s cheeks red.
*See what else you can get from the spirit. Force it further back in time.*
How very curious. How very curious indeed...
*The elf cautiously watches as you leave before returning to his book, leafing quickly through the pages.*
Blessed Blood
&lt;i&gt;I am me. And only me. The next move is yours. Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him about the war between the Divine Order and the Black Ring. It dwarfed everything that went before.*
