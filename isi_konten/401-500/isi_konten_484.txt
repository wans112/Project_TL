I am feeling... well, if not good, then certainly better. I just needed time to think. My parents led good lives. I&apos;d rather celebrate them for the love they gave me than to wail over their loss.
You&apos;re a mystic too?
*She looks into your eyes.*
Watch yourself, lad.
Tracks of the Tyrant
You have returned here too early, my chosen. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
*Tell him you&apos;re being sincere. Of course you rejoice at his survival!*
Consume for a dose of essential vitamins and poison, or find another use for it.
*Explain that you&apos;ve seen the meat of the will, and you don&apos;t want to ham it up, but the swine didn&apos;t leave him a sausage.*
*Groan* Out my... out my face... them scales won&apos;t... won&apos;t save yeh... I&apos;ll punch yer lights out...
*Call to Beast. What&apos;s he doing?*
Holding the fort, like we always do. Usually the fort in question is bigger than this one, but you do the job in front of you, don&apos;t you? Seems someone high up doesn&apos;t trust the Magisters to do their jobs out there.
Ancient Belt
Mind Maggot Grenade
Brahmos the lizard dreamer revealed that the Red Princess was waiting for the Red Prince.
*Her look of shock quickly transforms into beatific wonder. She reaches out to you, trembling hands making benedictions.*
The Ancestor Tree knows the name of a powerful arch-demon.

Tavern Kitchen
Report back to the Magisters.
Don&apos;t misunderstand me. I&apos;m not a genie from your lizard sagas. But I can expose the &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; that gnaws at your bones.
Step away!
*The enormous, unusually-red troll looms over you with his fists clenched threateningly. His expression is stern, yet you can see the tiniest twinkle in his intelligent eyes.*
*Ifan grabs you by the sleeve. Not hard, but insistent.*
Roost
[SCHOLAR] *Note that you heard that livewood came only from ancestor trees of the elven homeland... but those forests were sacrificed in the wars of the previous generation...*
It&apos;s power-hungry fools like you that have made our actions so necessary. Rivellon needs to be saved from your ilk.
Forest - Deep Forest C
*She draws her weapon and scowls.*
*Claim that Gareth&apos;s dying words were in praise of Exter and his potential - he can lead the Seekers to safety.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll write the tale yourself. And if she&apos;s very nice, you&apos;ll buy her a house on an island once you become rich and famous.*
Allow me to *zzzzssskttt* show you.
Time to sing, Godwoken. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
*Scratch scratch*
All like me have such eyes. With them, I see spirits... not a blessing on this haunted island. You are lucky not to see the desperation that lies before me.
Well, I have you to thank for that, don&apos;t I, chief?
Fancy Chest
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
And I&apos;ll take &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;weapon too, if it&apos;s available. What do you say, can I count on your help?
&apos;Take me, I&apos;m yours.&apos;
[SCHOLAR] *Their evidence doesn&apos;t seem very strong. You wonder if it will stand up in court.*
Come, you small, uninitiated creature. Do you duty and perform this service. Kill me! Kill me, so I may know the truth.
Anyways, I&apos;m not in charge. Tomorrah&apos;s in charge. We all do what she says.
*He squints and tilts his head, then taps his forefinger against his lips before pointing it directly at you.*
*Laugh and assure her you&apos;re an excellent gardener.*
My... my thanks.
Speak with the trader Zaleskar.
He&apos;s not exactly a popular fellow. And that&apos;s putting it lightly. &lt;br&gt;
You don&apos;t find Lohar. Lohar finds you.
Don&apos;t feel bad about your kinsman. He&apos;s better off.
*The fish wished it had been the one that got away.*
Ding, ding ding! My lute calluses are all but worn off. I&apos;m a disgrace!
Bardiche
*A sparkle flashes into her eye. She grinds her hips against yours a fraction of an inch and leans in to whisper in your ear:*
Queen Justinia confronts rebel factions! Dwarven royal stands tall!
*Offer to stomp out whatever life remains to him.*
*This is too much to bear! You could never kill your true love. &lt;i&gt;Attack him outright.*&lt;/i&gt;
My soul. Mine to claim! What remains is yours, yet it is not all that belongs to you. Visit the past to find your future, dwarf.
The Essence of Existence, Volume Three&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is wrong to kill a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is it? What if that man has killed another? Is it wrong then?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If yes, then what if he has killed two others? Or three? How many shall die at his hand before we can put him to death with a clear conscience?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is wrong to steal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is it wrong for a poor man to thieve bread from a rich man who stores loaves in abundance? How empty must the thief&apos;s belly be before we forgive him his crime? How full must the rich man&apos;s granary be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There can never be one law that answers the question of what is right and what is wrong. There is only a river of justice, steered by the impulses of men and women, Gods and Goddesses, chance and nature.
The monolith gave up its treasure.
LEAVE ME! What do you want? Why are you staring at me so? Come for my very SOUL have you?!
I warned ya of this mad traitor, I did, but you tied a collar &apos;round your neck and tossed this Black Ring witch the leash. The precious queen, an agent of the God King - and he barely had t&apos;lift a finger.
God&apos;s teeth, it feels good to move again. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have a house to secure. Meet me at my home in Driftwood. We have much to discuss.
Come to talk about trust some more, Godwoken?
&lt;i&gt;I see you. &lt;/i&gt;And inside you is the strength I&apos;ve been looking for.
Speak with the demon-hunter.
Dead Rat
*Remark that with their witch dead, returning to their true forms may be... problematic.*
*Ask if he fetched anything for you.*
But the half-demonâ€™s secret was taking its toll on her.
If you can find a bucket, sure. Consider it my last offering to a DYING RACE!

I&apos;ll give you whaaaaat you waaaaaant, after you &lt;i&gt;sssssssset ussssssss free.&lt;/i&gt;
One cannot accomplish greatness as a bloated corpse picked apart by shoreline vermin.
Crafting Bible, Part XVII
Student of the Arena, are you?
*The shimmering ghost of a kin Magister turns her gaze upon you. She holds your stare, boring into your skull, searching the hollows of your eyes for the secrets of your soul... but in so doing she shows you hers.*
INTRUDER! INTRUDER!
You &apos;itch. &apos;ut as long as you don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest, you can &apos;e a &apos;itch all you want.
*The man slumbers, a scowl on his face as if something&apos;s wrong. But he doesn&apos;t wake up.*
*Keep your irritation to yourself and bow politely. What&apos;s this heirloom of hers you&apos;ve heard about?*
*He nods and smiles silently -  then pushes away your finger and thrusts his lips against yours. Suddenly, you are at sea, lost in that sumptuous beard, and rocking to the rhythm of the waves. You pull out of the kiss and the vision...*
Obliterator
*He pauses in anticipation, then frowns.*
Mute sound when game window is not focused
*Tell him the Doctor is dead.*
Helmet visual is always visible.
Undead? For now, little gnat. But not forever. A promise has been made.
Walnut Cream
*HISS!* I already died once - I&apos;m not afraid to die again. Now away with you!
*Squee snorkle!*
Tha&apos;s right, stretch. We&apos;re taking all your stuff. Any quarrel with that, you can take it up with Lohar.
Nothing like a nice tentacle slap across the maw to set the tone for the week, eh? How&apos;d you escape?
Bridge
*Hold your tongue about the ring you found, then wish him good luck and walk away.*
*Tell her to make it quick.*
You don&apos;t bother your pretty little head about it, and I&apos;ll bid you a good day.
We gave Almira the Swornbreaker. She&apos;ll free herself of the God King&apos;s covenant. She promised to help us when the time comes.
Uh... I don&apos;t suppose I could have that sword back, could I?
Call from the Depths
I keep seeing imaginary Voidwoken around every corner. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll ever feel safe in these streets again.
Let&apos;s stick together until we get there. Then... we&apos;ll see.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;There&apos;s danger within the storm - but even greater danger in remaining ashore.&apos; &lt;/i&gt;I have faith. In Lucian, and in you.
Mmmm, who are you, you lovely little puppy?
[SCHOLAR]*Say you outwit the door, and you&apos;ll outwit him in combat too.*
I mean to take it back.
*Steer the conversation in another direction.*
Helmet
The great and honourable Dallis will hear of this. She will know where the serpent slithers, and crush it under her heel!
*He&apos;s breaking too soon to your liking. Slide your nail across one of his eyes. Deeply.*
Am I safe even in dreams? Surely the Void cannot reach me here...
Matters more urgent than the honour of the imperial houses? Bah! Your inferiority knows no bounds.
SMAA 1x
Let&apos;s.
Caomail s&apos;aravel, damerail s&apos;aravel! Mashetou! Sh&apos;danilou!
The houses of War and of Shadows were particularly useful in the fight against the God King.
Ha! Fair enough, I&apos;ll do just that. Go on through, and see if I care what happens to you.
And yet, here you stand. Small, weak - decaying. I will not even need the Aeteran to grind you into the dust.
You will be forgiven, son. If not by me, than by mercy of th&apos; Divine to come.
Well. Alright then. But do me a favour and keep your nose clean.
We&apos;ve acquired the Boots of Contamination.
After all that we&apos;ve been through since Fort Joy? After all &lt;i&gt;that,&lt;/i&gt; to end up with Lucian once more? To settle for abject corruption over change?
*...and a gentle pain stabs your heart. Lucian smiles at you and then is gone, and you worry so for Raedalus.*
It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; worth it, wasn&apos;t it? Now, baby, you should leave.
You do...? That&apos;s supposed to be a bloody secret! So much for keeping it well-hidden...
True. I&apos;m in deep, deep -
*Refuse.*
I should know better than to remove a dragon egg from its fire.
*So the Seven are the ones responsible for this. They banished the God King and started this mess. Are you &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;you&apos;re following the right Gods?*
Red skin? Are... are you sure you didn&apos;t do anything funny with a wig and a mirror? I know no red-skinned lizard but your honoured self!
I wouldn&apos;t be much of a Seeker if I didn&apos;t recognise a Sourcerer, especially one still wearing their collar...
Available Skills
Very well. But my eyes watch you still.
*Say this is odd talk, considering the setting.*
I cannot say I&apos;m much enthused, but what can I do?
*Remark that it&apos;s a bit cold in here, clothes are probably a good idea.*
Last I saw &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;, she was packing her finery onto a ship. Rhalic knows where she&apos;s washed up, but I&apos;m glad to be free of her nagging for a while.
It haunted me for days, that bell. But lately it seems to have... stopped.
This humble pendant fits comfortably in your hand. It may not look like much, but it gives you a sense of having found something you&apos;d lost.

Remove poison surfaces and clouds. Gain poison damage bonus to weapon attacks and weapon-based skills (dependent upon size of poison area cleared).
Well, far be it from me to stand in your way. Big Tomorrah and the Thieves&apos; Guild are down in the sewers, below Arx. Don&apos;t ask me how to get down there, &apos;cause I don&apos;t know.
Arx is... a dimmer jewel without Lord Arhu, I must admit...
