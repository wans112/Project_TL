We mustn&apos;t forget the House of Shadows continues to hunt us. The Dreamer I met only managed to elude them by escaping bodily into the dream realm, never to return.
Don&apos;t embarrass yourself. Only imbeciles insult what they cannot understand.
Can I indeed? How very gratifying.
Son of a...
Served Lucian myself.
Happy to trundle around with a group of amateurs at your heels, are you? Or naught but your own skinny shadow?
*The spirit falls silent for a moment, to compose himself.*
I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re too late. I&apos;ve collected all there is to find - quite enough, too! Braccus Rex certainly had a knack for body-making, didn&apos;t he.
Well now, wouldn&apos;t that be grand! Fresh grass every summer, maize all winter, and - why&apos;re you lookin&apos; at me like that?
Bird &amp; Wind Forest 02
*The warg does not release your arm.*
You watch yourself. The Voidwoken around here are winged hell.
*He leans in closer, and sniffs the air once more.*
Gravekeeper Farimah is dead.
Ah, Godwoken. You know how you relive bad exams in your nightmares?
Only Sebille could bring the elves together once more.
*You&apos;re curious - ask what business he has with Malady.*
*Say that Alexandar is dead - he perished before he could even make it into the Council of Seven.*
There are those who believe that little legend, you know. I&apos;m not one of them.
*Laugh. You are an Eternal. You cannot be defeated by some mad witch.*
We found a kill-list of Magisters on the tavern cook.

A rare rose that grows only in killing fields. The crimson petals smell like putrescent flesh and filthy outhouses.
A hydrated adventurer is a happy adventurer.
Seekers - we move. You are Lucian&apos;s eyes and ears. You are his sword and his shield. Burn the blackness with your holy fire!
Smuggler&apos;s Letter
([1] AP)
*The creature&apos;s whine turns to a roar. The room reverberates as it shouts forth its own name.*
*He smiles, but clearly it&apos;s costing him quite a bit of effort.*
*Growl that you don&apos;t care what she thinks - she had best let you pass...*
A simple canvas pouch used for holding small trinkets, coins, or herbs.
An eternity of pain and suffering is mine,
Rainwater Amulet
This Scion, the one we seek now...
*Take your leave.*
I can&apos;t do it again.
*Gareth nods, then continues speaking with Malady - though more quietly than before.*
Hrrrm... mating season, you know. All the young &apos;uns are hopping after each other double-quick.
I&apos;ve learned this skill already.
*Declare that you&apos;re looking for Dallis - has she seen her?*
*Noticing your movement, he shakes his head and the mask of hatred disappears. He smiles again, even wider than before, yet his eyes stay hollow.*
[HERO] *Tell her there&apos;s no place in a civilised world for a device like this.*
It is mercifully quiet now. Quiet enough for me to make my final plea: &lt;i&gt;Yield to me.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you hope this will be better. In a world where everyone is frightening, no-one is.*
Tension: High&lt;br&gt;Everyone&apos;s a suspect. Prepare to be investigated.
Magical Hammered Scale Gloves
Indeed - you can pass through the fog unscathed. As for the creature you will find on the other side...
I&apos;m not going anywhere.
I must ascend. It is the only way to guarantee that my race will never be snuffed out.
Find the hideout.
Glowing Idol of Rebirth
Arrow Or Shaft
*Ask what happened to him.*
*As your fingertips brush the cool stone, you feel the depths of your being crack open. Your power flows from you into the relic, yet a reverse current flows back into you with a new power. A &lt;i&gt;different &lt;/i&gt;power.*
*As you kiss, you can feel one of her hands grabbing you by the back of the neck as the other slides down in between your legs.*
Chastising Memo
Alright, Ancient One. But Magister Atusa is overdue. She promises to come at noon. We are afraid to stay, afraid to leave...
You believe this, Kana? She&apos;s pushin&apos; me, ain&apos;t she? Right to the edge.
Bride&apos;s Bane
By all means, fast if you must, but your hunger will soon trump your all too delicate feelings.

You&apos;d go in there? Zorl-Stissa bless you! Please, save what you can... &lt;i&gt;who &lt;/i&gt;you can!
Farewell to flesh. Farewell to bone. Farewell...
The Black Ring swear allegiance to a powerful being, the God King. This is not a mere oath of duty - this is the Covenant, and those who accept it are bound to the God King. They are Sworn. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am Sworn.
Combat Abilities
Same story here.
The Whites have a secret vault beneath the Magister barracks, accessed from a store-room. Could Dallis be hiding there?
Someone else, that&apos;s what. Can&apos;t say for sure what, but I&apos;d give &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;one a wide berth, if I were you.
Sadha, my sweet, our meeting has been shrouded in mystery, but know that I&apos;ll do right by you. Know that I love you!
You can&apos;t escape the reality of your existence!
But I was wrong.
*Before you go on, ask who the prisoners in the cellar are, and why there are here.*
*Take your leave.*
We were able to craft a complete set of the Vultureâ€™s armour.
*You are a Sourcerer, fleeing the Magisters in Driftwood. Hungry, you come upon a pair of honeybears. The bears do not attack, so you try to steal their honey. And - *OUCH* - you are stung to death by bees.*
We dug up a treasure chest that was buried on a high north-eastern cliff.
It feels...
Jahan was imprisoned in the Doctor&apos;s cellar.
You&apos;ve seen this troll before? It... it can&apos;t be all that dangerous, can it? Maybe I should just, you know... go over there and talk to it...
*His eyebrow creeps upwards and he tilts his head, staring at you so intently that it&apos;s almost like he can &lt;i&gt;see through your mask&lt;/i&gt;...*
We can hope they haven&apos;t figured out &lt;i&gt;we&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; Godwoken.
*Unpleasant giggling emerges from under the reaver&apos;s helm as he toys with the heart.*
Guards ahead. They don&apos;t look friendly.
*She laughs merrily as you kiss your way down until your lips arrive in between her legs. A long time passes as you mellowly build up a steady rhythm and she climaxes with what always seems to be that final, blissful breath.*
I am the only one who cares. &lt;i&gt;She &lt;/i&gt;will say otherwise - she always does. And in the end, she&apos;ll betray you.

Sarias is a warrior, good and true, but he is not yet lost. May his tree take root and grow. This is no well of souls, it is but a hastily dug pit. We stand ritual in this moment more in hope than faith.
[Translate104_d19dbfca-0af2-4b2f-a800-bb4f89efe62a]
But I have chosen you to lead lizard-kind out of the darkness. To usher in a &lt;i&gt;new &lt;/i&gt;era for our proud people.
*You locate a key hidden behind the frame, and slip it into your pack.*
*The being lurches forward once more. Mid-stride he catches himself and transforms the movement into a servile bow.*
Alexandar is dead. We should not forget to take his head.
You better get a handle on yourself. Because you will not be able to handle me.
*Sebille twirls her needle, her face set in a defiant scowl.*
Donna&apos;s Supper Wine 1485
*Snap that maybe she should do something to help, then.*
*It summons the energy to snap at you, thrashing in the sand. You jump back.*
*You regret to say that&apos;s a little too rich for your blood at the moment.*
*Wonder why the shrine is here. These swamps don&apos;t seem like a good place to worship.*
What&apos;re you smiling about?
*The melody is similar to a popular dwarven drinking song, though the modern version is markedly less macabre.*
Gareth&apos;s back... too late for the wounded... not one of them lived to see him return...
*Raise an eyebrow. He wants you to commit murder, after all that&apos;s happened here?*
*&apos;The Lone Wolves take my daughter. Our Scion. She cannot be lost. &lt;i&gt;Find her.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Investigate the elven structure.

Clear &apos;em out? Are you mad?
*Frown and say you&apos;re used to him being more defiant than that!*
Ha! As it happens that invitation is why I let you live.
*Grunt.*
So too might you appreciate the blackest of roses. Look deep in the earth to the southeast, where the revolting seeds the rapturous.
*Draw your weapon. Now he can die out in the fresh air...*

You look like a resourceful type though - if you can find or make something to use as a shovel, then this might be your ticket to freedom.
Song Of Nature
Bock?!
*Tell him that you know he married the bride for her money - not love.*
*The eyes, stone grey, turn pale green. They mesmerise, then enchain, then lure you in...*
But &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;may have a chance.

Mother. You don&apos;t look well. And how vulnerable you are... at heart.
*The Magister moves away to inspect a nearby pile of fish, but you can feel his eyes on you as you flex your claws.*
Can&apos;t offer what you don&apos;t have, ben-Mezd.
We lose &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. We cannot lose more.
*Tell him the Path of Blood is history. The tomb has been breached, and not by pilgrims, but by &lt;i&gt;thieves.&lt;/i&gt; Only you can stop them.*
Well, what can I say?
A giant rock filled with sticky oil that deals [1]. Creates an oil surface where it lands.
I hatched the egg and the dragon within - my child - was born. The dragonkin have returned to Rivellon.
I don&apos;t cavort in blackness, my lovely girl. I know only meadows and gardens.
On your way, elf.
Will you sink or float?
I tried to run. They were everywhere. &lt;i&gt;Everywhere!&lt;/i&gt;
Dallis and Vredeman have called the Magisters to assemble at the barracks in Arx. Our search should begin there.

House Exterior - River Cottage
What do you say, &lt;i&gt;rav&lt;/i&gt;?
Many have laid claim to Lucian&apos;s legacy, including his own inferior spawn. I presume our visitor has more than a vague title to boast of?
*Roar at him. &lt;i&gt;He. Will. Talk.*&lt;/i&gt;
Ivory
Sooner you tell me what you want to buy, sooner I can get back to doing what I like best: &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;. So?
*As you take in the bizarre architecture all around you, standing a little way off, you see Fane. Not a skeleton. Not a mask. Not some shadowy figure. You see Fane.*
*You expect anger. Instead, Gareth smiles - a thin, frightening smile.*
*You have a nagging suspicion. Tell him to explain those last words.*
*Hand over the leg.*
*Answer that you are no slaver - you wish for the ship to be free, and hope that it will help you in return.*
Maybe it was just the lack o&apos; food and rest playing tricks, but I swear I heard chanting and... horrible moaning coming from here. But when we broke free, it was empty...
Yet the Queen ushers in a golden age...
*Nod, and repeat that Braccus Rex was vanquished long ago.*
The Lady Vengeance
What. Do I have something on my face?
And you, Lohse Divine. What did you do with your power? What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
*Do as she asks and give your hands, palms up.*
Lucian
You speak to her. You understand. You see what a gentle soul she is. You see how kind.
Water sloshes inside...
*Actually, you&apos;re suddenly not so sure about this. What happens if you don&apos;t want to risk it?*
