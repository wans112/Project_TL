[LIZARD] *You spot a mark on the figurehead - it&apos;s a living scar, the same type used to subdue elves back home in the Empire.*
That little cat never had a chance. Do any of us here?
*The elf gives you a cool look. When he speaks it&apos;s through gritted teeth.*
Queen Justinia&apos;s attack on Arx was intended to defend her people from the Divine Order.
*The object of his hate - the spirit of his captain, standing before him.*
Wonderful. Come, let&apos;s retire to that satin nest of mine. Follow me.
Oh... ugh.
Oh, for... give her the Swornbreaker! You can&apos;t let her stay in thrall to the God King!
Cadaver
I can&apos;t see you die, old friend.
Later, darling. Consider me not making you my pet my thanks.
Dwarves, elves, lizards, and humans, all became slaves, ruled over by the Sworn and the Eternals. The God King had defeated the Seven and returned from the Void.
No problem - that&apos;s already my specialty. Like I &lt;i&gt;said&lt;/i&gt;, ya nugget. Anyway...
You can wait and watch over there. Or leave. I care not which.
You should have listened to Tarquin, you worm-ridden wench. Nobody enslaves Braccus Rex!
*Back away a little.*
Pure
Here, did I ever tell you of the time I cursed that court eun-
Forest - Crossing Paths B
[NOBLE] *Say that you, for one, have a great respect for everyone of ability, no matter their breeding.*
The Voidwoken come...
*Place a hand on his shoulder. His are the first gentle words you&apos;ve heard in some time.*
Oh, please. I know when I&apos;m being tricked.
Remember this lesson when you leave Bloodmoon Island. The demon blackens another land now. It possesses the very doctor that liberated it.
Sickle
Voidwoken
I suppose I was given a blessing, but I have my doubts...
*Tell her you don&apos;t believe in any of that mystical nonsense.*
Your end will be our beginning!
Oil
Oh, for goodness&apos; sake, woman: lower your spear. That is no way to greet a guest.
Deal?
No matter what is asked of you, you &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;learn from them.
No telling if there are more ashore. And I doubt that... that voice will save any of us again.
Next
Elder of Passing
Of course I am, or I wouldn&apos;t be here. But I am humble enough to know that if Rivellon is to survive, I must surrender my power to the Divine Order.
Heavy Hands
A very reasonable concern, I&apos;m afraid.
Return to Gareth.
Pinpoint
Can&apos;t say why. I&apos;m as gentle as can be! But such is the way of it. Alas, I am stuck sniffing out herbs and fungi on the periphery.
*He pockets the gold piece and starts his pitch to the public once more.*
This creature - this monster - would have seen us drowned at sea. Kill her.
What happened? I just remember -... Oh no. No that can&apos;t be right.
*Tell her to stay here and lay low. You&apos;ll take care of them.*
*Say you&apos;ll do what you can to bring Gareth back. Maybe he&apos;ll have what they need.*
*Announce that the tinkerer, the one suspected in these Magister disappearances, is dead.*
*The vines weave together into a piece of armour.*
Lies, lies, and more lies! Now face your death!
&lt;i&gt;Monster!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ve seen some undead in my time, but never one with a skull like yours. I don&apos;t think you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;like me, brother.
*You&apos;ve heard that the leader of the Divine Order is here. Is that who he means?*
*Ask what he knows about these disappearances.*
Something&apos;s breaking through!
Blessings be. I haven&apos;t seen anything like this since the Deathfog struck...
Party Invitation
*Ask him what the hells is going on here.*
[ELF] *Change your mind. You&apos;ll tear the secrets from his sallow sinews. Send the Sallow Man to his maker.*
Their betrayal of Lucian and all that he stood for is monumental.
*Assent. Why not?*
*The spirit burns with rage at the carnage wrought on Arx - rage for the Voidwoken, rage for the Magisters... and rage too for himself and his fellow Paladins for failing to see the danger until it was too late.*
*Hold her close. Chant quietly, &apos;Come back, come back&apos;.*
I can&apos;t see anything beneath that trash.
Deepest apologies, but that is not my truth to reveal.
Are ya daft? &apos;course they&apos;ll come for us. Lohar&apos;s ain&apos;t gonna just twiddle his toes forever.
*Spit back.*
The whole Kingdom could have been lost to the Voidwoken, there and then.
*Your body convulses with Duna&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile grows at the sight of your agony.*
*She pauses and considers, then rises from her bow.*
I hear of no escapes. The only way out is through. Through the Magisters, through their cure. Thugs I can stand. But I fear the Magisters.
*Sniff.* Collar. On. Source. Gone. GO!
Lovely!
Bella the Scoop
I went to a strange place. I met... a figure. I don&apos;t know who it was. The figure gave me... a blessing.
*Ask what Stonegarden is.*
Demonic Flayer Blaster
Are those... the gods? What&apos;s wrong with them?
Because I should have pushed in the needle when I had you in my grip.
These &apos;Purging Wands&apos; seem to be key to our escape - we have to find some, then return to Exter
Be still, my wretched, wretched heart! The Mistress of Song is &lt;i&gt;here!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him he&apos;s in no position to question you - you are who you say you are. That&apos;s all there is to it.*
You are favoured by the Doctor, sweetbread. I will try to restrain myself.
We agreed to help Sadha. She&apos;ll stay safe here.
I know what you look like! I&apos;ll report you! Queen Justinia will have vengeance...
They pursue you. You must run.
Now close your eyes, and do as I do.
Mage Sandals
*Beryl searches her memories for comfort; she finds one, and her worried brows relax for just a moment. The moment is brief, though, and doubts soon cloud her face once more.*
Griff&apos;s Leather Shirt
Perhaps. But just this once, let&apos;s worry about that another day. Today is a day of triumph!
Thankee, your wisefulness! I admit it ain&apos;t my best, but I figgered you&apos;d tired of hearin&apos; the usual shanties. Though I know them ones, too. No shortage of Beast ballads out there.
I don&apos;t have enough money for this!
*Tell her you&apos;re not its cousin.*
Grrrrrrrrr! &lt;i&gt;GRRRRRRR!&lt;/i&gt;
Sure. As powerful as anyone else, seems to me. My blade doesn&apos;t discriminate. It cuts a woman&apos;s throat just as cleanly as any man&apos;s.
Hmm... good. &lt;i&gt;Very &lt;/i&gt;good. Normally I would test my pupils&apos; acumen here, but I can sense that yours is well-developed. An educator&apos;s intuition, let&apos;s say.
They took care of the Voidwoken, right? Give it time. They&apos;ve got a lot to deal with.
*Say you&apos;ve no other reason than natural curiosity.*
*Bathed in the half light of these starless barrens, you spot a figure you could only describe as... a second self.*
*You walk away, find a nice spot in the shade and close your eyes. When you wake from your nap you see Sadha and the Red Prince exiting the wagon, hand in hand.*
And still too short a lifetime. And still too soft a passion, longing for what might have been.
Exit Sneak Mode
*Say you understand, if &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; understands you may have to face each other as enemies.*
*Tell him not to worry. You&apos;ve been through worse together by now.*
&lt;i&gt;Get the hells away from me!&lt;/i&gt;
Settle an argument for us?
I like an elf who knows what he wants and isn&apos;t afraid to take it. You&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. But let&apos;s take it slow. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
Death stops everyone eventually. You rose from the dead once. You won&apos;t rise &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time.
Action Points preserved
Lord Arhu? Surely you&apos;ve heard of him. Rummage around in your childhood memories, pick a legend, and you&apos;ll find a scrap of a tale involving one of his feats.
Metamorph
Ornate Dagger
But anyway, don&apos;t you worry, darling: your secret&apos;s safe with me.
*Ask him if he&apos;s going to be okay with Sebille now that she murdered Stingtail.*
Possessed Dwarf
Rat
Why would Lord Kemm have a Black Ring mirror in his attic?
Most excellent. This is a visage I can get on board with. Let me feel your lips on mine.
Don&apos;t be a stranger, now.
*Ask if she&apos;s ever seen this kind of magic before. It seems as though her father has suffered some kind of strange treatment.*
*Laugh and tell him one of the guards on the upper deck fell overboard. He should check it out!*
Forest - Deep Forest A
*Ask to hear the ode he composed for Kemm.*
*Offer him a Void-tainted fish.*
Strange Panel
Spirit of Magister Telyn
*Ask for a bowl of stew. Not that you&apos;re that hungry...*
*Wait for the queen&apos;s response. The situation could resolve itself.*
I need worship only one Divine. And I believe she stands before me now.
He&apos;s been a brother to her ever since. She even made a gift of the collar - turned it into a necklace for him to wear. Funny sense of humour she has.
Amadia
Exploration Theme 04 Ud
*Shake your head - if Gareth&apos;s returned, it&apos;s nothing to do with you.*
By Seven&apos;s grace, may I be greeted by loved ones lost...
Table
Then there was the Queen. Smart as a whip, that one, and just as likely to sting you.
*With obvious distaste, Fane pulls Atusa&apos;s gore-streaked leg from his backpack and hands it to the Magister.*
Mountain - Waterfall
Easy, gecko, or I&apos;ll root you to the ground and call a Voidwoken to show you the true meaning of terror. Muah-hah!
Gods rest your poor, dear liver.
*Say you want to know exactly what the Magisters&apos; &apos;cure&apos; for Sourcerers entails.*
I think it&apos;s fair to say that I have no advice for you - &lt;i&gt;none whatsoever.&lt;/i&gt; Please, do enjoy fending for yourself against my former comrades.
I&apos;d wish you good luck, but I&apos;ve a feeling you&apos;re the one who won&apos;t need it.
But this is the best time of all. You, just dancing a contract into my lap. What else are friends for?
Dearest heart, you cannot tell me you look about this world and see an &lt;i&gt;Eternal &lt;/i&gt;realm? It is far too crude.
Eternally, the servants toil and sweat...
Scene
*Tell her to explain just who the God King is.*
NEW ROLL
You can&apos;t mean that... these are our friends and our family you&apos;re talking about. You must want them to survive...
Believe whatever you want, if it makes you happy.
Even one saved is a blessing, in this place of death.
*Raise your eyebrows: &lt;i&gt;&apos;You want me to walk into the den of professional assassins who have a contract to kill me? No thanks&lt;/i&gt;.&apos;*
&lt;i&gt;...run...&lt;/i&gt;
Hah. And what is it you &lt;i&gt;think &lt;/i&gt;you saw?
opened a portal, and left Rivellon forever.
My friend here has taste! Care to trade, friend?
This key looks old and rusty. It may have one use left in it.
*Magister Viktar looks at you suspiciously, then scrawls something illegible down in a tiny notebook. He scowls at you as he stows the notebook back in his voluminous robes.*
Well, as a Lone Wolf with a standing contract to kill Godwoken... I trust you.
So the Sallow Man sends Almira&apos;s swine to gut the Pig Divine. That be right.
Splendid Blade
Scourge of the Seas
Aye, the coin&apos;s sweet, but the smell sure ain&apos;t. Mind you, the boss found a buyer for this lot, so my knife stays sharp and my pockets stay full.
*Say you miss your parents too.*
*Ask what has him so on edge.*
Relax.
Click on townsfolk while in sneak mode to rifle through their pockets.
*The cook appears unmoved by your overtures.*
It&apos;s an ambush. Of course it is.
