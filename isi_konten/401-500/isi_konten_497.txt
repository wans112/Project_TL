It&apos;s a damn miracle that she survived.
I stand by my word - no true Godwoken could abide the will of the God King!
I&apos;m starting to dislike you.
My painting! Some bloody thief stole my painting!
Yes, that&apos;s what we&apos;ll do. The troll will fix it. And then you&apos;ll be dead.
[JESTER] *Ask if you can get a &apos;fair lady&apos; discount.*
Time is money and so is mortar. I&apos;m working here.
Well! That time you slipped on Voidwoken ichor and ended up covered in it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; pretty special...
We helped the dog.
Might do.
*Your own look of horror is met by Justinia&apos;s confident stare. Isbeil&apos;s smirk is no longer subtle, but twists her face into a preposterous knot.*
Captain Sech Zapor
Magical Leather Slacks
&lt;i&gt;Do I know you?&lt;/i&gt;
*Electrical sensations sizzle in your mind. You understand that the runes are ancient Rivellonian, the oldest known language. You feel the fragments under your fingers: &lt;i&gt;&apos;An. An lezrou&lt;/i&gt;.&apos;*
Oh ho! Ya almost got me there! I almost thought you&apos;d really done it. Clever. Appreciate that. Tell ya what - I&apos;m gonna show ya where the Thieves&apos; Guild is. You&apos;ll get under their skin in no time, I bet.
Portrait of Loënne
*He rises up to his full height, peering down at you intently through his icy eyes.*
*Tell the dog it&apos;s when you go to sleep and you don&apos;t wake up - ever.*
Not now.
*The dwarven woman hums to herself as she works with total focus and concentration. Her ears twitch at your approach, but she does not turn to you.*
*Demand he tell you what&apos;s going on here.*
Equipment Panel
Well, you&apos;ve come up clean. Thanks for your patience.
*The depth of unamused ennui staring back at you from those ovine eyes is startling.*
*Smirk. He&apos;s quite a ruthless editor.*
Move Camera Right
Pardon me for being forward but... might I embrace you, just for a moment? I could use a little friendly comfort. Just a little.
Beast opposed me in the battle for Divinity.
*Cry out. You followed the Sallow Man&apos;s orders. The God King will see her punished for this!*
Soon, Isbeil makes her move. With or without us, the God King rises, Godwoken. And he &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; hold you to your promise.
*A sudden shuffle behind you, and Lohse&apos;s mouth is close to your ear.*
Small Poison Resistance Potion
Ashes and bone litter the island, but where death comes, life rises.
An island of Sourcerers. Maybe one of them can help me with my crowded brain.
So the tales ain&apos;t so tall, eh? Shame to see ya cooped up here with us. Still - better collared than noosed, I say. Long as we can get this ale down our throats, all&apos;s good.
*The woman does her best to to help the remaining wounded. She studiously avoids looking at the dead...*
Captain Sech Zapor, the Source King&apos;s Slaver. And you are...?
[RED PRINCE] *Say it can&apos;t be. She&apos;s afraid? The goddess who blessed you?*
*Prays...* I pledge my life to you, O Lucian. Please return.
*Respond. &lt;i&gt;Enthusiastically.*&lt;/i&gt;
Easy enough to say, innit. But between the Voidwoken and the Order, we&apos;ve got ourselves one hell of an orgy to un-screw. Bound to be a mess, ain&apos;t there.
*Stand by Lohse. You didn&apos;t start this mess, but you&apos;ll help her finish it.*
I tried to move away, but it was too late. She was upon me. She had done it: she had outmanoeuvred the Red Prince. Finally, I was vanquished.
Step away from the prisoner, reptile!
Minor Strength Potion
I am not skilled enough to identify [1].
*You feel like a kid again, here on the ground, her devilish eyes twinkling. You&apos;re nervous, suddenly, and can&apos;t think of what to say.*
Combine
Grease your heels with this potion to slither and slide around all foes.
So fret not, but revel in the promise of the lake! I will lead you there when you are ready: when you have become a true Master of the Source, and speak the language of creation itself.
Alas, I fear for them. Now that Gareth has returned, they seem determined to take up arms again. I&apos;ve never known people so keen to rush to their doom.
Safe home to you, now.
So you&apos;re an undead then. How very interesting. One can&apos;t but wonder what memories haunt the hollows of your windswept head...
&lt;i&gt;Precisely.&lt;/i&gt;
*His skull twists into a mask of rage as you raise your weapon.*
REPORT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;29 Sembten&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Our military capabilities are improving&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Silent Monks prove effective foot-soldiers – obedient to the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- They are sometimes prone to bouts of listlessness and melancholia, curable by a shot of Source. Keep ‘em hungry, keep ‘em stable.
Can&apos;t cast, attack, or interact with objects.
Ornate Dwarven Axe
Level [1]: +[2]% Physical Armour.
Speaking of which, allow me to share some wisdom of my own.
Many fragments wash up upon these shores. Tell me what you need.
*Demand to know whose memories those were.*
Liberators
&lt;i&gt;Disturbed.&lt;/i&gt;
Medusa Abomination
Invalid address
Ambience
Look away from the past and into the future, Beast. There is so much work left to do.
Atusa
*Tell her you&apos;re not interested in whatever she&apos;s selling.*
Connecting to game failed
Shut yer trap, kid. Children and dwarves first, just like the ol&apos; stories say!
Well how about that - the Groom managed to trap an elemental ooze within this wand!
*Mmmm*
Mmmm, who are you, who are you, you pretty little salamander?
*Sebille looks at the flask with surprise, but accepts it with a nod and takes a long draught.*
*Offer a quiet bribe.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Demand that he tell you how to navigate past the Path of Blood.*
We hear you. We feel you. Come closer...
Ah! Finally - some *ungh* respite from the day&apos;s horrors. I thank you, indeed I do. Now please... &lt;i&gt;leave me be&lt;/i&gt;.
Ripped-Off Elven Face
*Slink away. This could take a while.*
Welcome, my dear prince, I&apos;m so glad you could come. You seem to have traversed the Deathfog just fine. So tell me, what ails you?
Think on it, because that is what we&apos;re fighting for. To be a god - knowing what a god really is.
*You stand high on a black cliff housing Zorl-Stissa&apos;s temple. Other lizards scream, declaring you a blasphemer.*
The greatest of all Dreamers was waiting for you here, my prince, but... but...
Then again, why not. I suppose some stories were always meant to be told.
Beast is looking for Lohar and the truth about the dwarf queen&apos;s plans.
*Leave him be.*
*Sidestep his blow.*
Find the Lone Wolves.
*Shrug. Humans are no better or worse than any other race - they&apos;re prone to hatred and in-fighting, but they can come together when it&apos;s most important.*
Oh you simply wait until the creature is dead. Preferably of natural causes.
I thought you said you had bad news?! Stop toying with me!
&lt;i&gt;*No!&lt;/i&gt; Kinnet&apos;s tears fall from your eyes as you recognise his beloved weaponmaster, lifeless.*
Does not break Invisibility or sneaking.
*Tell him there&apos;s no accounting for the barbarity of religious folks.*
I don&apos;t blame you - it&apos;s not often that you get to meet a world-class artistic mind... and not my dolt of a son...
*With a flourish, he picks the sword back up and spins it towards you, hilt-first. It&apos;s a simple weapon, well-made and well-maintained. It&apos;s clean, but it feels... tainted.*
An empire built upon the backs of slaves...
Speaking of which I&apos;ve learned a great deal from observing you! I owe you a great debt!
Persuasion Failure! Success impossible.
After the King refused to let me investigate the Veil, I brought the issue up with others.
Now let&apos;s go!
*You stare down at the pile of cracked and broken bones. So much for having &lt;i&gt;him &lt;/i&gt;teach you to channel more Source...*
Vrogir of the Orcs. The bloodthirsty degenerate.
*Say you&apos;re interested in someone with a little finesse. Ask if he&apos;s comfortable in the dextrous arts.*
In its inactive state, the collar appears to be nothing more than common metal. It can no longer hinder Source.
*Inquire after Lucian&apos;s Day and his reasons for attending.*
I&apos;m sure the Godwoken will be able to get the ship moving. Their kind like to feel useful, don&apos;t they?
No! No. Don&apos;t try anything - do you hear?
*Tell him not to get any big ideas about the kind of power he&apos;ll have. You&apos;ll be watching him every step of the way.*
*Ask him what the Magisters wanted with him.*
Crude and cultured, both at once.
I&apos;ve made &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;mistake before. And we all know how well it turned out...
*She sighs deeply, as irritated as if you just threw a spider into her ale.*
Spirit of Higba
*Draw your weapon and tell Marg that Grog sends his regards.*
*She pauses, looks over her shoulder and sees the others hanging from the tree, all but lifeless, for the first time.*
Power! Hmm, an old ambition. I have a token for you who seeks power. A gift.
The Doctor offered a pact. He&apos;ll help defeat Dallis if we&apos;ll share Divinity.
And may my crew forgive me for my sins...
*She barks a laugh in your face.*
But it&apos;s no matter now, we&apos;ll send you to the Hall of Echoes and you can tell &apos;em yourselves.
*Tell him to never mind - you misspoke.*
Arx remained the centre of power as the races united behind the Divine. But it also became the focus of the demons&apos; attacks. Arx would see many more long years of war.
I am relieved you have seen the wisdom of this cause. But pray, a moment.
Blood-wrought Dagger
*The dwarf rocks on her haunches, gnawing at her own bloody knuckles.*
Child&apos;s Shirt
*Her heartbeat returns to normal, and she gives you a look filled at once with menace and with lust; a look that says you cannot touch her heart.*
Remove Gear
That&apos;s what I aim to do. Truly.
Your friends fought for you! Died for you!
*Windego&apos;s eyes clear and she turns her head to the heavens once more.*
Exotic Bow
You saw what I could not. It seems Malady is quite right about you.
*He lifts an invisible cap and bows with the grace of a courtier.*
*Say you&apos;ve seen it before. The elf had touched a spore, sprouted vines?*
*Tell him you&apos;d rather see him reduced to a pile of gore in the middle of the floor.*
*Say that he&apos;s right - Higba is no longer an issue, but the disappearances continue anyway.*
Godwoken. Whatever burden you bear for your actions - my burden is lifted.
Void Devourer
*Ask what a Seeker is.*
That&apos;s what I&apos;m intent on finding out. This tavern is full of scum and degenerates - the true culprit could easily conceal themselves amongst them.
*Shrug. You never liked the clod anyway.*
*Smile. You knew what you were doing.*
What can I say. Guess I... lost control for a minute.
*Contemplate her words. You very much like the sound of this...*
Spirit of Sanguinia Tell
Poison Ooze
Overhead
*The Dreamer then chews and swallows a handful of drudanae leaves before slipping into a trance-like state.*
*Tell her you do indeed feel different. More powerful, yes - and more solemn, too.*
*Shake your head. Ghonghi was wrong to resist.*
*He  drops to his knees before you and grabs onto your feet with both hands, head hanging.*
Change into the form of a dragon, switching racial talents, skills and tags.
(end)
*Magicockerel? Remind yourself to find out more about that later.*
You seek to take. You seek to &lt;i&gt;steal&lt;/i&gt;. You -
&lt;i&gt;Sebille, this needle was forged in an altogether different world. It wasn&apos;t wrought upon a crude anvil, hammered into shape with rough blows. No, it was cast with demon precision. It is absolutely priceless, and it&apos;s yours.&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;Bloodmoon Island&apos;
