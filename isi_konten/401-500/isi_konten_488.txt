An excellent point, well made. The answer to your question is, unsurprisingly, a man in a house. A man in a house buys all the Void-tainted fish I can send him.
Hilde doesn&apos;t think this breastplate comes in handy in a prison, so she&apos;s selling it.
*Tell her you did what you thought would be best for the realm.*
Well, isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; rich? Cursed by a coffin and rescued by a tree-hugger. The &lt;i&gt;indignity&lt;/i&gt;.
Would you like to see a demonstration? It was commonplace in the days of Braccus Rex, but the technology has lain dormant since then. We have Dallis to thank for her revival of the tool that will save us all!
Those are the breadcrumbs, torn and tossed aside along the long road to the Master.
Oh- Oh my...
They&apos;re gone now. The Magisters took them already. I guess now they&apos;re cured? And maybe they&apos;re waiting for me back at home.
Dead Chancellor
*Wish to be able to wipe your enemies from sight.*
The Eternal tried to kill us for our Source.
*Back away - this has nothing to do with you.*
I could certainly go for a tasty morsel...
Did she, now? Well. I know someone who&apos;ll be losing her income. I need to think about this...
*Say that that&apos;s true enough. Shake her hand. Lohse, you presume?*
[HERO] *Proclaim that you&apos;re proudest of the moments where you could save the lives of others.*
*Say that even though he didn&apos;t ascend at the Council of Seven, you still support him.*
*By the Divine, that&apos;s foul! Walk away from the wretched soul.*
*Another step.*
*The spirit floats in front of you, his eyes unfocused and darting from side to side.*
No-one is safe as long as this machine stands. Trash it!
*You don&apos;t like any of this. Not the creature, not the console. Let them both be.*
This armour - it is mine! &lt;i&gt;Give!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you hope your burdens will be lifted.*
*Assure him the caravan will arrive soon.*
*Reach out to wipe the tears from the statue&apos;s eyes.*
&lt;i&gt;Today I not kiiiiiiiill you, leg-meat.&lt;/i&gt;
It was Tarrrquin, that wrrretch! That rrrat! I ate an ill mouse and passed in my sleep, and the brrrooding boorrr brrrought me back on a larrrk!
*Did you expect a needle?*
Awakened Construct
You bein&apos; coy?
Dead...? I was treating that poor girl - I was going to &lt;i&gt;save her!&lt;/i&gt;
*Hannag? Tell Lyn you met her not too long past. She was set upon by Magisters, but she and a friend of hers made short work of them.*
What weapons? What basement?
*Ifan leaps to push you forwards. You stumble to the ground. As you stagger back to your feet, Ifan draws his weapon and advances on you...*
Puxk Bloodspawn
*Ask what happened here.*
[BARBARIAN] *Ask him if there were any survivors. Maybe someone remains that needs their head bashed in!*
Escape.
Skeleton of an Ancient Warrior
Leaping Flames
I took my god into my soul. Having reached my potential, I can find the Council of Seven on the Nameless Isle. I will go to the Well of Ascension and claim Divinity.
Armoured Goblin Sentinels
[MYSTIC] *Explain that you&apos;re just a spiritualist who never foresaw this future.*
Oh, but I&apos;ve told you about that many times before, haven&apos;t I? Silly me.
*The dwarf yanks at one of the nearby ropes to no avail.*
With Justinia dead,
We restored the Swornbreaker.
*She steps towards you, cradling your skull in the soft skin of her hands. &apos;It doesn&apos;t matter, my child.&apos; she whispers. &apos;Nothing matters now that we&apos;re together.&apos;*
Let it not be said that I ever failed in my duty. Very well, Godtaint, your enemies shall be wiped from your sight.
The Vulture&apos;s Legs
This large crimson gem contains an impish pocket realm. The gem begs to be used.
Now leave us to do our work.
I would sooner die than put faith in your words, Source monster.
Of course you are. Or do you mean to tell me memory is so fleeting within the hollows of that windswept head of yours that you don&apos;t recall me running my dainty tongue along your arm?
You&apos;ll see - you&apos;ll see my lord&apos;s brilliance. Not in this life, but perhaps the next.
Soon prince became emperor, and his armies marched on their neighbours.
*You see myriad wings flapping, your hand scattering bird seed. You hear the screeching of eagles, the tearing of flesh. All of your life is centred on this place, this pedestal of death. All of your life is dedicated to feeding your eagles the meat of your dearly departed people.*
*Say you have no interest in another moniker at this point in your life.*
Restore [1].[2][3]
*Thank him for the compliment.*
Not particularly.
The statue of Lucian at the Path of Blood judges those who come before it - deciding whether they have lived pure lives or not.
Mmmm, who are you, you lovely little fairy?
Although I can feel its distance. It is in the hands of another now. Perhaps &lt;i&gt;they &lt;/i&gt;will use it to purge the Seven traitors of all divinity, as I had hoped to.
Students! Bunch of worthless dolts...
You shouldn&apos;t have come here - now you leave me with no choice...
Report back to Lord Kemm.
Freedom! Ssssssweet... delicioussssss... freedom!
I&apos;m waitin&apos; for someone, and it ain&apos;t you. &lt;i&gt;Sod off!&lt;/i&gt;
Are you some kind of sadist - has our special day not had enough pain already? Or, are you... jealous?
Tongs
*Tell him not to worry, the weapons aren&apos;t in the basement any more.*
Join [1]
*Shake your head. You didn&apos;t lie. You had no idea what Jonathan was capable of.*
Change Campaign Metadata
*As you prepare to leave she wakes and calls for you.*
The Path of Blood is my legacy, and the legacy of my late departed fellows - I can&apos;t just give away its secrets! &lt;i&gt;Absolutely not! &lt;/i&gt;
*She looks up at you as if to answer but recoils at the sight of you and buries her face in her knees once more.*
Hannag Reborn
*The slug creature lets out a low, gurgling growl.*
I see you calculating how to use this power. I see those cogs spinning. Every avenue of your life is open to my gaze. Make no mistake, you owe me &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
The human mind is as simple as it is stubborn. My answer remains, as ever: no.
Pilgrim Camp
Come play, little Beast. Come die.
We told the spirit of Big Marge that the last unaffected egg was destroyed.
*The spirit fades to nothingness without so much as a whisper.*
Good luck. I hope you&apos;re made of sterner stuff.
*Tell him you&apos;re one such Godwoken. He can start begging any time.*
*Tell him it&apos;s good to know a man&apos;s price, then turn and walk away.*
I hardly need to tell &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;how these savages react to seeing bone.
Lone Wolf
*She twitches, worry creasing her forehead as she begins to stammer an answer to you.*
[LOHSE] *Shrug. At least his god isn&apos;t a dirty rat bastard, like the jerk in your head. *
Wait. You named your hat?
You&apos;ve been invited to join [1]&apos;s party.&lt;br&gt;Do you want to accept?
*Pick it up and try to rub off some of the grime.*
&lt;br&gt;Currently Unusable&lt;br&gt;
Gregor the Red
Are you sure you want to disconnect from the lobby?
Master
Kemm&apos;s Vault Notes
Meistr Siva&apos;s house has been ransacked. We should search for clues.
Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not going to hand you in for the bounty. Sure, you could do the very same to me.
*This... thing... must be stopped. Attack it, before more innocent lives are lost.*
[LOHSE] *He&apos;s possessed - there isn&apos;t much time. Ask what he wants you to do.*
Lady Kemm is known to harbour... those in need from foreign lands. I will be safe at her estate.
Yes?
Nice ode. Never understood elves, though. Too much thinkin&apos;, too much writin&apos;.
*Wonder why Lucian wanted to hunt down Godwoken - did he not want his legacy to be continued by them?*
*A thought suddenly enters your mind, though you&apos;re quite certain it isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;yours.&lt;/i&gt; You hear the voice of Rhalic in your head: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Do as she says.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
The ale will always get you in the end. Always.
You almost have to admire his cunning. To think that in his guise of Daeva he and I shared the finest wines in the realm; stories of life and love... But now I know where he hides, afraid of his own name.
I must say, you may not be an Eternal, but you are certainly not as temporary as many of your fellows. You handled yourself well.
And so I finally have all three! Seven bless you for your troubles! Although, no greater blessing really, than lots and lots of precious things!
Smoke
I came here on business. He said I might find you along the way. Wasn&apos;t sure if I would, after everything that&apos;s happened here.
Dwarven Holy Book of Matrimony
But the potion is of no use to anyone but us!
Yes, milady. He &lt;i&gt;jests.&lt;/i&gt;
Atusa, please!
A sumptuous, velvet pouch used for holding small trinkets, coins, or herbs. Likely the property of a noble.
*Ask if he&apos;d like to tag along for another journey - just you and him.*
I should&apos;ve seen that coming, I guess. Oh well.
H
Good luck. You may need it.
Deathfog. It&apos;s coming. It&apos;ll choke the living. It&apos;ll defile the dead.
Carry on then, stink-beast. Don&apos;t let little old me distract you from your very important stink-business.
&lt;i&gt;Held captive...?!&lt;/i&gt;
*The creature gingerly takes the plant into his bloodied hands. He runs his fingertips over the white flowers. His panting breath slows.*
I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve never pursued knowledge so dark. Braccus Rex&apos;s Source talents were great, but some of his skills and devices were... unfathomable. How he came by them, I can&apos;t say.
&lt;i&gt;What...? &lt;/i&gt;No, no... that is impossible. Lord Arhu put his remains to rest, and told us that no-one shall lay eyes on the Divine again, until he returns to us in all his glory.
Almira is dead.
*Take your leave.*
*Query further. Go far? What does she mean?*
Your life is not your own. Your life is for us all. I cannot say more. You see some day.
*Narrow your eyes. He&apos;s talking about genocide.*
I had the girl buried up in the Stonegarden. &apos;found an engraved necklace on her, afterwards. Natalie Bromhead - that was her name... &apos;hope she rests easy now.
I got that special shipment you was askin&apos; after...
There&apos;s a treasure chest up on a cliff, but it is guarded by an undead pirate.
Close. Watching. But not for you. For master.
A Simple Song
Work&apos;s waitin&apos;. No time for anything else. Get to the site or it&apos;s yer hide!
Defeat the dwarf.
A thought cannot mend a soul. A prayer cannot heal what has been ruined. You talk to soothe yourself, not me.
Shortbow
Ah, there you are. And with just the little demonic host I&apos;ve been looking for.
Day [1]
We&apos;ve got to find out exactly what that thing is. Then we might be able to help her get rid of it.
But anyway, duty calls.
And what kind of Divine was Ifan ben-Mezd as the world battled on?
A contract like this is no joke, friend.
I am the House of Shadows. I am the fate-weaver. I am the hand that guides a blind world. Even yours, Red Prince.
The Fence Sign
Everything looks in order, as far as I can tell.
*A sickly haze forms upon the glass, then shimmers and becomes... a Black Ring brute, huge and ugly. On seeing you, he raises an eyebrow...*
*Ask the healer what he can learn from her remains.*
*Nod your head. She can lead; you&apos;ll follow.*
Elven Axe
Samadel
*Hold fast. You&apos;ll smash his Soul Jar if he doesn&apos;t hand over his clothes and leave you be.*
*Concerns like training under evil Sourcerers?*
