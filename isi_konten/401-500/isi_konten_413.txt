&lt;b&gt;15th Aurantion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here begins the account of Wulfrum, lead archaeologist. Captain Aureus tells me there may be something worth excavating in this curious cave. I have hired a gaggle of locals with shovels. They insist this cave is haunted, but it&apos;s amazing the ghosts you can chase away with a heavy purse of gold.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;16th Aurantion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incredible! I&apos;ve never seen craftsmanship like this. Was it a tomb? A temple? The pillars to the Seven suggest &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; religious purpose. There is more, hidden behind a barrier. The workers are grumbling again, but I am an &lt;i&gt;expert&lt;/i&gt; on the undead. If their &apos;ghost&apos; was real, I would know!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;17th Aurantion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Idiots! The workers claim I&apos;ve been &apos;meddling with the gods&apos; (I only took a small chip from the pillar. I had to test it &lt;i&gt;somehow&lt;/i&gt;.) and now they&apos;ve sealed me down here. Nothing left but to examine the columns and hope they return. Each of the Seven seems tied to an element or a trait? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rhalic - Earth&lt;br&gt;Duna - Air&lt;br&gt;Tir-Cendelius - Blood&lt;br&gt;Zorl-Stissa - Fire&lt;br&gt;Vrogir - Muscle&lt;br&gt;Xantezza - Mind&lt;br&gt;Amadia - Magic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;18th Aurantion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I- I don&apos;t think I&apos;m alone. I was sure I heard a voice as I slept, but I couldn&apos;t make it out. It was faint. An echo, almost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;19th Aurantion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s here. It&apos;s real. Whatever it is, it&apos;s real. The Guardians help me...
I should just give it up already... here, follow me. I have something for you.
My apologies, prince! I&apos;ll be better momentarily... In two shakes of a lizard&apos;s tail, yes.
Arggggh!
What a waste.
*The wood groans and creaks. A face appears in the wood, tortured and tormented. A six-sided indentation is carved on its forehead, as if a gem or amulet had made a mark there.*

Lemme guess: You&apos;re here for a match. Dunno what you heard, but they won&apos;t take it easy on you just cause you&apos;re an elf.
After we tear divinity off its pedestal? And we spread its powers to the people?

*Lohse smiles broadly and casts her gaze over the ship&apos;s top deck. She sighs, relieved, and nods.*
*Express interest. Who was this miracle worker?*
Never mind, Lohse. Let her listen if she&apos;s so very interested.
*The pained spirit moans in fits and starts. It speaks no words, but no matter: its contorted face betrays the torture it endures.*
Smoke Cloud
Nope, won&apos;t budge.
*More the latter than the former. You don&apos;t plan to put your feet up any time soon.*
Overpowered
Well... I &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;be able to tell you exactly what&apos;s inside you. Might be any number of things: A ghost, a floater, a lucid dreamer who took a wrong turn somewheres...
Yes, well, I suppose there is that upside.

*Sigh* From the mouth of babes. Well, you don&apos;t have to be nice to be a good sort. You&apos;ll see. I&apos;ll tell him what you did here. He&apos;ll be grateful.
Enough to matter. Not enough to stage a coup. The Voidwoken have people terrified - not only for their lives, but for the very air they breathe, the sun that shines upon them.
