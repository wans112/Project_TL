*The ancient altar before which the deer crowded sits stark in the dappled forest light. Something about it draws you in - it seems to emit a faint, pleasing heat.*
Where will your kingdoms be in one hundred years? In one thousand?
Antique Sword
*Her hands fan furiously across the tomes, like a pianist&apos;s upon the keys.*
Spirit of the Red Prince
Black Ring Painweaver
&lt;i&gt;Why?&lt;/i&gt;
I am no fool, thief
We have Spirit Vision. If spirits linger at the caravan, we may be able to talk with them.
[BEAST] *Tell her it&apos;s been... awhile. You&apos;ve been so focused for so long. There&apos;s been no time...*
We went on our way without helping Beryl Griff.
Fine. I&apos;m not gonna argue. But get moving, before I change my mind.
*Surrounding the lake is a throng of figures. Your worshippers. Our worshippers. They will deliver your rightful power to you. You will be as gods.*
Oh, hi! You&apos;re a dwarf. My best friend is a dwarf. Her name is Esthyr. She&apos;s smaller than me, but stronger, too. I&apos;ll see her when I get home!
Oh, wonderful! It&apos;s like I always said: everyone&apos;s got a melody in &apos;em - ya just gotta look. Me brother Laslor couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket when he was a wee thing. Now, he&apos;s got the voice of an angel.
*Nod sadly. You understand. You might have done the same thing.*
Bigger&apos;n what she&apos;s already managed? Say a single word against &apos;er, and a royal copper will throw yeh in a dank cell - or carve the royal insignia on your throat. Unless ya got a handful of coin to &apos;donate&apos; to the kingdom, of course.
Elemental Devil Idle
*Ask the rat how Dallis used this book.*
*Say you&apos;re about to.*
They... killed &lt;i&gt;everyone,&lt;/i&gt; and my ma got &apos;em to chase her, and she went across the bridge, and then she raised the bridge and, and, and she told me to run, and now she&apos;s stuck over there with them!
*The child&apos;s sobs lilt like a sad song over the quietness in the cove.*
No. But you were the most fit. You were the most capable. And so I placed the future of our people on your shoulders.
Might well be, but that ain&apos;t helpin&apos; either of us sleep at night. Don&apos;t misunderstand me now, I feel for the lass.
Memory: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
But that time has passed. I saw that forest reduced to a dead place, then I was taken away. My memories were lost, like the leaves from my branches...
*She flinches as you move closer.*
Come, prince: ascend to the sanctuary of Amadia! You&apos;ll find you&apos;re not the only guest here, but surely you are its most honoured one!
*Amidst the placid little pond, the face of a goddess lies half-submerged in the water.*
We&apos;re done here.
Bust of Duna
Iron Fists
Well I am happy, of course! This is what I wanted. My people are restored. My world is at least close to what it once was.
*Nod with understanding, adding that she&apos;s lucky to have work, when so many face hardship.*
As escapees, we&apos;ll likely be attacked on sight.
*Ask if he&apos;s the one who painted &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian.*&lt;/i&gt;
Beds
Slasher
We found Kemm&apos;s secret vault. Maybe Arhu is hiding inside?
Blessings of the Divine upon you, milady! My husband and I were just sitting down for a picnic under the sun. We haven&apos;t much to offer, but would you care to join us?
Paste
M... ma? What happened? What did you do...? I thought you were going to help!
*Isbeil speaks once again on your rousing achievements.*
*Remind him that you&apos;re no soldier, but you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; strong: if you ascend, you won&apos;t follow orders from anyone.*
Ifan! My wolf! Come... come closer... so that you may see me... as I truly am...
First amongst wizards, the legendary Zandalor can bend even air and water to his bidding.
It&apos;s a small ship. His name was Finn. Oddball; looked to me like he saw something he wished he hadn&apos;t, before he came here.
*The dwarf shakes his head with irritation, before turning back to the fish.*
I knew I could count on you, my beautiful darling big sister. Go. Hurry. Do it. Lucian must be freed from the Seekers post-haste!
*Tell her she was a fool to defy one as powerful as Braccus Rex.*
*Give the brute what he asks for.*
Ha! Of course you never found it. You always lacked imagination, &lt;i&gt;Lady &lt;/i&gt;Amadia.
Ugh. Please. Go away. You&apos;re sadder than one of those mutilated children the Lone Wolves leaves behind. Alive, but only barely. It&apos;s pathetic.
Encounters
To be fair, you are barely more powerful than one, now that the Source has been ripped from you - and even more ripped from me.
*...in pleasure.*
*He does not resist in the least, merely slumps to the ground with one final gurgle.*
*Ask if he has any advice for the new Divine.*
*Nod to the cage. Who is this child?*
One of the kiddies on board made it out alive - told us a-l-l-l-l about it. But don&apos;t worry. Manslaughter happens.
*Turn to take your leave.*
*Sigh, and say you just wanted some tea.*
*Tell him it&apos;s like sitting down to a feast and not knowing what to taste first.*
Death is preferable to servitude. He&apos;s a lucky man.
Bishop? Wait... Alexandar is here...? This elven temple may warrant investigation...
*Explain that actually, you wanted to talk to her about Gareth.*
Why do you do this? Stay put as I speak to you!
I know it isn&apos;t easy, but we need to end them. Yes, they will vanish. They won&apos;t go on to the Hall. They&apos;ll simply... cease to be. But if we don&apos;t do this, there will be no stopping Adramahlihk. This sea of candles will grow larger. He won&apos;t stop.
For far too long, people have obeyed the gods, obeyed the Order, obeyed the Ring... obeyed whatever authority stood up and told them what to do.
*The dwarf starts at the sound of your voice, gripping the woman&apos;s arm for a moment before he relaxes.*
*She takes your hand and places it on the bottle, on its side between you.*
Respect the Reds? &lt;i&gt;Disgraceful!&lt;/i&gt; Get out of my face, would ya? I ain&apos;t talking to no damn Reds lover!
A rattling sack like you has no place at my side.
But for the might of your own magic, the House of Shadows would have finally had its way. But for your own awing strength, the day would have ended with your death instead of your downfall.
Can&apos;t keep your hands to yourself, eh? Well I&apos;ve got a fix for that.
*Inform her you are not an animal and refuse to be yoked like one.*
Not for them, of course, but it&apos;s significantly more relaxing for me.
The prophecy, the secret that the House of Dreams has safeguarded for countless millennia, says that when &apos;the Red Prince and the Red Princess unite, their children will be dragons, and through their union all lizards will be dragons again&apos;.
Someone, help! Criminal on the loose!
So many words begin with an S. No need to bandy about the one I so tire of hearing.
*Shake your head and keep your gold.*
Pathetic little creatures...
Lucian&apos;s blessings to you, stranger. I am Sister Avenny - the Head Priestess of the Cathedral.
*Suddenly, the feeling vanishes. The figure relaxes.*
*Shake your head. You don&apos;t know anyone that can do &lt;i&gt;that.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Scoff and say he really has no sense of humility, does he?*
*She reaches for Sebille&apos;s cheek with a sure hand and softly traces her scar with her thumb.*
...ambition chosen, life of few surprises.
*The cook&apos;s stony facade curdles into an angry snarl.*
*Take your leave.*
You cannot stop until you&apos;ve reached the apex of your powers.
The hollowed out carapace of a giant crab. This stinky little number is good for fending off blows... and admirers.
But be sure this news remains only with him. He&apos;s not prone to gossip, but my affairs in Arx must be kept... private, as it were.
Paladins promise the Good Counsel School will reopen soon! People respond: No hurry!
[LIZARD] *Sneer that if you were intent on killing him, he&apos;d be dead already.*
[VILLAIN] *Tell her you remember her in spite of having tried to forget.*
Unhand that, thief!
I know of a way we can find &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;demon&apos;s home plane. If we can find it... we can &lt;i&gt;destroy &lt;/i&gt;it. It will leave Adramahlihk severely weakened. Weak enough to kill.
So who was it that sent you? Gow? Caird? Well, you can tell him that...
Bandit Dwarf Assassin
More the fool, they.
Saving Magister Mihaly
[LIZARD] *Ask what in the seventh hell a kinsman is doing heaped on the floor beside him.*
*She looks you up and down.*
Nice work killing those Voidwoken. The family will want to meet you.
But why does a dragonkin leave the Ancient Empire? Why does a dragonkin come to such a dark place?
No AI
On hearing that the Shadow Prince&apos;s heart was eaten, the Elven Scion thanked us for killing him, but offered no reward.
Workbench
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without retrieving our stuff.
We didn&apos;t rescue your barren land from the Great Acorn to see it turned over to someone even worse than your damned people!
*Squints.* Dun&apos;t that depend onna weather? Anyway...
&lt;i&gt;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&lt;/i&gt;
The Magisters have kept records on all known Sourcerers. Especially the ones not yet captured. They would be an invaluable resource.
*He&apos;s right; hand over the Purging Wand with an embarrassed smile.*
Thane Wulfric
What a beautiful day. What a happy day!
*An elf, clad in strange spore-like armour, holds a helm in her hand, apparently wrenched from the vine-choked corpse of a Paladin at her side. She places it overhead - and &lt;i&gt;stiffens&lt;/i&gt;.*
[DWARF] *Note that the sooner things settle down in the Kingdom, the better. Ask what else is happening.*
Loremaster level too low
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 28: Blood Elementals
*Angrily demand that she tell you what she saw.*
Something closed the door...
*You think of the Magisters and the Sourcerers they hunted - and of the good and the evil on both sides.*
Overgrown Statue of Tyran
*Say that you&apos;re not her &apos;child.&apos; She made that clear.*
You have a lesson that needs learning, prisoner!
Your mind is as simple as it is stubborn. My answer remains, as ever: no.
Soulcatcher
*Suddenly, for the first time since you first saw his face, he shows you fear. The God King promised him immortality, but now...*
&apos;The following subversives known as Seekers have been confirmed as dead or apprehended:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Duggan (dwarf, male) * Allister (human, male) * Klaude (dwarf, male) * Var-Tayx (lizard, male) * Leya (human, female) * Dorrick (human, male) * Exter (human, male) * Kerban (human, male) * Hallorn (dwarf, male) * Tarlene (human, female) * Constance (human, female)&apos;
*She recoils, horrified at the thought.*
I&apos;ll do you one better. I&apos;ll take you there.
*Whimpers* Buddy. My Buddy. I love Buddy. I miss Buddy!
What a way to die, down here in this darkness. Poor soul...
Uuugh...
Voidwoken attacks increase! Citizens warned to be alert!
S&apos;ppose I&apos;ll have to settle for bein&apos; admired then. It&apos;s still better&apos;n bein&apos; a dog!
*Still your eyes meet, scanning for hidden layers of deceit.*
Hey! Loud-mouth! What gives?
failed.
*Say you&apos;d prefer a potion to the contents of her cupboards.*
[Translate3_ef7aa81f-b9fc-467b-bab5-130f4656e285]
*Ifan steps between you and Roost, head high and hands wide.*
Her Royal Highness may tolerate your presence, if you continue showing decorum. Remember what I told you though - she is not in a mood to tolerate fools...
*Pull back. Ask what he&apos;s doing, he was &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; with Sadha!*

You know how to use that thing, right?
