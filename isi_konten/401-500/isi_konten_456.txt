I was given my needle by the Master. Guess I&apos;m just sentimental like that.
Game options.
*By felt tents in a desert oasis, the heat of the sun burns down upon you.*
I haven&apos;t, but that doesn&apos;t mean much. Arhu was never exactly open about his business.
*Nod. You are. And by the looks of that collar around his neck, so is he.*
Campaign List
One by one and two by two, they all fall down, they do, they do...
Great!
So fast... Like lightning before the thunder...
*You don&apos;t intend to take sass like this from a &lt;i&gt;sheep&lt;/i&gt;. Take your leave instead.*
I would hope we are all more than we seem at first glance.
There... now wait... wait...
Why, that&apos;s Peeper! Let me get a good look - yes, I couldn&apos;t mistake it. That&apos;s Marge&apos;s favourite egg!
Whatever you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;You&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;be in charge.
[MYSTIC] *...a stately dragon. It spreads its wings and roars. Such power!*
It&apos;s so much bigger than I imagined.
Makes lighting on different objects more realistic. Disabling this improves performance.
*The creature&apos;s breath quickens as you approach and it shrinks slightly, as though it expects you to strike it.*
Stand down!
Although only open water remained, by instinct ships would steer clear.
*Cough* I already said thank you. Now piss off.
*Tell him you&apos;re not sure. The two of you should wait here for reinforcements.*
Why don&apos;t you gather the troops. We&apos;ll need to leave this place in a hurry, when the time comes.
*She locks an icy glare on you.*
*He takes the copper with a nod of gratitude. His sleeve slips back, above his elbow. In its crook, you see part of a tattoo - a pattern of concentric circles, rendered in black...*
*Note that she just blamed the Voidwoken on the Magisters. Ask why.*
*The apparition clasps your face in its shaking hands. You suddenly feel your eyes tingle. Everything becomes brighter, sharper; blacks and whites become glorious bursts of colour, then fade back into their accustomed spectrum.*
Have I yet to disappoint Your Highness in matters of security?
*You are a priest of the kin, your face raised to the sun, your blood warming to the heat upon your skin. All is well. And then all is not well; cries of war come from the shore. And death comes quick.*
When enabled, the hotbar will automatically remove skills that you unmemorise in the skill window.
Here? Now? This is hardly the time or the place.
Heretic!

Mona must have been a professional adventurer at some point in time, because these pants are none too shabby!
Back away. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;. No entry.
Handmade Mage Armour
Skeleton Key
Just because Blaithin says we&apos;re friends doesn&apos;t mean we are. If her name&apos;s all you got, might as well twinkle your little toes back on outside. We done here?
*Tell him you found the stash, but someone else had gotten there first.*
You really don&apos;t have to look that far.
*The dwarf turns away from you with a growl, putting his arm around the girl in a tender, but firm gesture. She sniffles quietly into his shoulder, refusing to even look at you.*
Someone needs to help them. Someone like us. Someone like &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
*The Meistr leans in to speak, her eyes cold and unrelenting.*
*He bows his head in deference and sinks to one knee. He begins to pray...*
*The spirit lies where she fell, her prayers abruptly ended.*
[SCHOLAR] *Something about this bird seems oddly familiar. Ask what species it is.*
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I&apos;ve walked this earth, each vale and peak...
How many ghosts do you think have haunted &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt;
You let yourself be scarred; you let yourself be manipulated and puppeteered.
Mmmpphh...
*Ask him about his master. Perhaps he&apos;d know more.*
Not Enough Action Points
Staff Kit Part II: Carving
Blessed Pilgrim&apos;s Pants
[LOHSE] *Laugh it off. Whatever it was, you were just playing. Or they deserved it. Either or.*
Newbies oughta know what happens to an elf who steps outta line.
Hands to yourself. *Mumbles* Bloody Sourcerer...
Fool... you have broken the seal!
My god gave me Spirit vision so I can speak to the dead and Source Vampirism so I can consume their Source.
My soul. Mine to claim! What remains is yours, and more yet awaits you in the future, my prince. You just need recognise true reward when you see it.
*Stride away.*
With it you take my gratitude, and my fervent wish that we never again set eyes on each other, as long as we shall live. Goodbye.
Arx City Guide - Volume Five
Only the grave could have tamed the Beast. It was necessary - but my heart is heavy.
The God King ruled. We who were loyal wanted for nothing. The children of the Seven were enslaved, their gods forgotten. This is my legacy.
Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just find a way back to the ship.
Heh. So, we do this now?
They remove all the Source from within. The husk that remains is left empty... soulless. Easily controlled.
[LIZARD] [FEMALE] *Move to kiss him.*
You can&apos;t shut my mouth with such a paltry sum.
Not enough AP to reach destination!
Squire Kendrick
[IFAN *He knew you by name. Ask how that&apos;s possible.*
We&apos;ll meet the Mistake at Lucian&apos;s tomb; from there he&apos;ll lead us to Lucian himself.
Creeping little flies...
Maybe it&apos;s connected to some other mechanism?
*Scoff* Whatever. I have no time for tall tales. Come with me.
*Clear your throat and ask, while you&apos;re here, if she could get this collar off you?*
Perhaps there are more of them to come.
*Nothing happens. The spirit darts its eyes about, all the more tortured by its failure to return home. It is trapped. By what or by whom, you cannot say.*
*The Magister plucks the petals from a daisy while muttering to herself in a hazy voice.*
You should not have seen that...
Ice Fan
*Tell him you&apos;ll choose once you&apos;ve heard his plan.*
*The laughter hangs harsh upon his lips. But the light that dances in his eyes is black. His mind has gone. His insanity follows him into death.*
Let the creature live. He is hardly worth our time.
Whist now child, it&apos;s okay. We&apos;re okay.
How interesting. I can&apos;t find what I&apos;m looking for, but I still found plenty of reason to arrest you!
*Tell her that if there&apos;s a woman she longs to be, that means she wants to be different. To be &lt;i&gt;better.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Flash her a look of confidence. You can handle whatever she&apos;s got.*
*You see him, on pain of purging, guide Magisters into the cavern depths, there to continue their secret dig. You see him float above the traps, or vanish in one place and re-appear in the next.*
Damage is based on the Physical Armour of your shield.
And the tablet...?
[[1]] [2]
I saw the light, but not in the way they&apos;d expected. I heard the voice. Lucian himself. He gave me the truth. He told me to carry it. He made me &lt;i&gt;real. &lt;/i&gt;And he showed me Arhu and the Seekers...
How many of you creeps do I have to beat?
My powers are spent, Godwoken. Perhaps one of my colleagues can still help you. Otherwise, I wish you luck on your path.
*Remark that the Magister prisoner must be quite nervous by now - has she talked?*
*Tell him you were born lucky.*
*This bastard wants you to kill the woman you love! But he could help you find her... &lt;i&gt;Feign agreement.&lt;/i&gt; Say you&apos;ll kill her.*
It&apos;s like I told you. You get what you want - if I get mine.
Duna. The Gods. Are they dead? How can this be?
You know, now that I think about it... Flora was got rid of last week, wasn&apos;t she? Who the hell are you then? Buvver off!
Hmmm, I think I&apos;ll stay off that particular device...
Who told you you could touch that?
Pox if I know. I&apos;m not in the habit of questioning orders. Or explaining myself to strangers, now I think on it.
*The Magister shrugs.*
Strength
He twists &apos;n&apos; rubs and tweaks the nubs, he strokes &apos;n&apos; pokes like all the blokes...
Rhalic turns his face to the Sun.
*Sigh* Looks like it&apos;s just you and me, stumply.
Those days are over. Only one can don his head with stars and wield the sources of infinity.
Set Health
The life I traded for my &lt;i&gt;soul.&lt;/i&gt;
Chtylchia, Mistress of Agony
Isn&apos;t a healthy business environment just wonderful? Grog and his pathetic bridge give me just the little kick of competition I need to improve my service... and increase my prices.
*Look at her in horror. But you&apos;ve grown rather fond of the mortals...*
Set Attitude
Serve Ryker.
Maybe that&apos;s why I ain&apos;t landed a mark in awhile. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;unhappy&lt;/i&gt;.
Elven Statue
Lifeboat
Character is protecting nearby allies.
*Ask her what she means - how did the kiss change her?*
You can&apos;t teach a fool anything...
Chronicles
One moment, sun. The next, I feel darkness inside me. Then, noise. So much noise. Clank, moan, clink, groan.
Every thug in the city is taking advantage of the chaos. We&apos;re trying to keep the commotion to a minimum, but the rats are crawling out of every corner.
*Tatcher looks interested indeed.*
Hrrr hrrr hrr hrr.
I do believe that&apos;s the worst thing I&apos;ve ever had a hand in.
In order to pass the first chamber, you&apos;ll need an amulet that&apos;s charged with Source. Five souls&apos; worth, to be precise.
Alexandar has been seen alive once more. He&apos;s on the Nameless Isle.
*Admit you hadn&apos;t expected her to escape Fort Joy.*
*Ask what Hallorn believed in.*
Well, look what the dog dug up. You&apos;re lucky they didn&apos;t notice just &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;thin you were under those bandages.
No, not my princess! She was going to lead the fire slugs into a golden age!
*Make her an offer: instead of killing you, she could &lt;i&gt;join&lt;/i&gt; you.*
It wins. It wins and I lose.
*Try a different approach.*
I stand by my decision. Those weren&apos;t just flames. They were &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;m not like him.
*Ignore his question, and note that he seems a little... smitten with Gareth...*
Capital.
*You should perform the Meistr&apos;s ritual one last time, here or in Siva&apos;s vault.*
Raise Bloated Corpse Scroll
Ah, I see you&apos;ve managed to use the stairs without my supervision or guidance. Miraculous.
*Beast bristles the moment he sees his fellow dwarf, and slams his right fist into his left palm, growling all the while.*
*She looks distraught. Is she okay?*
*As you kiss, you can feel one of her hands grabbing you by the back of the neck as the other slides down in between your legs.*
Sourcerers deserve only one fate: death!
Ancient Plate
Fane
Impressive Painting
*Refuse. You&apos;re not showing them anything.*

So?
*Rub the bridge of your nose. A fish golem, perhaps? A Void-beast drawn together into a hulking mass of guts and scale? You&apos;re sure you&apos;ve heard of a charnel golem before -*
*With barely a last word about trolls, the scholar is gone, evaporated completely in total, eerie silence.*
*She averts her gaze from yours. Her lower lip trembles as she speaks.*
Gods&apos; graves - please, be quick!
Search for the Black Ring cave.
*Ifan raises an eyebrow, but accepts your embrace. He pulls you close, resting his cheek on your head. When you pull away, he reluctantly parts from you with a smile.*
*Tell her she has much to account for. The Deathfog&apos;s been deployed. Perhaps thousands are dead.*
We did not use such cruelty lightly. There was no other choice.
Fascinating... most fascinating...
Now why would I go and do a thing like that, freshie? I don&apos;t owe you nothin&apos;.
