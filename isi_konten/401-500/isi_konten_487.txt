The Lord Dread told us that it carried Dallis and Vredeman, along with their &apos;soldiers with no souls&apos; to Arx. Curiously, the ship also claimed that both Dallis and Vredeman were older than it, despite it having lived as an Ancestor Tree and an elf prior to its current form. A mistake surely...?
Blinding Radiance
*Ask the price.*
You will suffer, Fane the Eternal. You and your damned Seven lords - you will all suffer.
*No. Say she&apos;s nothing but trouble.*
Far be it from me to judge the plain, simple mind that dwells within that man&apos;s skull, but... No. Simply no.
*This is... disgusting and despicable. Confront the creature. It must explain this carnage!*
You have an ill-fated face. Tell me, who are you to come to Amadia&apos;s sanctuary?
Why don&apos;t we make a deal, then. You help me get out of this place, and I&apos;ll do the same for you.
*Say farewell.*
The curse is everlasting. Whenever I am honoured, I will suffer for it. Braccus saw to that.
Run! Death stalks us!
Returned to intangible spirit form.
*Beast chuckles at the confused pause that follows.*
*Give him a firm farewell handshake - and tell him it was good to catch up.*
Your help is indeed appreciated. Almost as appreciated as your Source shall be once it is ripped from your body.
Well, I can use the coins. Now go on, before I change my mind.
A Kallavian arrowhead, notched in the traditional manner and steeped in an enigmatic potion designed for those who operate using deceit and obfuscation.
There&apos;s only one way... yes, there&apos;s only one AWK-AWK thing to do...
Not much. At least not yet. Perhaps you&apos;d have better luck, given your credentials.
Some are still good. Whatcha looking for?
Your lizard lover finally returned to the Ancient Lizard Empire, there to found the newest and most popular of all the houses - the House of Love.
Venom Coating
The Red Prince returned to the Empire, to a hero&apos;s acclaim - and soon became emperor. He used the war on the Void to expand the Empire. The war with the demons gave him battles aplenty, and he relished them all.
*Say you&apos;ll be glad to help her if you can.*
Remove the magical barrier.
*Ask Sebille where&apos;s she&apos;s from. Where&apos;s home?*
Magical Laced Scale Gloves
*Tell her you will, then bid her goodbye.*
Jahan told me that the demon he seeks is the same demon I hear in my head. Once I find this demon&apos;s name, he will exorcise me.
*Say that you thought it belonged to you, but now see that you were mistaken.*
A rare, high-value gemstone called &apos;Gods-heart&apos; by the faithful Dwarven miners of the mountain region.
Hey!
It was paw. Heehee!
Ros asked us to keep her safe. I don&apos;t see why we shouldn&apos;t honour his request.
*You smoke, and feel adrift.*
As well you should! I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like you, for instance.
*Ask him what the incident was that made him run afoul of the law in the first place.*
W-what...? No, wait! I&apos;ll tell you; w-we had orders to bring down the wall. They thought there was more to find beyond it.
I. Have. Heard. ENOUGH.
*He enters combat stance and readies his weapon. Battle is at hand.*
Nope!
There is no fame here, and no melodies either. Only the accursed.
*The cat looks up at you and gives you a groggy meow in thanks.*
Dwarven Dagger
*Stand before her in awe. It was she who saved you from the shipwreck that brought you here?*
Target two circular areas. Swap surfaces and clouds.
You&apos;re coming with me. I see you can&apos;t keep your hands off of things that don&apos;t belong to you.
Is... is it dead...?
How long has it been possessing you?
Lavafall. No escape!
[RED PRINCE] *Smirk. You know &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. Obviously.*
Charming as our conversations are, perhaps now is not the best time?
*The man half-shrugs and half-nods, agreeing to disagree.*
*Tell him you want to trade.*
You&apos;re in the wrong place then, I fear... this island&apos;s a cauldron of suffering, right through to the roots in the ground... you know of Braccus Rex, I assume...?
If I could fill my bowl with &apos;sorries&apos; I&apos;d be a very fat elf! Good day to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, sir.
Engulfed in deadly fumes, receiving damage each turn.
&lt;i&gt;Thank the gods. &lt;/i&gt;
Though this is no more than standard-issue military equipment, every weapon tells its own story. The cleanliness of this one seems to suggest that it belonged to a Magister who was none too zealous about protection of the Divine Order.
I&apos;ll be your home.
[BEAST] *Your mind flashes through a catalogue of cheap, half-forgotten nights. Nothing stands out. Shrug and say you don&apos;t know.*
Full Metal Coat
That right, Han?
Ryker&apos;s Dusty Letter
[HERO] *Divinity can only be granted to the best. You have to say, you agree with the Gods.*
[HERO] *Say whoever did this should be brought to justice.*
&lt;i&gt;Happy hunting.&lt;/i&gt;
*She scoffs.*
*A push, a pivot, and now you suddenly face her, the needle still all too deeply embedded in bone.*
Bone Spider Matriarch
*She holds a hand to her face and turns her back to you. You cannot see her tears, but you don&apos;t doubt that several now roll down her cheeks.*
*You release her and apologise, you didn&apos;t mean to cause offence.*
Don&apos;t make light of the Seekers&apos; sacrifices. Walk on. Don&apos;t look back. Let the Mistake remain where it belongs: in the past.
I&apos;ll tell you what ailed me. Lord Kemm ailed me. Like any ally of the Black Ring, he irked me greatly. And you cured me of him. I thank you for that.
Exploration Theme 16 Light
1 point would add [1]% Critical Chance + [2] Initiative.
What did you do to them, Sourcerer?
Oh, it&apos;s ok. Here. This is for you. Because we&apos;re friends.
A surprise flash that can inflict blind in a [1] radius. Creates a small fire surface with a [2] radius.
And I&apos;ll avenge my darling one.
Weâ€™ve heard rumblings about a laboratory the Magisters have tucked away somewhere in the city. Rumours say that they were working on something dangerous - look into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start your search by the Barracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L.K.
Deselect
It&apos;s the nicest thing &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ve &lt;/i&gt;ever said.
*Fair enough. Do as he says.*
*Leave the spirit be.*
I fear that an attack against the city might be imminent. Good Queen Justinia seeking to take advantage of the disarray in the Order, perhaps.
You take care, though.
Now I take it away.
I am a proud loyal to the Order. I would not dream of subverting our cause.
Told him the Divine&apos;d punish him for that nonsense if he kept it up. Told him and told him and told him &apos;til he couldn&apos;t see straight.
*The slight girl in front of you must be the youngest soldier you&apos;ve ever seen. She hums to herself, licking Magister blood from her fingers, then raises her chilling coal-black eyes to meet your gaze.*
Blocking: [1]%&lt;br&gt;
*Your palm connects with her cheek with a gentle tap. You recoil in shock: she- she&apos;s real?*
I won&apos;t forget you. Not for anything.
And what kind of Divine led the fight, as the world fought the demons?
Meistr Siva&apos;s Cellar
The &lt;i&gt;deal &lt;/i&gt;is as follows.
As authorised by His Honour, the White Magister Reimond&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the blessing of Dallis, at the Bishop&apos;s right hand&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reverence of Alexandar, son of the late Divine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This writ permits its possessor access to areas and information necessary to the fulfillment of the Divine Order&apos;s commands. No further permission shall be requested nor provided.
That is... unless they get &lt;i&gt;help.&lt;/i&gt;
*Eye him carefully. Why is he in a cage in the first place?*
*His face creases up in thought as he surveys the carnage all around. Turning back to look at you again, he shakes his head.*
*Shudder as you remember what you&apos;ve done. Search for Saheila.*
*He gives you a disdainful look.*

&lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;.
Ship - Infested Interior B
*He catches the soap. Looks at it. Takes a bite.*
Alexandar taught me what I needed to know. I no longer need the Sallow Man to reach the Council.
Happy, are you? And that is the truth? How curious to leave someone to fend for themselves in the face of death, then express happiness at their unexpected survival.
I have no patience for lies.
In a manner of speaking, my dear... but I am &lt;i&gt;so much more...&lt;/i&gt;
We destroyed the pillars restraining the catatonic little girl.
*Ifan rolls his sleeves back down and casually wipes some blood from his cheek. He nods at you, the shadow of a smile on his lips.*
*Apologise for your insensitivity.*
&lt;i&gt;*Come find me.&lt;/i&gt; Say you did. &lt;i&gt;Come be with me.&lt;/i&gt; Say you will happily oblige.*
*Ask the squirrel if he was trying to get your attention as you were coming into Arx.*
*Ask him how he managed to get aboard this ship.*
Higba is dead.
Not Ready
Greetin&apos;s, child. Rather far from home, you &apos;n&apos; I. An&apos; during such dark times...
Item is out of charges&lt;br&gt;
Isolated from the Alliance, the dwarves were ill-prepared when the demons attacked.
We killed an infernal lizard in the consulate, but the flames kept bringing it back to life.
[SCHOLAR] *Say you know everything.*
*Tell her you&apos;re quite eager to continue to the Nameless Isle.*
Thornfall
Hold [IE_CameraToggleMouseRotate] and move the mouse to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/font&gt; the camera. &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/font&gt; in or out using [IE_DefaultCameraZoomIn] and [IE_DefaultCameraZoomOut].
*The look on your face says you have to kill her now. You raise the dagger...*
Dead Black Ring Witch
The spirit of a dwarf appeared after we defeated Duna&apos;s Undertaker.
In that case, go forth and let the hunt commence.
I have... responsibilities here. I can&apos;t start running around outside the family. It just... it isn&apos;t done. But once we&apos;re out of here, none of that will matter. You&apos;ll meet me, won&apos;t you?
Sharpen this one, it might serve.
Your luck is runnin&apos; out. The Voidwoken&apos;s already taken a dive, ya see.
We don&apos;t know.
*Listen intently. Expose yourself to this unearthly voice.*
Lohar thinks he&apos;s double-crossin&apos; us. Looked all over this here hideout, though. Nothin&apos; points to no treachery, far as I can tell.
Poisoned Fish Pie
*Say you did, you just wanted to hear her say it. It&apos;s beautiful.*
*Growl at him that Sadha is dead.*
I feel it instantly. A great peace. He is gone. The one who destroys me. I am free again.

*...a stately dragon. It spreads its violet wings and deafens you with its roar.*
*Your words seem to jolt him back to the present moment. He shakes his head and the mask of hatred disappears. He smiles again, even wider than before, yet his eyes stay hollow.*
*You don&apos;t care about dwarven politics. Leave them to it.*
The tree will answer our queries. It is but a matter of time and torture.
*She jerks the coin from your fingers and gives you the stink-eye.*
I believe Malady recommended speaking to the ship&apos;s head when you were ready to leave. But I suppose it all depends on how much faith you put in a half demon...
Conjure Incarnate
Poisoned Spear
*Mention you&apos;ve heard his spirit can be freed.*
Hatch to the Underground
The witch&apos;s chicken-scratch handwriting is filled with antiquated language and arcane symbols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You understand that this is a recipe of some sort, but you cannot piece together the mystical concepts.
