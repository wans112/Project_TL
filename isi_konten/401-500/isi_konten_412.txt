My dear boy,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are missing you something awful today!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Doraghans have taken us in most generously and we live in as much comfort as we have a right to expect. Little Ladya helps on the farm during the day, and I go with Mrs. Doraghan to market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow marks a month since we lost Father. Ladya and I will have a picnic where the farmhouse used to stand. I’m making Father’s favourite – mince pie – and butter cookies in your honour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel so much safer knowing they took that Sourcerer to Fort Joy. Don’t think the Voidwoken will bother us anymore, now &lt;i&gt;she’s&lt;/i&gt; gone.&lt;br&gt;We do miss you, sweetheart. Take care of yourself, won’t you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All my love,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mother&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p.s. HI JACE THIS IS LADYA I MISS YOU A LOT COME BACK SOON!
*Accept the offer.*
He will not be pleased. There will be screams. *Giggle.* Screams to echo through the ages...
*One delicate leg reaches out and traces the line of your cheekbone. She pats your face gently with whatever a spider has instead of a foot. She backs off, as if she takes you to be one of her own kind.*
*Point out that the Magisters made an enemy out of you - not the other way around.*
Magical Sewn Scale Helmet
That isn&apos;t what I want for the realm. I&apos;m certain it isn&apos;t what you want, either. If we enter into an agreement, we can create something &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;. Something worth preserving.
*Smile. She&apos;s not too bad herself.*
Soothing Cold
Shackling!
So the dog&apos;s listening to the horses. Got it. What does the dog say to them?
My mind is very busy. You may rest here, but please keep to yourself.

*Ifan performs an elaborate pantomime of keeping quiet, one finger in front of his lips as he leans back against the wall.*
Yes, that&apos;s my boy! Did you know him? Finest physician in all of Reaper&apos;s Coast - top of his class! My, but it&apos;s been too long since I&apos;ve seen him.

You have to agree to the privacy statement before sending feedback.
Am I right?
We met Magister Yarrow. She&apos;s desperately searching for a Sourcerer named Migo.
Let me come to know you.
By letting this beast live, I sentenced a child to die. My only chance at redemption is to slay the monster. I&apos;ll take it...
*She nods, satisfied.*
*A badly constructed poem of epic length here describes how frames of power or mystical frames (the poem suggests one, or the other, or both) can be combined with a rune, to make that rune more powerful. The poem ends with a song about a rabbit.*
Would you look at that? Looking out for number one. I like that in a man.
Not likely anythin&apos; you can afford.
It wears the face of Zorl-Stissa, but speaks the tongue of beasts. How cruel.
Voidwoken! We meet again...
Oh darling, I thought you&apos;d never ask!
Tovah is dead.
Into Thin Air
I certainly plan to do the same.
Pyrokinetic Skillbook
If it&apos;s trade you&apos;re looking for, I&apos;ve made a habit of procuring items that can prove rather &lt;i&gt;useful &lt;/i&gt;inside these walls.
Another win for Murga... pity; she could have used a loss or two... a little taste of humility.
*Snap that there&apos;s nothing beautiful in death.*
So, Divinity is yours... or does it belong to some other? Is there someone else in there, &lt;i&gt;pulling the strings...?&lt;/i&gt;
[LOHSE] *Tell him the gods will, like, protect him or something.*
The Godwoken would fill your head with lies, Your Majesty. She merely wishes to cast doubt on our successful strategem.
Mmm?
the horrors of Fort Joy behind them.
I am... Braccus Rex! &lt;b&gt;I am the Source King -&lt;/b&gt;
*Take your leave.*
Cursed Electrified Water
[MYSTIC] *...a blue butterfly crawling from its chrysalis. A second chance at life.*
Poisoned Elven Stew
Matis, the wound is festering. It needs to be changed.
*The spirit&apos;s sneer intensifies.*
Surrender if you want. I&apos;ve done nothing wrong.
*Stare at him blankly. He thinks you&apos;re his what now?*
I - I believe that you will. I trust you.
It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; you. Someone, help!
To help expand our Source powers, Saheila connected us with the roots of Ancestor Trees across the world.
Yet all is just facade, a frail shell...
Your life.
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;BRIGHT FANG&lt;/b&gt;.*
Oh, but I don&apos;t just go around giving knowledge away like a... a common medium!
Ancestor Tree
*The stag head wobbles slightly upon the wall where its mounted. Nothing more.*
The Divine is not all-powerful. More powerful than any other, true, but not &lt;i&gt;all-&lt;/i&gt;powerful.
Gods! Lohar said I might meet the Beast &apos;round here, but somehow I&apos;m still surprised. Silly, when it makes all the sense in the world you&apos;d come after Justinia...
So few of us are left... a direct attack against the Black Ring would be suicide - I hope the Bishop has something else in mind.
Anytime, toots.
Oh, I hearrr enough stories. I see enough past. Every bite taken and memory gained means knowing a new atrocity.
*Spit at his feet and tell him to leave.*
Bring Garvan&apos;s head to the spirit of Liam.
If I can say nothing else for my current &lt;i&gt;companion&lt;/i&gt;, at least I can say it gave me a bit of character.
War Staff
Flopper.
Send the little bloke my way, next you happen upon him. I&apos;d like to see what a fine specimen the magicockAWKRAWKAWerel has produced.
Everything&apos;s gonna be alright... everything&apos;s gonna be alright... everything&apos;s gonna be alright...
...she saved my life, in fact.
Undead Lizard Elementalist
Eagle Eye
Not - *ugh* not quite as stupid as I imagined. I am still head of the Seekers, boy. I can &lt;i&gt;taste &lt;/i&gt;your Source. It wafts about you like honeysuckle on the breeze.
Oppose Crispin.
[This book describes the crafting of the Swornbreaker and, more importantly, its destruction. A scythe powerful enough to challenge the will of a God, it was broken in two - both shaft and blade - and hidden on the Nameless Isle, safely out of mortal hands.]
Skills
Ah. I see. That&apos;s not good. Although...
A demonologist might be able to help me. There may be one somewhere on the mainland.
They don&apos;t deserve to hear the rites, but I&apos;m no barbarian. Not like them.
Pfeh! Forget it. Thanks for tryin&apos; though. You&apos;re a good kid.
A dragon that marries an elf? That sounds silly!
Stop. Stop! Who - who goes there?
Ancient Passage
Happy to.
Bear
Godwoken prince... the Void seeks you...
Find Withermoore&apos;s Soul Jar.
I know I chose right. Should Lucian snub me in the Hall, as you snubbed me in life, my pride is still mine. I am prepared for him to rebuke me; it is the price of loyalty.
You do? But that&apos;s incredible... I can only imagine what ghoul-ridden depths you braved to find one!
Undead Elf Ranger
*You hear the dwarf&apos;s voice. You hear whispers of violence. You hear the screams of your friends...*
Fancy Bottle of Beer
*Take your leave.*
Where in the hell does that portal lead? I guess there&apos;s only one way to find out...
Return to the elderly couple.
*The Magister steps forward with a smile and draws his weapon.*
Doesn&apos;t take too kindly to lizards. Can&apos;t blame him. Make yourself useful to him, and he may change his tune.
Dwarven Polearm
This severed skeletal arm has a few bits missing. Probably thanks to an enterprising seagull.

You are so very, very welcome.

You&apos;re late. But if you still want to deliver a gift to the *ahem* happy couple, see the guard by the door in the general store.
Playing Dead
The lizard king. Stately when silent. Yet so great was his dissent, I was sure his shouts would split the ground open beneath us.
&lt;i&gt;Come back, Lohse. Come back.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that&apos;s not really how Divinity works.*
Well - yes. I have kept my ears to the ground, ghostly they may be. There is an archive. A library devoted to history and scholarship. There must be a record there of the elf that spawned the corrupted tree.
Keep yourself out of trouble, brother.
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you don&apos;t take orders from random civilians.*
Well, first things first.
And it just so happens I can help you with that, along with that whole &lt;i&gt;queen&lt;/i&gt; thing. Depending on what you can do for me.
The Knight was one of many in his clan, yet he is the last who remains. The House of Sturmgrave offered countless fearless fighters for the protection of the realm, and they were widely revered for their prowess in battle and the righteousness of their swords. Indeed, so much were they admired that lesser lords grew green with envy. One among them refused to be second-loved among the armies, second-honoured by the queen, and hatched a plan to undo the so-called &apos;House of Heroes&apos;. The lord ordered a terrible act: the pillaging and destruction of a small and peaceful town. Through careful manipulations, the wicked lord succeeded in fingering the Knights of the House of Sturmgrave as the culprits. All were tried, all found guilty by a corrupted judge, and all hanged. The Knight, a mere child at the time, never forgot the gravity of the injustice. The mark of the House of Sturmgrave, the House of Heroes, was upon the youth already, and as the child&apos;s strength and honour grew, so did the desire for justice. Now the Knight rides, leading the unrelenting charge against those who would inflict base misdeeds upon innocents.
*His fading eyes go wide with such abject fear it is terrible to behold...*
The Magisters attacked our camp back at the harbour... I caught one of their arrows right in my side. That would&apos;ve been a slow death; I&apos;ve seen it before...
*The tree-form spirit slowly, painfully, becomes aware of you once more.*
The hilt of a blade, I do believe. But clearly no ordinary blade...
We killed Garvan.
Evil? Yes - I suppose he is. I imagine that you think the same of me. Go on, call me what you like. I&apos;m not afraid of being the villain to your supposed &apos;hero&apos;. I&apos;m not nice, Lohse. I&apos;m just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
Look at those lazy sods, sleeping on the job.
Oh, really? Do you have any other shock news to share? Trolls are ugly? Dwarves are short? Lizards are scaly?

It gives me no pleasure to send one of my own into that evil place. We must protect ourselves and each other.

After all, none of it matters, does it?
The Divine Order unleashed it. I arranged it. But it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; who won that war.

If you&apos;d arrived a little later, you&apos;d be free to suffer your own fate here once they find you. I&apos;m sure Dallis would&apos;ve loved to watch that beautiful body squirm beneath her boot.
*Mmm...*

*Tell the spirit that the Gods have been badly beaten - their altars are unlikely to yield results.*

Search the cellar.
*Tell her not to be so dramatic. Gods are immortal after all.*
We acquired an unusual gem, decorated to look like an eyeball.
