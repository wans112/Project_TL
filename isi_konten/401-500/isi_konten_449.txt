I see you, brother... but I do not see myself... I was once an elf, that much I know. Then I passed, and grew into an ancestor tree in a beautiful forest of our kin...
*Sigh.* Then I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re forcing my hand, dear. A pity.
*Ask him about this place.*
*Hand her his ring as proof.*
*Two fingers of dust have settled on this petrified figure. Cracks spread outward from the chest, spidering across every limb.*
(For gods&apos; sake, Geraldine!)
Let me take a look, then. I promise it won&apos;t take long.
Platemail Equip
*Tell her she&apos;s a fool, praying to a dead Divine.*
No, I&apos;m not crying.
I bet you do.
Submission.
*Allow feelings of love for Alexandar to flit across your mind. Let the Sallow Man feel them.*
*Ask Slane who chained him here and purged his Source.*
Another Dreamer awaits there: Bahara. She is a far greater Dreamer than this Stingtail. She can take you further through the realm of dreams, for much further you must go.
*Say that you haven&apos;t.*
People seem to like that sort of thing. An&apos; I&apos;m done playin&apos; wiv&apos; it. G&apos;bye and g&apos;luck to you.
*Shake her hand, tell her your name, and peer closely at her. Lohse - don&apos;t you know that name from somewhere?*
*Show her the invitation. You came at Lohar&apos;s behest.*
Vanquish the Voidwoken.
Tell me: How have you enjoyed combat so far?
No-o-o-o, I wanna play hide and seek! HIDE. AND. SEEK!
You are determined to stay in trouble, I see. Come on. Your cell awaits.
Told you!
I need aid.
You were most... unusual.
*Stretch out to touch her reaching hand.*
Delete Save File
LOHSE! HE&apos;S BEHIND YOU!
I&apos;m sure you only meant that in jest. So yes, I will recite something for a little cheaper, &lt;i&gt;luronta&lt;/i&gt;.
I can tell a lot from a little taste. The carnage on this beach &lt;i&gt;nearly &lt;/i&gt;speaks for itself, but... still. One can&apos;t be too careful.
Stygian Axe
Later, pet. Consider me not taking it further my thanks.
*Say that in that case, you&apos;ll leave it be.*
Traitor! Swine! I will turn this dream into a nightmare from which your treacherous soul will never escape!
You&apos;re fine as long as you don&apos;t go wandering.
Hold on, my darlings! I&apos;m coming!
*But the Eternals are back - your people are home! Rivellon will be at peace, it will be paradise again.*
Soul Consumption
Search the garden for clues.
Radeka told us that this place is a mass grave from the time of Braccus Rex. Her two companions died here thanks to the traps hidden amongst the skeletal remains.
That Magister is still drawing breath... just about.
*There&apos;s a slot in the centre of the button - it looks like something should be placed in it.*
Mordus?
*His cruel, scraping, booming laughter echoes away inside your mind. You realise that he&apos;s laughing at your imminent death.*
It&apos;s your lucky day. Be on your way. But don&apos;t cross me again, or you regret it.
Return to Cat the Appraiser.
*Give the girl the cold, hard facts: She&apos;s dead. There&apos;s nothing confusing about it.*
The young woman is dead. In a way, she is cured.
The Crypt of the Divine
*Ask him what more he can tell you about the cave where Mordus is likely to have fled.*
*Tell the Magister they killed the wrong man - the chef was the real murderer.*
*Your blessing leaves you as a stream, and returns to you as a river. You see through the woman&apos;s eyes. You feel the discomfort of a Source collar as you tug at it.*
How dare you? Someone! Thief!
Earth Essence
Micheil Ros
Lizard mystics adorn themselves with the claws and teeth of slain predators, thereby channelling the spirit of the hunt.
It must make you terribly jealous. People with tongues, I mean.
Back for its hatchling?
*The shark glides and turns, sleek and free.*
Not today, lass. There&apos;s some fight left in us yet.
Iron Dagger
The spores grieve - they wish only to create, not kill.
A lot of violence around here lately. Don&apos;t suppose you can tell me anything about it.
There in the harbour! The Kraken!
I hope we did the right thing, overthrowing the Magisters.
Let&apos;s keep moving. I want to get out of this bloody place as soon as possible.
Return to me, the one who watches over you...
*Tell him you expect the time of your life.*
Heh. Ya said that so sober- like I almost believ... oh. Yer as serious as a boil on me bum, ain&apos;t ya?
Prong
I can only hope it will be a town of opulence and plenitude - despite its rather discouraging name.
Changes Incarnate&apos;s element to cursed electricity, unlocking Electric Discharge and Closed Circuit.
Twit.
Then you already know what you have to do. Get to Arx, and keep that Deathfog from swallowin&apos; the city.
*The ghost stares down at his broken, twisted body, a look of glum resignation on his face.*
You have a daunting task ahead of you. But I might be able to help stoke your embers.
*Stand tall and inform the demon you have no intention of fulfilling the pact.*
I think you can quite easily imagine what went on in that wagon.
*Ifan looks &lt;i&gt;anxious&lt;/i&gt;, an unfamiliar look on the Lone Wolf. Stepping closer, he whispers urgently in your ear.*
Covered Bed
*Look through his inventory.*
For you, a pittance. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82])
Ah, so you&apos;re on our side! Conway &apos;n&apos; I don&apos;t believe anyone ought to be locked up for who they are. Least of all someone like Hannag. I&apos;m so grateful you helped her - and us!
*Sidle back to her. Take her into your arms, into your heart, into your very being...*
*Say this is all very unusual. Should the Seekers regret letting him stay on the Lady Vengeance?*
I&apos;m pecking the SEED, I&apos;m pecking the DIRT, but I STILL CAN&apos;T TASTE ANYTHING!
*Ask him if he needs a hand.*
*This gives her pause...*
What would Lucian think, if he saw the Divine Order tearing itself apart?
[NOBLE] *Look down your nose imperiously: &lt;i&gt;&apos;The landlord.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
One sack for all your clubs.
Confront Tarquin.
Dragon Roar
*Eye the lizard suspiciously. What &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;is he talking about?*
Worn-Out Necklace
*Nod along. You&apos;re happy to let them take over.*
*A hatch creaks open...*
I&apos;m on duty. Don&apos;t bother me.
Assassinate the Advocate.
*A spin, a flick, a tickle and the eighth tumbler falls. You&apos;re beginning to think you know what it likes.*
Nooooooooooooooooo!
*Tell Roost that&apos;s impossible. You saw Alexandar die with your own eyes. &lt;i&gt;Twice.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask her to think about all you&apos;ve been through together. You&apos;ve done your best by her, when you could, even if you didn&apos;t always succeed.*
Get away from me, you lying scum!
Black Ring Vanguard
The Void is nearly here. You need to go the Well of Ascension and absorb the Source of the Seven. &lt;i&gt;All &lt;/i&gt;of it.
What.
I must say this wasn&apos;t how I envisioned our time together when you invited me, but in all fairness this has probably been one of the best nights of my life. Your company and a glass of amazing wine, what more does a man need?
[IFAN] *Look away. You know how this little scene plays out. It&apos;s not pretty.*
[1] increases all Poison and Earth damage you deal, and any Physical Armour restoration you cause.
*Act confused and say you were never fitted with a collar.*
The Cup of Kings
My destiny is finally fulfilled! Feast upon every soul that touched this armour, and the Devourer&apos;s strength will suffuse you!
Epidemic Of Fire Scroll
Broken Lever
*Help them drink their potions.*
It recognised us, alright. And it creeps me out.
[SOLDIER] *Talk about the most recent threat, and how the Magisters have been fighting the Voidwoken all over Rivellon.*
*Tell her she&apos;s being pessimistic. This time they can take the Magisters by surprise!*
Well, it looks like you have a few of your own talents to share! The old gags are such delights, aren&apos;t they?
The bride&apos;s a good friend of mine, lass. Got this invitation right here, you see.
The Gods demanded I sacrifice my Source that they may survive. We did battle even as the Council crashed down around us.
*The fisherman scowls and mutters, clearly uninterested in conversation.*
Speak to Gareth at Amadia&apos;s sanctuary.
Cr...urggh...
*RUFF! RUFF! RUFF!*
*Tattoo the name &lt;i&gt;Roost&lt;/i&gt; upon your right arm.*
*Toss your head free of Kinnet&apos;s memories; you have no time for this.*
Curious, I was sure I would burst into flames if I ever uttered those words. Oh well.
Oh goodie! You&apos;re a good human. Yes you are! Who&apos;s a good human, then? You! That&apos;s who!
*Stay silent for the moment.*
Oh! Oh, didn&apos;t see you there. Sorry; it&apos;s been, erm, quite a day. You need a hand with anything, let me know
Move a candle into the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;poison&lt;/font&gt; surface or set it on &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/font&gt; to blow up the door.
Greetin&apos;s, child. You must be v-e-e-e-ry far from your homelands indeed. Hurts t&apos;be so far from yer loved ones, ey? I know the feelin&apos;.
Maybe. But I&apos;ll keep doing it anyway, for what it&apos;s worth. We didn&apos;t judge Karon. That was a mistake.
*Before you go, ask what exactly she did to your sight.*
*Clear your throat and holler &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar!&apos; &lt;/i&gt;to get his attention.*
My dear friend, what do you take me for?
What little evidence we found points to the Cathedral. Kemm lost patience and called off the search. He&apos;s gone to the Cathedral to uncover the truth.
Shackled
*The tree-form spirit gives a low, slow, anguished roar of pain.*
I&apos;ll DESTROY you! I&apos;ll drink your blood! I&apos;ll - I&apos;ll - RAUUUGGHHHHH!
You know. Elves. Dwarves. Lizards. &lt;i&gt;Undesirables&lt;/i&gt;. Those of &apos;em that&apos;d see the whole realm eaten up by the Voidwoken &apos;fore they&apos;d change their ways.

*Lohse, the dark-eyed jokester you met aboard the ship, waves enthusiastically and dips into a mock-elegant curtsey.*

&apos;Here lies Idwal Rince.&lt;br&gt;To a life of adventure lived,&lt;br&gt;A death beyond adventure rewarded.&apos;
The Silver Claw&apos;s blade has clearly dulled. But you - you look like a woman of action. A doer of deeds. And I have a matter of some urgency I&apos;d ask you to... attend to.

*Arhu pauses, then relents.*
*The healer is too tired to even muster a scornful expression.*
Ah. Very glad indeed.
*Ask him if he has anything further to say.*
Isla. My Isla. Such a pretty little fool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though she&apos;s not wholly blameless in her family&apos;s downfall. She&apos;d have said yes to any chump wielding a ring and a smile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But since that chump is me, I&apos;ll be availing myself of her father&apos;s familial inheritance... which she&apos;ll be inheriting a LOT sooner than my father-in-law&apos;s doctor would expect...
*Ask if &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;could help somehow.*
Dead Rabbit
Demon schmemon; we&apos;ll make short work of her... eventually.
*Leave Han be.*
You... you released me, lizard... long have I waited for this moment...
*Say you have a helmet that will purge the Shriekers. You are ready.*
Or what?! What will you do? Lohse is mine. There&apos;s no cell in her body I do not occupy; no thought I do not see. I am everywhere, Lohse. Do you hear that?! I am everywhere, because I am &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
Spare me, Gareth. We got what we came for. This is what success looks like.
