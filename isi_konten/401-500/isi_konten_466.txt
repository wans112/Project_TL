*Take your leave. You&apos;ve had enough of this self-serving opportunist.*
Ready for round five?
*Ask him if it hurt to see his liver being clawed apart.*
*The cloying miasma within the glass shimmers and a face comes into view - a well-dressed dwarven woman, peering closely at you. With a hiss she closes the mirror and is gone.*
Stand back there!
That object doesn&apos;t fit in a container!
Don&apos;t worry - he&apos;s well under control. He&apos;s made a fine servant - isn&apos;t that right, ingrate? I used him to find the Aeteran. When we&apos;re done, I&apos;ll release him from his duty and free him from his pain. Until then...
*Say that you were glad to help.*
Abilities
They reside in a vault, hidden on a beach to the north-east. I wish my direction were more precise, but this place was designed not to be found.
Xantezza works by the light of the Moon.
You, Sebille, the elven Divine.
...Very well then. Since you lack the blinding aura of a Divine, or the sense of purpose of one that is soon to be, I assume you still haven&apos;t mastered the secrets of the Source.
You don&apos;t understand! You can&apos;t o&apos;en the chest. If you do, things&apos;ll go &apos;ang. &apos;oo&apos;. Things&apos;ll ex&apos;lode, is what I &apos;ean to say.
Okay, let&apos;s see what this &apos;master&apos; wants...
You here alone?
All those Sourcerers. Taken. I almost feel sorry for them.
Bridgekeeper Mari Pruitt
[BEAST] *Tell the creature your name. You are the Beast, and royal dwarven blood runs through your veins.*
she never wanted for help,
If you won&apos;t pay, you can&apos;t stay.
I could just eat you &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;.
We are who we are. I have returned the Eternals to the world, and the God King with them. Justice is done.
Huh?
Well yes, in terms of behaviour this is probably a lower standard than that to which I would normally aspire.
*Say you&apos;re quite certain it was him, and express your sympathies.*
[Arena_AvailablePlayer_2_f3cb5f2b-c0ca-4b36-b671-dd64d481f45d]
Good lookin&apos; out, Bishop.
[SEBILLE] *He&apos;s trying the Melvinian pin? Your training taught you how to get free of this. Dig your left elbow into his ribs to distract him, then fling your head back into his nose.*
Aeromancer Guardian
*Hand to hand is for chumps. Smirk and draw your weapon with your free hand.*
Who knows how long it will take to fix this mess.
Ah, the strong, silent type. I wouldn&apos;t imagine that twit Borris was able to squeeze much out of you?
I&apos;ve given you what you&apos;ve asked. I will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; let you subject me to the God King&apos;s whims. &lt;i&gt;No more!&lt;/i&gt;
Little gnat. You bite at us no longer!
Fulton&apos;s a Sourcerer. I don&apos;t care about that - I love him. But too many people from where we come from &lt;i&gt;would &lt;/i&gt;care.
*The woman traces glyphs in the air and you cringe, expecting a barrage of ice and fire. Instead, a bit of smoke sputters forth. She cries to the skies in frustration in a recognisable rail-thin rasp.*
Ksst! &lt;i&gt;Fyr-a las!&lt;/i&gt; I am sorry, dear one, but you must &lt;i&gt;go!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ve heard stories of Driftwood. My kind ain&apos;t exactly thriving here.
*He raises an eyebrow.*
Urgh, fine. But you can&apos;t blame a soul for being cautious - you didn&apos;t see what it was like. There was blood and bodies everywhere...
Demon... host... Godwoken. The Void comes for you...
&lt;i&gt;Discipline of Body.&lt;/i&gt;
Lohar was in way over his head. Deathfog&apos;s nothin&apos; to mess with.
Chance to block
*Tell her divinity suits her.*
Pain_Sh_1
*Her eyes stare vacantly into the distance, glassy as marbles. It&apos;s not cold, yet her shivering is relentless.*
Aye, we are at that.
*No, let the squirrel stay by your side.*
As for you, though...
Result
Ah, yes. The servant returns. What say you, peon?
*Ask again about the motivations behind the coup against the Magisters.*
Rivet Gloves
[JESTER] *Ask if... you know... when it does its... business... does the... uh... business... stick to its fur.*
This interesting crossbow is made of myriad pieces of wood fashioned together with tiny metal clasps. It looks like the work of someone who tried to fit a little piece of every tree in a forest into one object.
*The spirit of a woman in strange armour stands before you. Visible on her breastplate is the seal of Rhalic. She casts an imperious eye over you.*
...no more.
They will walk the same path as you, but they cannot be allowed to reach its end. You must be the one. Only one can wield the power needed to stop the Void. Only &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
We are not afraid of being the villain to your supposed &apos;hero&apos;. We&apos;re not nice, Lohse. We&apos;re just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The dreamer Bahara took me into a nightmare to meet Brahmos, another dreamer.
I still can&apos;t believe they had the gall to attack me. It&apos;s high treason to go after a Paladin like that. We&apos;re Divine Order, godsdamnit! Our superiors will be &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;interested to hear this.
&apos;Here rests Gawain Rince, fitfully.&lt;br&gt;Son of Idwal, brother to Gwydian.&lt;br&gt;Undeservedly loved, unreservedly condemned.&lt;br&gt;May the Seven withhold their grace.&apos;
Stunning Necklace
*Say you&apos;d like to discuss recent revelations about her being the Prime Scion...*
Hello. Goodbye.
*An ancient grave marker. The name upon it has faded away.*
It was my father&apos;s technique - he was the finest painter of his generation, and he used his own blood for his masterwork - the final panel of &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian.&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit of a Black Ring witch flails and writhes on the floor, engulfed by ghostly flames. An unseen force hauls her backwards, as if to bring her to safety...*
Self-Made Club
When we asked Lohar where he&apos;s keeping our stuff, he told us to get lost.
cone
*She draws close. You feel her breath on your neck. Hot. Moist.*
Karon was - is - a potent foe. He took to the sky as if on wings of pure Source. I might think a wyvern were attacking, had I not seen for myself his raging eyes.
Thank you. This- this is a gift. Please, let me give you one too.
*Say that first you want to know how she died.*
*Tell her the interrogation&apos;s over, on Dallis&apos; orders.*
I&apos;m really not well.
*Ask her if she ever wishes she could just be alone in her own head.*
Don&apos;t go walking into danger without the right protection.
It&apos;s about time! Let&apos;s go.
*tttck*
*It&apos;s no use. Your words do not seem to reach her.*
Well. If it isn&apos;t my better side. I hope we made the right decision. In the long run, mercy can be very... costly.
The store&apos;s open. Do your &lt;i&gt;shopping&lt;/i&gt;.
Drawbridge Wheel
*Suggest she get in the pool.*
He has told me his plan. Lucian will not wash our sins away with water or fire, but with Deathfog. The true faithful will bathe in the fog of their own accord, and he will reward them with eternal bliss.
Constitution
Not according to this. Besides, they weren&apos;t Sourcerers.
Well then you&apos;ll know where the hatch is. It hasn&apos;t moved.
Jahan... But the demon... The demon... Too powerful... Possessed...
From the quantity of dried blood upon the handle, this weapon appears to have seen more than one battle in the none-too-distant past.
I do not know what comes next for you, but you will always have a friend in the forest.
I know your crime, killer!
Laced Scale Pants
Use &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Resurrection Scrolls&lt;/font&gt; to bring back the dead.
You came into my house, bub. Not the other way around.
*Growl that there&apos;s no point in negotiating with a demon - you&apos;re going to expel it from the girl through force.*
The Doctor is dead. A blight on the world has been removed.
Just so. Some of these are quite dark, twisted individuals. The kinds of creatures that grew bored pulling the legs from spiders and so moved on to people.
*Ricks raises his sword, which shakes to the rhythm of his trembling hand.*

The merchant&apos;s burden you see: he must escort his merchandise, always.
He&apos;s... he&apos;s here. He&apos;s come for me. You must finish it, Godwoken. You cannot stop, you cannot -
I&apos;m smarter than you think, vandal. And you can think about that while rotting in a prison cell!
A-&lt;i&gt;lly&lt;/i&gt;... A-&lt;i&gt;lly&lt;/i&gt;... A-&lt;i&gt;lly&lt;/i&gt;... You may be right. And blood does not lie.
*Ask him why he has brought you here.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without helping the children to find their friend.
I shared Divinity with the world. Source for everyone!
*Sadha&apos;s ghost recoils at the sight of you.*
And yet here I am.

After you, milord.
Keep pestering me an&apos; I&apos;ll show you what I can do with my gutting knife.

*You sense an opportunity. He has the captain&apos;s confidence?*
*Turn away.*
I would never fall for such rubbish. Do you take me for a fool?
We can talk of this later, Marcus. For now, I have but one ambition: to strike down that manipulative &lt;i&gt;witch. &lt;/i&gt;
Looks like we&apos;re at the end of the line...
Drowned and eaten by a Voidwoken. I wonder in which order.
Divide and conquer: those damnable beasts almost managed it. We must remain vigilant!
There shall be a new Divine, and she shall be a kin... There shall be a new Divine, and she shall be a kin... There shall be a new Divine, and she shall be a kin..
*Look around at the bleak surroundings and ask what she makes of the place.*
Lohse...
*Lohse sings to herself, a small smile about her lips.*
*Thank him for the directions.*
&lt;i&gt;My!&lt;/i&gt; And there I was, starting to think you&apos;d forgotten about me, darling...
Still, hone your skills, and one day you may just qualify for a position in a lesser household than mine. You keep dreaming, you hear!
*His face contorts with agony and his eyes flutter, yet he doesn&apos;t return to consciousness.*
*...you can find your way over and around the accursed surfaces, those deadly stains that rise from the gods know what, deep underground. You have the power. &lt;i&gt;You have what it takes.*&lt;/i&gt;
Stay away from me, bully!
Greetin&apos;s, child. I find meself in your so-called Divine Lands, yet I feel his absence deep in my heart all th&apos; same...
He looks ready to flee to the heavens. But even the Hall isn&apos;t safe from the Void...
*Nod deeply, heavy with satisfaction. You are her own, you are her own.*
The answer is &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;. Now leave me to my work.
Griff would kill a fellow over petty theft. Giving up Stingtail is no better than murder.
Aye. &lt;i&gt;&apos;A change is as good as a rest&apos; &lt;/i&gt;- that&apos;s what Mother Melati used to tell me.
White-hot embers blast from the Summer Kingdom of Caldia directly into this blazing, enchanted orb.
*If she can decide fates with dice, ask if she can read the future in cow entrails as well.*
What a crumbling disaster...
*The flames dance before you, their eerie light slightly brighter than before.*
Vampiric Voidwoken
Poor Peeper, gone Peeper, baby Peeper...
This town could still be flooded with Voidwoken. We don&apos;t need more bait drawing them here.
&apos;It&apos;s a cat-has-trophy.&apos; Cat-has-trophy. Catastrophe. It&apos;s a catastrophe.
We could liberate Amyro by killing Griff. Many in the Fort would be relieved.
*Say that you might know, but you have some questions first.*
The fate of the world depends on our ability to research a spell to protect Rivellon.
We&apos;ll strap yer corpse with stones. You&apos;ll sink and be forgot..
