We&apos;ll find Micheil Ros at his daughter&apos;s wedding. He may be able to help us stop the Queen&apos;s Deathfog plot.
You just make the wrong move. There&apos;s a place for thieves like you: a prison cell.
G... git yer ugly mug outta here!
*The memory vanishes, burned away by heat. Ash falls from the sky as a growling whisper addresses you.*
*His countenance becomes stern and reproachful.*
*The spirit of the elven woman continues to hold her vigil. A dark, brooding expression envelopes her ghostly features.*
We found the tablet. It may be valuable. We can give it to Ryker... or keep it for ourselves.
&lt;i&gt;Tschhhhh&lt;/i&gt;. Good thing I didn&apos;t bother cleaning my blade yet...
Divine light. But... how?
She&apos;s downstairs. And, and... and now I&apos;m different.
[SEBILLE] *Order the lizard to turn around. You&apos;re looking for a Dreamer called Stingtail: does he know a kinsman by that name?*
I hope this brings the discussion to an end.  I don&apos;t like being roused from slumber, only to be greeted with such banality.
Antiquated
&lt;i&gt;tell me who you are dead one&lt;/i&gt;
Primordial Fire Voidling
*The bird ruffles its patchy coat of feathers, glaring at you with beady eyes.*
*A horrified fisherman stares at the water, muttering to himself. He looks up at your approach.*
*Say you aren&apos;t any sort of criminal, but that you hope the real one is caught soon!*
Victory! We&apos;ve got another tale to tell, my friend.
*Sigh* Some things never change.
*Tell her the Shriekers have been destroyed. That should level the playing field.*
They hatched and they fed - they &lt;i&gt;devoured &lt;/i&gt;us.
Lohse. Lohse! Is it you...?
*Tell him you&apos;d very much like to go downstairs.*
*...a curved quill made from a swan feather. Its barbs are as soft as a kitten&apos;s fur.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve learned how to make the potion she requires.*
Such barbarism... what happened here...?
And why do you deserve one, friend?
Lure of the Eight-Legged Wonder
You mistake me for a fool?
*She snorts and tosses a grenade from palm to palm with ease.*
Connection Type
*Fold the mirror away.*
You&apos;re a disgrace to Godwoken - get away from me you foul creature!
*Tell him things are looking grim for the rebels. Justinia&apos;s planning something big.*
Countess Squirreduke&apos;s Acorn Wine
On the bottle is written &apos;Acquillah O&apos;Rorke&apos;. But what does the potion do, one wonders?
*Say of course you&apos;re not straw - why would you be?*
We deciphered an ancient cult symbol; it was a mark of trials for followers of the Devourer and the Outlaw Empress. This path should lead us to a test.
&lt;i&gt;Do&lt;/i&gt; enjoy yourself in the crypts. For the both of us!
Good men died to bring it down.
There are reports Magisters have been hauling mysterious, ancient artefacts from the ground.
And here and there, across the world, what was left of the Black Ring fought on.
And you proved yourself against my little challenge. So now, we will fight, you and I.
I&apos;ve always preferred to be the one reaping the attention. But you&apos;ve turned the tables. I suppose it&apos;s only right, seeing as how a new Divinity may stand before me.
&apos;The chains bind their captive.&apos;
I - I&apos;m so sorry. I didn&apos;t want to hurt you - I didn&apos;t want to hurt anyone. But he made me. That voice - he made me.
Pestilence is the rogue for you. Good thing you&apos;re paying for his company - I wouldn&apos;t turn my back on him otherwise...
*Gareth taps his foot impatiently.*
The Voidwoken showed up pretty quick thereafter...
I think we should find out what it is.
A short history on various attempts to mute Sourcerers.
Reflect melee damage inflicted to you, but less chance to hit. (Toggle Stance)
Hang on.
*You see the rage in the Djinn&apos;s eyes fade a little. He flexes his claws as he thinks over what you&apos;ve said.*
From what I gather you&apos;ve a certain... illicit quality about you. You&apos;re the kind that doesn&apos;t shy away from violence, but in fact welcomes it. There can be no doubt that would place you in...
My, my, lobster! How very presumptuous of you to ask anything of me. I hear all kinds of rumours, you know. I know who you are.
You switched to another deck in your Hotbar. You can switch back and forth with [IE_UIHotBarPrev] or [IE_UIHotBarNext].
The store is open. Do your business, and be on your way.
Crippling a Demon
*Squints* Oh hey, you&apos;re right. You look just like an elf what had a run-in with boss last week. But now that I think of it, she was got rid of that same day. Never mind.
The doors are open. You may use them.
*Demand that she tells you where the others are! If she&apos;s survived, surely they have too?*
Beast&apos;s loyalty to his people remains. He intends to fight me for Divinity.
But I&apos;ll tell you, it comes in handy if you&apos;re dining with someone who really needs to lose their life. And soon.
Do not let your wounds fester.
*The statue reaches toward the sky, as though preparing to take flight.*
Volumes upon volumes. I can&apos;t imagine the vastness of knowledge recorded here.
*Ask him to tell you more about Doctor Daeva.*
Trigger Spores
A fine trophy to commemorate the slaughter of an innocent beast.
You&apos;ve more flesh on your bones than our last visitors. Who are you?
Up! Working or heave you out, we!
Find out how to be pure.
Poisoned Potato
*Say that Kemm is dead.*
Dark the Warlock
Only you know the truth. You and one other - for the God King still called your name. Did you answer?
*Tell her the truth: You met him on the beach, but he had been transformed into something not altogether human. He attacked you and died as a result.*
*The door is still unmarked, though the memory of the face - and its six-sided notch - remains with you.*
Necrofire Infusion Scroll
I&apos;ve something I need to tell you.
*The voice and vision disappear, but a cold presence lingers nearby. An invisible gaze weighs upon you.*
*This is going nowhere. Opt to kill him and be done with it.*
*Sigh* It&apos;s come begging, Quercus. After ignoring us on the boat.
I greet my friends. I greet acquaintances, guards, shopkeepers, forest creatures that cross my   path - the list goes on.
*Prod her to carry on. You&apos;re enjoying the performance.*
City Guard Sourceress
They&apos;re dead! Well, &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;dead...
*Nods.* Fair enough. I guess I&apos;ll see you outside, or I&apos;ll see you in hell.
Add Folder
Let&apos;s crank up the tempo!
I always thought lizards would be cool, but you&apos;re so boring!
Can you fetch some carrots for... oh, wait. Sorry. I thought you were someone else.
No, my king... another chance - please!
Fight Theme Drums
*Cheep* *Squeak*
The connection to the server has timed out
*Admit that you often long to escape the tangle of others&apos; memories in favour of ones of your own making.*
*Say that if you&apos;re to become a Master of the Source, surely there&apos;s no better tutor than him.*
No gold? Out in the cold.
Cart Tunnel
My queen... gone. I should have known not to put my trust in a mere animal. If there&apos;s any solace in her death, it&apos;s that I might again see her in the Hall of Echoes.&lt;br&gt;
*The agony of her final moments tortures her still.*
Matchmaking found [1] available lobby.
Or, indeed, you could stand there gawping as if I&apos;d just run off with your femur. You might not have brains any more, but I pray you&apos;ve managed to keep some wits.
What in Lucian&apos;s name...  I should&apos;ve known there&apos;d be trouble!
*She jerks her arm away from you and gazes lovingly at the welts. She doesn&apos;t look up as she speaks.*
I came to the Council to learn to be Divine. I failed. I am not made to be pursued by evil - and that&apos;s what it means to be Godwoken. Afterwards I roamed the island, as did all we fallen knights.
*A simpering dwarf and a blubbering lunatic. Roll your eyes and take your leave.*
What?! You bloody lying cur! I hope this cavern buries you alive!
Don&apos;t have much time for standin&apos; around. Get buyin&apos;, or get movin.
Heh. You come here pretendin&apos; to be all nice-like after you&apos;ve already cosied up with another.
Well... kind of. You know about my... erm... situation, right?
Lizard Sword
Ah, well. Give it some time. He&apos;s a good, good lad.
*She waits a moment.*
Attack_Melee_Crit_1
You&apos;re a good sort, aren&apos;t you. We need more of your type around here.
We&apos;ll discuss this later. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me.
I&apos;d never do such a thing. Never.
Dominating Statue of Braccus Rex
Oh, Ifan. Your reputation surely precedes you. Do you suppose you pass through this land unnoticed?
Godwoken. You&apos;re late. The world bleeds while you dawdle.
What was that? Voidwoken? I swear I heard something...
So this is it... the Arena of the One.
*Thank her. You&apos;ll do just that.*
Big Drudanae Pipe
Do you think me as soft-brained as one of your elf children? I know what you are. I smell it on your breath. You &lt;i&gt;reek &lt;/i&gt;of Source.
Dead Magister Ranger
*Bristle at the suggestion. Is that a threat?*
*The dwarf keeps her face tucked away. A muffled whimper escapes, and nothing more.*
*The spirit raises its brows and flits its eyes to and fro before settling them on you.*
Climbable Stones
Talisman of the Faithful
[SOLDIER] *Salute and tell him you were proud to serve alongside him too. &lt;i&gt;Damned &lt;/i&gt;proud.*
*Shake your head. Say that she gave you a&lt;i&gt; very &lt;/i&gt;generous discount.*
Leather Trousers
Survival and strategy go hand in hand. You should realise that by now.
Vengeance III
Garvan&apos;s supplies were destroyed.
Cook it. Cut it. Eat it. Love it.
A thief &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a liar. Time to do the world a favour.
*Ask who&apos;s in charge of this place.*
Not a single member of the Order lifted a finger to save our consulate. To think the House of War stood by Lucian&apos;s side during the Great War. Never again.
*What?! You&apos;ve never been so insulted. Pull on the last of your clothing and storm away.*
*Say you still have a few things to attend to.*
[OUTLAW] *Tell him you&apos;re on his side: a friend to chaos, murder and mayhem.*
*The door falls silent.*
A gift to Rivellon from one of the elemental monarchs of the Realm of Faery. Talented craftsmen call it the shock that brings life to runes...
*&apos;Our seventh&apos;s brood spread from earth to glen, and thus no King shall rise again.&apos;*
You speak the spell with brash ferocity, like I knew you would, Sebille.
And then there&apos;s the question that makes me shiver most of all: would we still be ourselves? Would I remain Sebille, or would my mortal soul die upon gaining divine immortality?
Blazing Sculpture
UI Radial Left
We remain vulnerable while at anchor. Better to make for the open ocean at first convenience, don&apos;t you think?
Report to our officer at the barracks. He&apos;ll be glad to hear there are still some brave souls in this pothole of a town.
Your lies do not work on me, thief.
*Promise not to hurt her.*
We will rejoin our comrades.
Is she gone...?
*The squirrel throws his hands up in indignity, but you can see a quiet smile spreading underneath his whiskers.*
Change Name
*Demand that the chest open before a citizen of the Ancient Empire.*
Empty? Who gives a goblin&apos;s arse! The point&apos;s to get back the supplies inside. Come on - noggin first, eh?
[MYSTIC] *Ignore the question. Say you can tell her fortune if she gives you a discount.*
The Voidwoken tore down the consulate&apos;s barricades like they were paper. I pray that Zorl-Stissa keeps the Empire safe from the Void, my kin.&lt;br&gt;
*Ask what he learned from observing you.*
