*Xhaxh&apos;s Source flows out of the jar, across your bones, and into your skull. For a brief moment you glimpse the universe, and then it&apos;s gone. You&apos;re left panting, filled with incredible power.*
You are already formidable, my chosen, but you underestimate just how much more formidable you could be!
You didn&apos;t never see him without a book in his hand. Always reading about some ancient race. He weren&apos;t the sharin&apos; kind, but he found something good in there.
You won&apos;t take me alive!
Don&apos;t go closer! DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
We thank you for the water. We bless you for the water. We ask you for the fare.
Arx - Outskirts
*The spectral Magister raises his sword and shield against an unseen Voidwoken foe...*
I&apos;m not offended by yeh, Beast, no matter how foul that name feels to my lips. Jus&apos; disappointed. How do you not know the price our people paid after your hasty &apos;revolution&apos;?
*A look of rage floods the spirit&apos;s face. He opens his mouth to say something, but it&apos;s too late for words...*
*The Magister struggles to her feet and, after a quick nod of appreciation, runs back toward her camp.*
There are some types -  deceitful types - that don&apos;t deserve to be among a place of such... treasure. He doesn&apos;t appreciate what the dead can do for us, my friend.
Magic resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
With Lucian in power, Saheila took the elves away from the world. They grew strong once more, amidst the trees of the re-grown home forest. Only the new Mother kept Saheila&apos;s plans for revenge from fruition.
*Be grateful that you don&apos;t feel the need.*
But I want to explain, I do.

We left the Sallow Man behind us, his fate unknown.
*The death-shocked spirit stares off into the distance.*
I am not a fool, you know. Help!
*The door opens and a tall, beautiful woman stalks into the room. She&apos;s flanked by heavily armed guards. You can&apos;t make out her words, but see the fear in the dwarf&apos;s eyes.*
They can&apos;t even be healed; using such magic on them would kill them now. Such beautiful souls, corrupted by such evil...
*Something stings your palm, an invisible claw pressing into your skin. Elemental essence materializes in your hand.*
Close your eyes, Lohse. Do as I do.
Note that a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;poison surface&lt;/font&gt; has been created in your vicinity. You can burn it away with fire, or wait until enemies are inside to blow it up!
*Lean close to his ear and whisper &apos;thanks for your stuff&apos;.*
Sleeping_2
*Brace yourself. There&apos;s no telling what this crazed woman might do.*
*A skeletal arm reaches upward, grasping at empty air.*
*Lean in curiously. Is &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;where they harnessed the power of the Veil?*
*Take a moment to catch your breath after everything that just happened.*
[NOBLE] *Say that prisoner or not, you won&apos;t be spoken to like that by some common footsoldier.*
Your people and nations come and go - mayflies screaming their importance at a universe that cannot listen.

*Tell her you&apos;d heard she was responsible for the destruction of Paradise Downs.*
And then there was you.
Trickery! You&apos;ve riled the beast. And the only cure for the affliction... is &lt;i&gt;blood.&lt;/i&gt;
Well duh. I&apos;m sure that disguise will fool most people, but I&apos;m a &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;sensitive and discerning soul.
Oh...? Oh! Well... yes, perhaps you&apos;re right...
*Tell him it sounds deeply suspicious.*

I&apos;ve got one job: guarding. And I&apos;m damn good at it.
Knockdown makes target unable to move or act.
AGGHH! What are you doing? Get off me!
Do as you will, mortal. Give Dallis your Source. I shall not stand in your way. In a world without Source I shall still rule. My name strikes fear in the hearts of the world - and &lt;b&gt;fear is power enough!&lt;/b&gt;
This didn&apos;t please the Emperor&apos;s advisor Ghol, however. Ghol didn&apos;t want Rezha cured, for he planned to inherit the Empire. So he convinced the Emperor that someone like Zin had the power to both cure &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; kill. On his advice, Rezha had the doctor executed.

*Nod. You&apos;re in this together, no matter what.*
*A memory returns - a sacrifice at an altar on the island. The god smiles... and seems to grow.*
*Thank him for his time, then leave.*
*She sleeps deeply, her breathing soft and regular, the hint of a smile on her lips.*
And as for the blood and guts and bones and heart... they don&apos;t feel like mine. It&apos;s taking everything from me. A little more every day.
What are you waiting for? The experience of a lifetime awaits upstairs, and the door to you is open.
*He smiles a crooked smile, and runs a hand through his greasy hair.*
Give the hens the untainted egg.
*The spirit floats before you, staring dreamily at nothing. It opens its mouth to speak, but you can&apos;t hear any words.*
Turtle Johnny
Radeka gave us a recipe for a powerful potion that requires three blood roses to craft.
Amadouvier Seedling
*Lohse looks at you mildly, her eyes blank.*
The Voidwoken spoke to us - they seemed to recognise us personally, calling us vermin. What could it all mean?
Silent Watcher
*Say that he&apos;ll have to wait here for a moment.*
Your impertinence runs deep, Paladin. So too shall my blade.
Don&apos;t you dare to be ungrateful after all I&apos;ve done for you! I sheltered you; now you must shelter me!
*Summon your powers to your fingertips and bless him.*
*Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;wolves&apos; and &apos;sawdust&apos;.*
We refused to kill the flame and condemn some poor soul to oblivion. Malady was incensed.
Skull-Marked Key
The Red Prince did not find a dreamer in Driftwood. Perhaps he shall have more luck on the Nameless Isle.
We should&apos;ve stayed. There&apos;s so much more we could have done to weaken the demon!
Well. If you&apos;re truly sorry, I overlook it this one time. But don&apos;t let it happen again.
*As you approach, your guise glows hot, unbearably hot, upon your skin.*
Steel Ruler
You speak the spell with brash ferocity, as I knew you would, my child.
*Aside from a single blink, Gareth stands remarkably still.*
Wh- what are you doing? No - stay back! Get away from me!
Nothing happened. Something must be wrong on the other side.
*Cough!*
*Hold back.*
I know you wanted to impress me... and that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;adorable&lt;/i&gt;. How about this? I&apos;ll let you know a little secret so you can be more like me.
*The dwarf lazily opens an eye, glances at you, and shuts it again.*
The tree must fall. The tree must fall.
Fancy Gloves
*Say you understand. She&apos;s done the best she could.*
My husband&apos;s actions were his own. I &lt;i&gt;do not &lt;/i&gt;condone them.
Dispatch the Silent Monks.
*Of course, you say. You&apos;d like to meet this kin, and the price is reasonable.*
I seek vengeance. Against the King. And against the Seven.
*Say that you found Magister Brannt, but he must have succumbed to his wounds.*
Beryl Griff asked us to help reclaim the schoolhouse.
A Pile of Rocks
Cursed Fireball
Who? Anyone, my child. &lt;i&gt;Anyone &lt;/i&gt;could be a threat.
Dismiss from Party
You think you can poach my contract? You should know better, old boy. This whole place is a trap... and you&apos;ve just sprung it.
With what gold? Your purse is too light for a wager. But perhaps heavy enough to trade?
Well?!
What is yet unborn will one day spawn an empire. We must protect them, my love!

Divine Order Bulletin
*Ask why Lucian would have banned Godwoken from entering the crypt.*
The archives...? Parchment. Books. Writings about the evil things we uncovered. That knowledge didn&apos;t save us in the end.
*His Most Esteemed Majesty Braccus Rex.*
*Nod along. What do you need to do?*
Feh! Fend for yourself then, twiddle toes. I&apos;ll take what I want after the Reds get to you, anyway.
*Gently call out to her and ask if she&apos;s alright.*
*Accuse him of lax security. That cake from the Doctor was filled with dangerous toys!*
Bye bye, love. Tell &apos;em I say hello when you make it out. They&apos;ll be looking for me. Tell them.
Magister Letter
Some of the best minds in Rivellon couldn&apos;t help this girl... and you think you can do better than they did?
The first Passion of Lucian. A genuine Hubert Oak masterpiece!
You&apos;re gonna be the death of us. You hear?
Cancels effects of Mask of the Shapeshifter
*Ask what happened - how did they die?*
Such daring, Sebille. Such &lt;i&gt;strength&lt;/i&gt;. The hunt would be nothing without you - but let it wait. Rest here for a while, with me.
*Meistr Siva&apos;s stare bores into your soul. It is still, analytical, and ice cold.*

I get sack of meat every day to watch cave - and not answer questions about cave. Island keeps me strong - stronger than other trolls. Go now, or there will be pummelling.
What fresh hell is this? Something&apos;s pounding on the hull!
*Ask who he is.*
I was... somewhere else. I think I talked to it. You know... &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;. It was a real piece of work. Gave me a pretty incredible power, though.
*Wonder what the letters say.*

[SCHOLAR] *Suggest that, preferring drier climes, yarrow is likely to grow on the sunny cliffs above this beach.*

Consume a corpse to gain a Source Point, or steal a Source Point from a living character.
*He looks to the suspicious bulbs surrounding the chest. Then back to you. He knows he&apos;s caught out... his lip quivers... wobbles... then he starts crying.*
Anyway. Enough chit-chat. I do have a contract to be fulfilling. The same Godwoken contract &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; couldn&apos;t hack even one piece of.
Profile &apos;[1]&apos; cannot be deleted because it is currently in use.
