A trustworthy saviour and samaritan to those in need, you are beloved by many.
*Not every detail is visible through the terrarium&apos;s hazed glass, but there&apos;s no missing the plant&apos;s trumpet-like blooms, perfect for catching raindrops - or insects, perhaps.*
The entry mechanism of the inner chamber is missing a piece.
*Ask if she&apos;s feeling all right.*
Once there - well, perhaps you should keep walking on that course? Hold your breath and surely you will overcome the Deathfog&apos;s miasma.
&lt;i&gt;You&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;the one that&apos;s foolsih. &lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;a fantasy. &lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;a big dummy!
Why would they want &lt;i&gt;you? &lt;/i&gt;You think the gods have any use for a two-bit singer with a parade of unpredictables marching through her head?
*Mordus tries to raise his remaining arm to his head, splaying his fingers wide, but the digits are viciously snapped off by some unseen force.*
[MYSTIC] *You can feel a dark power clouding these minds. Focus your abilities and try to drive it away.*
&lt;i&gt;*Creak...* &lt;/i&gt;You. Must. Leave. &lt;i&gt;*Creak...* &lt;/i&gt;You. Can. Not. Win. This. Fight.
[MYSTIC] *Stare in shock. There was a demon in the helm? You never felt its presence.*
Beyond the blood hides nothing but a desire to be happy. I can only hope that is not too terrible a crime.
I should meet Brahmos in person, that he may tell me about &lt;i&gt;her,&lt;/i&gt; the red kin woman from my dreams.
And they say romance is dead. Well, darling, let&apos;s not waste time. Find your desire within the gem.
We killed Sister Schori.
Deerhide Armour
*In a flash, Beast has become them both - brother and sister. His feminine side is a rebel, rising up against the tyrannical Queen. His masculine side is a royalist, loyal to the monarch he loves.*
I put an end to Gareth&apos;s torment as a Silent Monk. In a cruel twist of fate, he had once again served Lucian the Divine in his final moments.
I&apos;d think it plain by now who I seek and why. Like all of the God King&apos;s apostles, Kemm creates havoc not just in this plane, but many others.
Vrogir
I can&apos;t stay. You shouldn&apos;t, either. What did Lucian say? Ah, yes. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Evil feasts on the indolent.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; Get yourself to safety, and soon. You&apos;ll always have a place at the Seekers&apos; table.
This streaks moving objects. Disable this if you don&apos;t like the effect. Disabling this does not yield a whole lot of a performance boost.
And to think, the tavern trusted an elf in their kitchens? It was only a matter of time before someone ended up in the pot...
*The dwarf is silent for a moment, his head held high as he appraises you.*
It seems inconceivable to me now, but in my blackest hour, I turned to him for guidance...
Worm Tremor Scroll
*As you remove the lid, a fresh wind fills the room. For a moment you think you smell pine, and then the power rushes inside you. You can feel Source coursing through your veins.*
*He slurps something round and white into his mouth, thoughtfully chews for a moment, then spits it on the ground, where it lands with a sickly splat. He wipes his mouth and looks up at you... and Ifan.*
Maximum Magic Armour increased.
Truth is, kind sir, that we are not, in fact, cows. At least, not as such.
We&apos;ve nothing left to say to one another. Just leave me be!
The guepinia is used in some of the spiciest meals in Rivellon. Flamebelly Curry, Volcanic Pork, and Burnin&apos; Custard all owe their intense flavours to it, but guepinia is also used by brewmasters specialising in magical resistances. Needless to say, it helps protect against fire.
You&apos;re up to no good! Open up your pack, now!
*Nod and ask to cross the bridge.*
I&apos;m warning you! The second I think they&apos;re on to me. The &lt;i&gt;second!&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
Poor, stupid, selfish girl. If not for me you&apos;d still be a two-bit singer with a few coins in your pocket and someone else&apos;s songs in your head.
Outside the ruins of Zorl-Stissa&apos;s temple, we learned the cult of the Devourer was driven into hiding. There are two more armour pieces away from the Nameless Isle: one owned by a man named Kemm, and the other protected by an enclave of lizards.
*Interject. Ask what is happening here.*
Paladin Johnne Hurrey
*You&apos;re keen to get out of here. How does he think that&apos;ll happen?*
Another... another of my Magisters is gone. It can&apos;t have been that bloody tinkerer - the culprit&apos;s still out there...
Ah, &apos;tis done then. Now don&apos;t you go squanderin&apos; yer talents. You got a chance to change folks with a couple of strums.
Locket
They were spice merchants, killed by bandits as we were trading on the forest roads. The elves nearby saved me afterwards... they found me hiding in a wagon and... and they took me in.
Yarrow Flower Growth
*Ask to hear the ode.*
[NOBLE] *Say you don&apos;t make rounds; you have them made for you.*
How dare you VIOLATE ME!
*Say you&apos;re sorry; you want her to stay.*
I&apos;d hoped you&apos;d say that.
A party member chose the Lone Wolf Talent. The maximum party size has been decreased by one.
Leadership means marking your territory. Now we know who the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; leader around here is.
Hold it right there! Just &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;was that? Have you made no effort at all on developing your constitution? You&apos;re about as charming as a dog with worms!&lt;br&gt;
Leadership
So... &lt;i&gt;ngh&lt;/i&gt;... it starts...
Perhaps... we may at least be reunited in the Hall.
A word of warning to you, Red Prince, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait  - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
*He goes deathly pale.*
*Say if he&apos;s done carrying on, you need him to answer some questions.*
*Fan yourself. He&apos;s hotter naked than he is clothed.*
Summon a Bone Smasher
[IFAN] *Nod and walk away with your head down. If they realise who you are, you&apos;ll win yourself a trip to the top of their list of suspects - collar or no.*
*You&apos;re confused. You don&apos;t want him to go: &lt;i&gt;&apos;What happened?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Let the creature eat. Time will tell what the reward it promises might be.*
As a born Fighter, I prefer the perfection of the blade myself, but I&apos;m well acquainted with the secrets of magic and, yes, even subterfuge. What say you?
*Ask if he&apos;s heard anything about the culprit.*
This arrow is sure to slow your foes in their tracks as well as put a spring in your step.
Butcher&apos;s Blade
*She twirls in place, then stands straight, arms at her sides - still smiling.*
Ain&apos;t that the way of it? Well, dream or no, can&apos;t say I feel &lt;i&gt;awake&lt;/i&gt;.
Only Magisters and corpses have business here. &lt;i&gt;Leave&lt;/i&gt;, while you can still draw breath.
Feedback
You&apos;ve come to serve, yes? Excellent. Bring me my *snorf* slippers. Chop chop!
*You see, or rather you &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt;, a far-off land. Frozen breath hangs in the air, pine needles brush your cheeks, and in your arms you can feel a weight. A body. Dead, but you have hope...*
[OUTLAW] *Say that you have a nose for those with secret agendas. It&apos;s something of a professional requirement for you, in fact.*
Why do you do this? So rude to just vanish mid-conversation!
*Her endearing smile just about melts your heart.*
*Say that you can&apos;t allow that to happen.*
*Ask her what&apos;s happening.*
*Squeakie*
*Wonder about that &lt;i&gt;&apos;little errand&apos; &lt;/i&gt;he mentioned; who exactly is Ifan here to kill?*
Look... me and mine, we move... classified cargo. Take it right off Magister ships and put it into the hands of those that&apos;ll use it rightly.
I agree. This place is... is horrible. Let&apos;s go, Malady.
We ventured on, leaving the matter unresolved.
[SCHOLAR] *Gasp. A cursed helm! And in pristine condition too - what a find!*
Mod Update
*A scruffy kid bounds up and stands before you, hands on hips. He stares up at your face, doubt screwing up his features.*
Mysterious Room
Behold the lizards&apos; noble, graceful carriage...
*Wonder aloud if you&apos;re not on something of a loser here.*
The cave was our base, where we wrecked, smuggled, and stored the loot.
*Demand to know who you&apos;re speaking to.*
Hullo. Hey, have you got my ball?
Expensive Necklace
I just wanna go home...
*The bombardment stops. The image of you as Divine hangs between you. And then... the spirit smiles.*
*Say that Scions seem quite important to them. What is a Scion, exactly?*
Unlocks Battering Ram and an additional ability (depending on summon). Increases Physical Armour by [1] and damage by [2]%.
Kemm has left the Magister barracks. Whether he found what he was looking for remains unknown.
Decomposing Hunter
You rebuffed the kiss. There is no second chance, darling.
Cinnamon
Harmony Magic Armour
Plate
*Tell her you&apos;re very proud of her.*
We entered the maze and the gargoyle revealed to us that the skulls are old and rare.
*The final dial clicks.*
On Magicks Faire And Foul
That... isn&apos;t good.
Can it? Sometimes I think this realm of ours is cursed. You look alive, O Divine One. I&apos;ll bet this place keeps you on your toes.
Throw Item
*Gareth forcefully exhales and looks past you to the nearby house. You fear he might snap the shovel&apos;s handle in two.*
That... was disgusting. Yet now I have that oily power within &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. Worth it? Worth it.
Shadow Sniper
Kenna, the Persistent One
Elemental Arrowheads
Half our number fell to Shriekers, but none have risen again. The God King must be displeased with us - &lt;i&gt;we have to take that temple!&lt;/i&gt;
*Lie. Of course you are.*
Have your bows notched and swords ready. There could be Voidwoken nearby - or more Seekers.
Shoes of Doom
*His icy eyes focus on you for the first time, pinning you with a freezing look.*
Indeed, I have made notes on many of the major events in your life and I believe personally observed many more. In fact-
*The spirit slips away.*
Enjoy the city, won&apos;t you. Arx is wonderful at this time of year.
Just stand aside, why don&apos;tcha, mate. This is no business of yours.
*Her darkened eyes scour her body with an uncanny intensity.*
Don&apos;t let it get to you. We&apos;ll set it right one way or another.
Fight Theme 06 Oud
A worrying thought, but we must hope for the best.
You! You have been summoned. Go, do your duty. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
If you have proof of anything, seek out Magister Carver. But if you lie to us, you&apos;ll be filleted on the docks, and left with all the other rotten scales.
Secret Magister Document
[JESTER] *Palm a coin and reach behind his ear. Produce the coin with a flourish, and bow.*
*No response is forthcoming, but the hand presses harder, urging you on.*
But what about everyone else, Trice? We can&apos;t just leave &apos;em to die! Please, mister. Can&apos;t you do something?
A lot of violence here. Tell me what you know about it!
I do not defile the dead.
Source Hound Argos
These &apos;Purging Wands&apos; are the key to our escape - we have to find some, then return to Gratiana.
No harm in such a view so long as it brings results! And speaking of results... here, take these...
*Smile. Tell her you&apos;re so grateful to be free.*
Open
*This is their problem - take your leave.*
*As the Dreamer&apos;s Source flows into your veins, you feel the eyes of a massive beast upon you, hungry and awake.*
*Tell her you can&apos;t - you just can&apos;t.*
*Step away. You still have a few matters to consider.*
[OUTLAW] *Maybe you could get a nice price for this if it were a little cleaner. Spit and rub off some of the dirt.*
We&apos;re not out of the woods yet; there are more on the lower level! Aim for the archers!
*Whimper...*
