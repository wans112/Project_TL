We won&apos;t let that happen, will we? I&apos;ve got a little something cooking. There&apos;s power in names, after all, and we know exactly who Adramahlihk is.
*Ask why she was going to be executed.*
But once I&apos;m sure the way&apos;s clear, I&apos;m running to Arx like a cat with its tail on fire. I&apos;m done with this stinking town.
SON AGAINST FATHER:&lt;br&gt;DEATH IN THE ELFLANDS&lt;br&gt;A DRAMATIC RETELLING OF TRUE EVENTS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LUCIAN the DIVINE and his adopted son DAMIAN stand, square-shouldered, before each other, alike not in visage but in determination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DAMIAN: And what have you been to me, these years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LUCIAN: I am your father. It was I who saved you, I who loved you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DAMIAN: Love! You denied me everything I am. My true nature. The woman I loved. You would have seen me clean-cheeked, clinging, castrated if it meant I&apos;d cause you no trouble. I am no Alexandar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LUCIAN: My boy. Your words bite into me and vipers. Please. Say no more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DAMIAN: You made me silent all my life. I&apos;ll stay silent no more!

Slaughter Saheila.
I hear there are some nice beaches in Rivellon, though. Fort Joy is probably lovely this time of year.
It&apos;s free to look, just don&apos;t touch nothing unless you&apos;re going to make my purse jingle.
Perhaps you should see him, dear. Something is clearly ailing you!
*He looks away, refusing to meet your eyes.*
*Look around you, lean in, and ask if it would be safer to let him go. The dunes are probably crawling with Voidwoken...*
This is a black day. This is a day of death.
Heh. No indeed, girl. But &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;ain&apos;t my final destination.

Somehow, aeons ago, we withered. We shrank, our wings shrivelled; nevermore to be the majestic creatures we once were.
Place Marker
Of course, not everyone on the ship&apos;s manifest has returned, as you can see...
There are few such choices. Consider other options as well.

The Red Prince didn&apos;t survive the escape to the Hall of Echoes. He is a spirit now, lost forever.
Mmm. Mommy.
Look, I know you&apos;re him. I know you can take care of problems. And I&apos;ve got &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;the problem for you. A very lucrative one...
Go on and run back to your cave, why don&apos;t you.
Go on - go on! Put it out!
Who is to say? Could any curse be more grave than this interminable conversation?
The Advocate is dead.
*Say that you&apos;re glad he got off the ship safely.*

*Say there&apos;s something you&apos;d like to discuss.*
If you fail at this now, we&apos;ll go no further. You&apos;ll have proven you don&apos;t have what it takes; you&apos;ll have given him the key to destroying you - and who knows how many more.

This is no time for pranks, my friend. The doctor&apos;s arrogance may end us all. He has released a dark presence upon us. &lt;i&gt;It must never sing the Taming;&lt;/i&gt; the hymnals must be destroyed!
Tell Mumsy to come back soon! Now that I am but bone, I&apos;m too light to trrrip the moving doorrr. I&apos;m surrre therrre&apos;s a rrrat back therrre...
Do. But I&apos;ll be watching.
*The dwarf subtly tries to wave you away, hissing at you from the side of his mouth.*
*The deer&apos;s breathing is laboured, its mouth moving in vain. You lean in close and it whispers &apos;run...&apos;*

It was my birthright! They promised me greatness and then cast me aside like a used rag. So I looked elsewhere.
