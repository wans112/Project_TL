*The Paladin watches the forest with an easy stare, her bow held loose and ready.*
Silver Glass
*Agree to help.*
Boom
A duel? Ha! Where do think you are, snake-face? Palace grounds? But if it&apos;s a good guttin&apos; you&apos;re looking for, I&apos;ll be glad to shiv another lizard!
The Academy
*Shrug; nothing&apos;s going to bring her back.*
*Change your tone. Say you&apos;re here to listen.*
*His insincere smile freezes in place.*
Spirit of Seim
You take me for a child! You have-
Yeah, yeah, I know. I&apos;m working on it. Okay?
It thinks we are sitting here, twiddling our paws, Quercus! Perhaps we haven&apos;t succeeded yet, but we have other worries.
I guess I should&apos;ve stayed. I know that. But I just... I &lt;i&gt;couldn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;i&gt;The House of Shadows stirs...&lt;/i&gt;
There can be great goodness in doing exactly nothing. Remember this.
*Give her a beatific smile as you turn away.*
*The bark is covered in a scratchy, scrawled handwriting. It&apos;s hard to read, but you can just about make out the recipe for a spell.*
The log rewarded us with a shield of livewood bark.
I&apos;m inclined to agree. You managed to catch me off guard, after all.
Huh. I want another beer and a bowl of stew. Which of us is more likely to get what they want, d&apos;you think?
You need to go, Godwoken. But I have one last request. My last wish as it were...
Higba
*Say you are very unsatisfied.*
Say &apos;bye bye&apos; now.
Well, look what I find. Looks like you spend some time in prison!
*The rat glances nervously at your teeth.*
[BEAST] *Tell him you hail from the kingdom of the dwarves, though you haven&apos;t been back in a very long time.*
*He cringes and clasps his hands together in a desperate display of contrition.*
Oh! Lohar! I know the guy, alright. I knew his father, Kiss-my-arse, and his mother, Shove-off!
Change Folder Name
[UNDEAD] *Tell her you&apos;ve had enough tea. It just seems to... go right through you, so to speak.*
So that&apos;s the way of it, is it? Let&apos;s get this done!
What? You have uncovered Braccus&apos;s hoard? Tell me, did you find anything else? That vault contains relics - Soul Jars. Did you see them? Do you have them?!
Kitchen Pot
Oh, what is it.
*Lie and shoot him a wild grin. They sure are!*
WE RISE...
Walk to me... Walk with purpose... I am near...
*Draw your weapon and prepare to defend yourself against this unseen attacker.*
*Ask for an unreasonable sum.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
Adept Metamorph
*Shout out to Fane - he can&apos;t! Not after everything you&apos;ve been through together.*
I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve ever given them much thought. They&apos;re no more than an elven curiosity as far as I&apos;m concerned, obsessed with the idea of becoming sentient bark.
Tell me...
*Tell him it couldn&apos;t be helped; she got in the way.*
*Repeat your offer: Would he like some help?*
*Say you think the new Divine will try their best.*
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Attention, Reds!&apos;&lt;/i&gt; It&apos;s Alexandar&apos;s voice, and you stand at attention. The Bishop is to speak of the newly created Seeker division. Perhaps the two of you will be chosen, should Lucian will it!*
But not lost to Fane. Fane would never forget.
*Ask him to switch to a classic.*
It is not enough to be Godwoken in order to ascend to Divinity. There is a process...
*Say that you have some questions, before you leave.*
*Remark that losing the ring isn&apos;t such a big problem then.*
[IFAN] *Without a word, let her know that you will not be doing any weeping.*
Carefully explore the cavern.

So? Anything interesting for me?
Human Pillar
I see the truth behind your lie. I see your lonely path.
A simple cup, slightly rusted and stained with wine.
A word of warning to you, Red Prince, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
Of course - of course...
Oh goodie! Thank you thank you thank you thank you!
Quick Wolf
*His eyes open, but he doesn&apos;t see you.*
Besides, I was just about to tell you where your Master is. Just like that.
I&apos;m glad you could come. You seem to have traversed the Deathfog just fine. So tell me, what ails you?
*Rattle the doorknob.*
Crispin
*Groan in frustration. You suppose it&apos;s easy to carry nothing of value when you have no customers.*
*Sensing a good opportunity, you say you&apos;d like to help her find the culprit.*

*Malady suddenly grabs Lohse&apos;s arm. She speaks through gritted teeth.*
Hell&apos;s teeth, it feels good to breathe mortal air again! I can smell your putrid lives... your &lt;i&gt;unlife,&lt;/i&gt; or my senses deceive me. An undead. How interesting. How &lt;i&gt;delicious...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Sssshhhhh.&lt;/i&gt; Now&apos;s not a time to alert enemy ears.
*Ask if she knows who she is now.*
*He barely seems to notice your repeated question at first. His eyes are dark pools in which your reflection is drowning.*
*Ask if any of these doodads they found included a tablet of some kind.*
This is going to be messy.
United, we are a force to be reckoned with, but if we are to survive the onslaught of the King and his Void minions, you must remember what you have forgotten. We must become &lt;i&gt;vastly&lt;/i&gt; more powerful.
Decide what to do with Ryker&apos;s tablet.
These are the banners of the House of War. My house.

But I hear the Queen is at it again - and there’s something darker behind her madcap schemes this time. If I don’t stop her, I don’t know who will.
Keep that up, and I make you pay!
*The undead cat arches its back and &lt;i&gt;hisses &lt;/i&gt;aggressively at your presence.*
You! Gil, is that right? I&apos;ve a few questions for you.
I name you doom bringer! I shall feast on your bones. The God King shall have his justice.
But do be careful not to get caught. I was their - *cough* - guest for a time, and I promise you, the gallows was the most comfortable part of the experience.
Well done. &lt;i&gt;Very &lt;/i&gt;well done.
Cow Die
Of course I am real, dear boy. As are you, it seems.
Report back to Jahan.
You fool! Do you understand what&apos;s been done&lt;i&gt;? &lt;/i&gt;The Mistake - repeated! You must contain him. Return him. &lt;i&gt;Destroy him. &lt;/i&gt;

Delay your turn
My end stop is Arx. The Queen&apos;s got Deathfog on the brain. What she plans to do with it, I don&apos;t rightly know. But if that stuff leaks out in the city, the whole populace is good as dead. &apos;n once that happens, the Order&apos;ll be all up in dwarven business. And my people have suffered enough.
*MOO!*
Skin Graft Scroll
Alright. You may proceed. If Lord Arhu unlocks the door for you, you may enter. Just keep it short, he&apos;s preparing for his Lucian&apos;s Day speech and won&apos;t appreciate being disturbed.
*You can&apos;t get past the thought that &lt;i&gt;demons&lt;/i&gt; are out of their depth here. Demons. Out of their depth.*
Yes, yes, spend your last few minutes of life battling someone that&apos;s trying to read a book. What a splendid thought.
The Godwoken&apos;s sacrifice severed the bond between the Sworn and the God King.
What on earth is that noise?
Pine Tree
We found the Thieves&apos; Guild.
Have you no mercy?!
*Relax, and say you&apos;ve never heard of this &apos;Princess&apos; that the creature speaks of.*
*Two dwarven spirits, at loggerheads.*
*He inches his foot forward, frowns, then pulls it back.*
You betray your kin. You deserve what comes to you, Sebille Kaleran. Talk to me no more.
Intimidator

*Shake your head. You haven&apos;t found anyone worth sharing the road with.*
Small Sword
Who do you have in mind?
She will set her loved one free...
Off to prison with you. You have plenty of time to dwell on your crimes in there.
The gods? No. I want you to save the dwarven people. Greatest of the races, and most imperilled.
*Inform him that you found a bloodied ring hidden in the tavern kitchen - bearing the Magister seal.*
Good riddance to them.
*You don&apos;t need to hear anymore from this foul killer. It must die!*
Then there&apos;s nothing left to do but...
Very well, let&apos;s be off!
*The jar sits still. It seems to have revealed all the secrets it contains.*
*Hold out the coins and insist.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Hah. Well, this is the real me. I&apos;ve always been a host.
He rallied some veteran Magisters and Paladins to his cause, and brought us here. He knows what needs to be done now, to become the next Divine.
*The Magister steps forward with a smile and draws her weapon.*
*She rises from her bow, her face frozen in... fear, you presume? It isn&apos;t long, however, before she shakes her expression away and takes a defensive stance.*
You! Identify your-
Uninvited guests lurking about it seems...

Dwarven Stew
I&apos;m Jace. Jace Loke. It&apos;s good to meet you.
A diamond this large must have been stolen from a royal family or perhaps prised from the recesses of a deep, dark mine by a very lucky explorer.
*You see Stingtail cowering as Dallis walks past him by the beach. She smiles at him gently and says: &apos;All will be delivered. I will see to it.&apos;*
What voice is this that drifts through the marshes?
I ought to feed you to my hounds for this treachery...
*Power seeps out of the jar, a whispered promise of magic. But as soon as you feel it tingling on your bones, your Source collar locks tight around your neck, squeezing and crushing you.*
*Ifan freezes with resolve, and a cold anger emanates from him. In one fluid move, he steps close to her: knifepoint to throat. Without a flicker of fear on her face, she smirks arrogantly back at him.*
A friend. A Seeker. And a guardian. I attend the caged monster before you.
[LIZARD] *Tell the man you were close enough to watch them murder a kin in cold blood.*
*Both men remain stiff, as if bracing themselves against an unseen wind.*
So: How&apos;d they get you?
*Say that you&apos;re not through with him yet. You have more questions.*
Rise, my rotten army! Rise!
Oh well, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll soon gather your wits. Most likely. Eventually. In the meantime, all you need to know is that we&apos;re on route to Fort Joy.
I don&apos;t think the problem is in my head, and further to that I don&apos;t think the problem could be unscrambled by the use of Source.
I wouldn&apos;t trust these dwarves as far as I could throw them. Attack!
What the hell &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you?
I ceded Divinity to Lucian. May he do right by my people - and all of Rivellon.
Patience, my sweet. It would be remiss of me to not explain just what you&apos;re walking into...
*Confront Vredeman - that is, Braccus Rex. He sought divinity the entire time?*

Listen to your master, Sourcerer! And stop causing trouble!
