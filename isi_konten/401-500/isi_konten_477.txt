*Say you need to talk about the investigation into Dallis and the Magisters.*
*Shake your head and take your leave.*
Stow your weapons. It&apos;s best for everyone.
*Abolish the promise of the Hall of Echoes. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
I don&apos;t know about all the rest of them. It&apos;s Rhalic who called me, and Rhalic I&apos;ll follow.
*The soul jar explodes into a glimmering powder.*
*She pushes the door open, and with a jerk of her head motions you inside.*
*The Magister barely acknowledges this, his eyes flicking around the room as if waiting for an assassin to burst forth.*
Intestines
Don&apos;t be so naive! My doors only open on the occasion of truth. What you admit to them, you admit to me, redscale.
Bleed Fire Scroll
Display Case
Cream rises. I am the cream. They... were not.
*The Doctor flicks his wrist dismissively.*
That&apos;s quite a diversion you concoct there, but it doesn&apos;t work on me.
Ha! Of course you never found it. You always lacked imagination, &lt;i&gt;Lady &lt;/i&gt;Amadia. It was hidden in these very caves - beyond your wit.
*The creature turns to you. It&apos;s so hideously ugly it&apos;s almost beautiful. You feel like it&apos;s trying to grin, but the smile looks more like a snarl.*
Wouldn&apos;t know a thing about you and I, Griety...
I reached a new level of mastery over my Source powers, thanks to an undead dwarf named Mordus. My destiny draws closer.
My wife was loyal. She was loyal as they come. How did it end like this...
*His expression hardens. A dagger appears in his hand.*
*Tell him he wouldn&apos;t know respect if it cut off his tongue and shoved it down his throat.*
But you said - !
Oh! You gave me a fright, sneaking up like that!
Curse a surface
From his memories? You ate something off his corpse? Please - don&apos;t tamper with the evidence. Especially not like &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.
Goodbye, Sourcerers.
*Jump back - your mother didn&apos;t have scales!*
[Translate30_d242278c-207f-46e1-8e5a-f99cb2059ee6]
Stand off, stranger. Friend or foe?
If I knew then what I knew now, Marcus, I would still exile you. You would walk the Isle of Mists to this day, stalked by demons and living the nightmares they planted in you.
Thick Book
I would&apos;ve died without you. Thank you.
*This statue was once a living being. Perhaps it can be revived.*
Suicide
Thing is, I can never be free. I have taken their queen from them. So I must choose the dwarven people&apos;s liberty... in exchange for my own. I &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be Divine. And I can&apos;t allow you the chance to decide otherwise.
But some day, the Great Acorn will fall again, the forests will be reborn, and the giant races will be wiped from this world! ...Ahem. At least that&apos;s what I hear...
Find out what happened to Saheila.
No; it&apos;s not the oranges, but the &lt;i&gt;dreams &lt;/i&gt;he&apos;s after. Same as I, though I have the right. The responsibility.
[NOBLE] *You remember Lord Fenfaw had a device&lt;i&gt; just &lt;/i&gt;like this and bragged about it constantly. It didn&apos;t look too complicated. How hard could it be?*
Basket
What you lookin&apos; at? I&apos;m sick here. Get lost.
It is important you realise how high the stakes are.
Homeland is gone. Home is wherever my people are. My mother is amongst them. Tovah. A great elf. I do not mind Fort Joy, but I miss her very much.
*Say goodbye.*
Rest?
*Look at the lizard suspiciously. How could he possibly know that?*
Alright, fine. What happens next?
Search for the Second Passion of Lucian.
I bet they had it coming.
*Claim that you&apos;ve been tasked by the Arx authorities with checking that its citizens have adequate measures in place to prevent burglaries.*
*Stare at her in shock. What war? You didn&apos;t start any war!*
*Unleash your anger. What could he know of &apos;justice&apos;?*
*The warrior&apos;s face is grim and angry as his voice, except for his eyes. As you walk past, you notice a small stream of tears rolling down his cheek.*
...and on top of everything, someone seems to be &lt;i&gt;killing &lt;/i&gt;what few Godwoken there are. It must be Alexandar - a failed Godwoken like him wouldn&apos;t want to see any other become the next Divine.
*Wonder what his fellows would think if they knew he was looting from them during a moment of crisis.*
KNEEL! I AM THE LAST. I AM THE ONE. &lt;i&gt;YOU ARE NOTHING! &lt;/i&gt;
Not [1]&apos;s turn!
I thought this would be a slice of cake, to be quite honest.
We put Reaper&apos;s Coast and the Weaver behind us.
There is nothing to forgive. I know this happens. I see it. I do not stop it.
The &lt;i&gt;Divine&lt;/i&gt; cannot be asked such questions, Godwoken. Besides, I trusted him... he must have had his reasons. I just hope he&apos;ll forgive me for breaking the oath I swore.
Deals [1] to enemies and undead allies around you and can poison them. Turns water, blood surfaces and clouds into poison!
Isbeil. We must not...
Wits: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
I must say, I was hoping to enjoy a smug advantage over everyone else.
He should still be alive. Yet more blood on my hands.
We&apos;ve met before... yes, we know each other! Please - you must help me!
*Rogue.*
Cave - Broken Bridge
Oh, look here! You&apos;ll pay for this, thief...
I won&apos;t forget you either, Ifan. Good-bye.
The Hammer herself sent you, did she? Well, you&apos;ll just have to report back to her with the &apos;truth&apos;. &lt;i&gt;Why, this here Sourcerer died in a Voidwoken attack! Alas, there was nothing we could do...&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m nothing if not a man of my word. And I did give my word I&apos;d set &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; free, lass. Say your prayers while you&apos;ve breath to speak them. The Halls await...
But you removed your blindfold in the Arena! You failed my challenge... now I&apos;ll never taste my victory in your blood.
Malevolent Beholder
Ally with me, Red Prince. Find Sadha... and kill her. If she births dragons, all other races will unite against us. And this time, they will destroy us for good. We were &lt;i&gt;spared &lt;/i&gt;last time. The condition of our continued existence was that we&apos;d never let the dragon roar again.
I am - was - a lizard of opportunity. You think I should remain loyal to my house when Braccus Rex can turn me into a lesser being in the blink of an eye?
*Grin* I don&apos;t know anything about a crime!
You returned to the world as one more dwarf among many. Your future was yours to decide. Did you accept your new status with humility, or did you rebel?
Inert Wooden Wand
That so?
*The spirit of an elf makes a dash for freedom - only for something to seize him and throw him backwards like a ragdoll.*
*Windego&apos;s shattered form recoils as Kemm raises his hand.*
Kemm told us that the Magisters have betrayed the memory of Lucian. New evidence from Lord Arhu finally pushed the Paladins to act.
We decided to bring the little girl back to the Lady Vengeance. Perhaps it will be possible to banish the evil entity that lurks within her at a later stage.
We discovered that there may be a way to escape from this place through the Hall of Penitence.
*Groan*
Pulled from a Black Ring warg, this sword is notched and scarred with evidence of many battles fought.
Oh, I take my goods, alright. But you don&apos;t get a second chance.
Inconceivable! This is Eternal craftsmanship. I&apos;ve never held something so powerful...
*Maintain a staunch silence.*
What are you trying to prove?
Deal immense damage to a summoned creature.
A true warrior! You desire great strength. To you, an armed legion is merely a wall of flesh ready to have a path carved through it.
*&apos;It&apos;s so pretty!&apos; she says, resting her head against your shoulder. &apos;I don&apos;t care what they say - what you have is a gift.&apos;*
Foul creature.
A book of poems dedicated to pigs - or rather, a single pig called Lulabelle.
*Sigh. Justinia&apos;s in trouble. If you can talk to her, maybe she can see reason.*
Good women. Good men. Still fightin&apos; the good fight too, though most of &apos;em fled to the Hinterlands. The Wavedancer crew&apos;s probably gone to join &apos;em. No offence to you, but I miss &apos;em. Still, it&apos;s probably best I don&apos;t subject &apos;em to all... all this.
&apos;Faster!&apos; &apos;We&apos;re getting close!&apos; Easy for her to say. She might be called &apos;The Hammer&apos;, but I never saw &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; walloping away at the rocks.
*Remark on the uncertain future. What will she do now?*
I&apos;m sure we can give those drones a new song to sing...
*You realize this is an altar once used to initiate dwarven Death Heralds.*
You&apos;ve got a special... something, dwarf. Looking for a bit of magic in your life?
Oh, Rory. Ooooooh, Rorrrrrry.
Perhaps, but we cannot take that risk. If we let him slip away without following every lead then his next victim&apos;s on our heads.
Take care, chief.
*The urn throbs in time with your grief, but then turns cold as the Void. Even the urn cannot bring Peeper back from the darkness which claimed him.*
Listen to me. It is not too late to heed my warning! Should we become dragons, the other races will drive us into extinction.
We ventured on, leaving the ring behind.
*Lower your head in sadness. What was she thinking, allying with the God King?*
*Tell her you know about the crates. You know everything.*
*Step away from this cursed soul.*
Lucian&apos;s blessings, stranger.
*Leave them to it.*
Wind Deep Forest 05
We entered the Blackpits.
Container
*Fane nods grimly.*
*The object, and what lies inside, are in your hands.*
Goodbye! I&apos;d love to talk again.
Straw
And every dwarf could be a threat.
Focus on the living. They live because of you.
*Admit that he has a point. You&apos;ll let him live. But, you warn him, he&apos;d better not cross you again.*
*The freed dragon looks sick and pale. As you approach, he stretches his tattered wings weakly and fixes his intense gaze upon you. Frozen tears glint in his eyes.*
Now I&apos;m exiled and hunted by assassins, but I assure you: I remain undaunted - and as determined as ever to claim my rightful throne!
Beast
There are some sins I can&apos;t forgive. This desecration... this is one of them. I. Can. &lt;i&gt;Replace you!&lt;/i&gt;
Near the Stonegarden, we met the healer Gregorius Swann. He told us of his struggle to cure a patient of a terrible affliction.
*No point in letting Source go to waste. Consume the spirit of the dwarf. *
So did I, my child, but the Void slithers into everything. I told you before it is stronger than ever. But so are you.
Back? And what want?
Ha! Thank you.
Creates a cursed poison surface and deals [1].
*Insist. How much would he be willing to pay?*
When your party members have &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;exclamation marks&lt;/font&gt; above their heads, highlight them and press [IE_Interact].
Distinctive Trumpet of Death
*The Doctor whips his head toward you. Lohse remains eerily still. Her eyes are blank and witless, her soul snuffed out by the demon at her side.*
You whooped every soul in the arena, right? Twisted face-ripper or no, you - well, you could be the One.
An open door&apos;s as good as an invitation, eh?
*Say there is no more Divine. The Order&apos;s rules are those of petty men.*
*Tell her that Magister Harrick remembers the scent of cinnamon in here... even in death.*
Oh,&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;wouldn&apos;t... this one&apos;s not for eating.
Singed White Magister Meeting Notes
A perfect fit!
&apos;Goods bought &amp; sold - NO QUESTIONS ASKED.&apos;
Though I must say - I&apos;m surprised you haven&apos;t tried to kill me yet. After all, that&apos;s what Dorian is paying you for, yes?
*Wait silently, one eyebrow raised.*
Alexandar survived. He&apos;s locked up unconscious belowdecks on the Lady Vengeance.
