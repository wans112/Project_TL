*Avoid the question and take your leave.*
Get away from me, you.
*Say it&apos;s pretty rich to be on a break with Voidwoken prowling outside town.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
This dragon egg is warm to the touch... it must be almost ready to hatch.
*Ask him to remind you what he wants you to do.*
*Accuse him of cowardice. Was he planning to simply flee Arx rather than confront the queen?*
Ugh. Well that explains the smell...
*Say you have very serious matters in town. You don&apos;t have time to play egg hunt.*
A Brewer&apos;s Appendix
The Imprisoned Elf
Lohse...
[MYSTIC] *Offer that perhaps it&apos;s time to forge new gods.*
Maulrat
Powerful enough to restore our forests, perhaps. But the Magisters capture me before I can try.
*The imp spirit remains unhappy, and also quite dead.*
The Doctor&apos;s Fish
Eternal relics in the Blackpits - Fane&apos;s people were here, and here he may find answers.
[You&apos;ve rarely read anything quite as disgusting as this autopsy report. The doctor of record examined all aspects of a deceased human subject, including the length of her intestines, the exact length and width of various bones, and the elasticity of her ligaments and muscles.]
*Reach out to console the spirit.*
UI Right
Malady appeared with the Lady Vengeance and rescued me. We retreated to the Hall of Echoes.

Use a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;backpack&lt;/font&gt; to store grenades, arrows or potions. Place it in your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Hotbar&lt;/font&gt; to quickly access its contents.
*Laugh at him. His wife won&apos;t be impressed.*
Now, it will take more than Quercus&apos;s ferocity and my wit if you&apos;re going to survive. You need power. And I think I have just the thing.
My allegiance is my own.
Wouldn&apos;t say no. Fills the belly. But the other ones... so yummy. They taste like shadows and spoilt cream.
*He settles back to sleep.*
Excellent. You, my good lady, have earned a front-row seat to today&apos;s performance!
*Squeak!*
I know, I know. We got this covered.
Pag Vorr

Two heads&apos;re better than one, papa used t&apos;say, and he had three, so he&apos;d know! Hehe. You lookin&apos; for a travellin&apos; partner? Well - just so happens my beard&apos;s available, as long as the rest of me comes too.
*The elf shakes her head. Her face is a mask of determination.*
Fane. Darling Fane. I had to know. I had to be sure.
Lighting Quality:
*You don&apos;t know and you don&apos;t really care. It&apos;s not your responsibility anymore.*
[JESTER] *Tell her that the sugar plum fairy forbade you from sharing any of the secrets he taught you.*

Alexandar Divine? Could work.
*Xhaxh&apos;s whines blossom into roars.*
*Hand her the amulet you found on Gareth&apos;s body. He probably would have liked her to have it.*
A thief &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a con artist. Prison is where you belong.
Back, Magister!
*Unfortunately the Magister does not seem willing to part with it, no matter what Fane offers. The undead turns and storms away.*
&lt;i&gt;Please...&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;ve waited a long time for this - I need a real answer.
Be...
If you won&apos;t yield by your own will, &lt;i&gt;you will yield by mine. YIELD TO ME!&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit traces runes in the air. You recognise the gesture - it&apos;s the same one you perform when gifting others with your blessing.*
We must search Arx for Dallis, the Aeteran, and the stolen powers of the Seven. Divinity depends on it.
You have heard the dangers of the prophecy and yet Sadha lives, safe in dreams.
Rajjamira, a possessed Godwoken, is dead.
*Say that the Red Prince already lay with her. She&apos;ll soon be the mother of dragons.*
*He turns to you at last, those eyeless sockets staring into you, and as your senses crawl beneath your skin, you realise you know the truth already - you can do as he did...*
*The spirits watch Gareth in sadness as he rummages through the house.*
Maybe you should give it a bit of time. I imagine it takes almighty power a little while to settle in.
*Nod. Ask him where to begin.*
Of course, Your Majesty. Absolutely. The enemy doesn&apos;t rest, so neither should we.
*You take the job. Find the Scions. Destroy them. Wring them dry. Earn the fury. Earn your blood. Easy work.*
*Fane raises his head and responds in the same jolting, clicking tongue - he seems to be pleading with the creature, his hands outstretched.*
*Kneel down and examine the prone owl.*
I know I&apos;m fumblin&apos; along here. I know the ways of royalty and the ways of piracy, but I know shite about Divinity. All these people lookin&apos; to guide me, and I&apos;m still not sure how one... &lt;i&gt;divines, &lt;/i&gt;or whatever.
Not Ready
What?! There&apos;s a detachment of Magisters down there looking for him - &lt;i&gt;go tell them!&lt;/i&gt;
The Red Prince
*Explain that you&apos;ve always been attracted to dark places.*
Until I rip his body apart with my bare hands, I won&apos;t believe it.
*He sings. The scar song swells: a thousand tiny needles in Sebille&apos;s soul, chipping away at her will.*
Tutor
*Ask to have a closer look at the doll.*
Tomb of Vydia
Is that so? Then I&apos;d say death is the only proper punishment!
Egg, egg, egg. Egg, egg, egg.
*Under the collar you find the sharpened points of metal rivets, gouging the poor dog&apos;s skin. The dog bares its teeth at you and growls.*
I do not know what awaits. I do not see where the dark paths lead.
*Continue to watch the flower.*
Outsiders were often suspicious,
*He touches the tip of his finger to yours... your mind opens... and a secret of the air implants itself within you. He smiles...*
Divide and conquer: those damnable beasts almost managed it. We must remain vigilant!
P... passed?
*Perhaps she is not too far gone? Take her hand.*
Free the Winter Dragon.
Poison Cloud Arrow
Tub
Oh, but &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; forgive me. Allow me to bow in gratitude.
*You can&apos;t be fully sure he heard you. His attention stays upon the water and he whispers on...*
*A flash of the needle. This time he&apos;s not quick enough. With lightning speed Sebille spears his hand. He howls with pain.*
It&apos;s really been some adventure, so far, eh?
The Lady Vengeance is, after all, &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;ship. And now here we all are.
Giant Poison Demon
And here I thought myself so clever! Alas, Isbeil proved too unpredictable to fall into my trap. She is such a thorn in my side. Not to mention, in Queen Justinia&apos;s - and in yours.
I&apos;m glad you&apos;re of such a mind. I never was one for gore, myself. But never mind - I&apos;ve got the plan, and you&apos;ve got the brawn!
Tha&apos;s right, Your Highness. We&apos;re taking all your stuff. Any quarrel with that, you can take it up with Lohar.
Key? What key? Oh, the key! The Magister who took Emmie dropped it when he was walking away. Did someone say Emmie? *Whimper* Emmie...
See this uniform? That makes me and Tatcher here &lt;i&gt;Magisters. &lt;/i&gt;Not waiters. Get me? Good. Now, tell you what - to make up for your little social blunder, you can help us settle an argument.
*Flash the invitation you got from the drunkard, and claim you&apos;re a good friend of the bride.*
Help us, Fane...
*Snarl.*
*Lay your hand upon its neck.*
Those creatures seemed surprisingly coordinated... Oh, and we seem to be missing some of our party.
We found Eithne&apos;s remains in a tomb.
*Maintain steady, calming eye contact and nod in affirmation. Yes, she is dead.*
*Tell her that you&apos;ll be right back and take your leave.*
Cycle through targets with [IE_PrevObject] or [IE_NextObject].
The Red Prince escapes me yet. I shall hunt him from the shadows...
*Lie that a &lt;i&gt;Magister &lt;/i&gt;is a jolly person in red, but they&apos;re very smelly so the cub should stay away from them.*
It&apos;s quite expedient magic, actually. The ship is made of livewood - it has the spirit of an elven Ancestor Tree within it. It seems Dallis has found a way to bind that spirit to her.
Flee from the current combat to a Waypoint Shrine of your choice.
*Ask the spirit if all of the Magisters were killed.*
*A thought suddenly enters your mind, though you&apos;re quite certain it isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;yours.&lt;/i&gt; You hear the voice of Amadia in your head: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Do as she says.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Volumes upon volumes. A trove of history and knowledge.

Then I must endeavour to improve, madam.
Door to the Main Floor
Innocent child. You will see. You will see what &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;be done.
*Ask Fane what he&apos;s doing.*
I&apos;s ready, Got King! They came outta nowhere and killt us all! I&apos;s ready! Rise me up! Rise me!
Hard to say, at a glance.
Please. Don&apos;t make this harder than it has to be. It&apos;s not your fault, but you still stand in the way of peace. This must be the end of your journey. For the salvation of all Rivellon.
[SEBILLE] *Tell the Magisters that that doesn&apos;t matter - it looks like they need some professional help.*
Grenade Tremor
My mates outside are beyond help, and you&apos;re doing no-one any favours by calling attention to us in here!
Hotbar Lock
There is another way... though one that is supposed to be reserved for the Keeper of the Cathedral...
*He stops. Lets you come to him.*
Hold it right there! It&apos;s time to get you back into a cell, where you belong.
Honestly? Good things. At least a couple.
Vrogir
The vault has an inner chamber, but the entry mechanism is missing a piece. We should try to get it working.
But I do wonder: can a god be called a god still, if they have to plead with another to assume the powers they seem to have lost?
*Han stares at you for a moment.*
Weight determines how many items you can carry
Let&apos;s let the madman help us.

There&apos;s got to be a way! We&apos;ll save Ma. I &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;we will.
The Lady Vengeance
[UNDEAD] *Sniff and say that there&apos;s a big difference between Voidwoken and the Undead.*
He always kept a socket peeled for signs of the Eternals,
*Shake your head in sadness. What horrible sight has she seen to provoke such hatred?*
*Note that the surly tone in his voice seems a little... forced.*
Darling... To behold you in this naked glory is to surmount the boundaries of existence and step into a more perfect universe.
[UNDEAD] *Insist that freedom from undeath is easily sought - but not so easily obtained.*
You. The Red Demon. The exiled pig. I heard they&apos;d sent you here, but I&apos;d hoped you&apos;d have drowned yourself before crossing my path.
*Woof!*
*Wince and hesitantly offer your congratulations on her marriage.*
*Enter the safe combination.*
Oh, make no mistake. I&apos;m not asking you to support &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;at the Wellspring - just not to be beholden to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. To think for yourself. To make choices that you think are right - not what some half-dead God demands.
A Web of Desire
Switch trade window
Yes, it is my home. It is a home for all those who need one.
*Say you haven&apos;t made up your mind one way or another.*
Feared
*Ask what you should do next, if you were serious about ascending.*
[SWORN] *Say you serve only one - and it isn&apos;t her.*
*Kemm pretends not to hear you. He looms over Windego, a behemoth in contrast to her pathetic frame.*
*Tell her you&apos;re still waiting for someone...*
Farewell, lad!
If the squatters were gone... I could start fresh. Scour the place down, get the school going again. Get out from under Lady Kemm&apos;s posh thumb...
*Cough.* I pledge my heart, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my soul, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my life, O Lucian, please return.
