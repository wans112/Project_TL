If you see anything suspicious - anything at all - report it immediately, do you understand?
*Say that you know how to enter the Council.*
Psst! Hey, chief. I need to have a little chat with ol&apos; Mals about something. Mind if I butt in?
The experienced dwarven sea captain Beast joined me.
*Readdress the topic of the dream journey.*
That thing has nothing to do with me. It&apos;s just a visitor. A fly that won&apos;t buzz off.
New Sticky
Be safe. He could be lurking anywhere...
*Ask where this hoard of limbs might be.*
Together we are a force to be reckoned with. But! If we seek to survive the onslaught of the Void, we stand no chance unless we become &lt;i&gt;vastly&lt;/i&gt; more powerful than we are now.
And so many plants can be grown in this way! Try Amadouvier, Puffball, Drudanae...
*He laughs boisterously.*
Gotten good at recognising your kind. Someone&apos;s trading a lot of gold for the heads of Godwoken.
We&apos;re certainly missing a piece of this puzzle. Time to fill in the gaps.
Spirit of a Markswoman
[IFAN] *Tell her you&apos;re sorry: you have personal business with this one.*
*Remark that you are glad to be aboard. The Lady Vengeance has been a dependable ally.*
*Say that you&apos;ll gladly bring the message to him, if she were to let you pass...*
Move along. Move along.
Unnis? No! I&apos;ll protect you!
I&apos;m not really looking for a chat, if you get my meaning.

Braccus Rex: A Portrait Of Evil, Volume Seven
Don&apos;t be castin&apos; yer short shadow around here, mister. This here land&apos;s not fer your kind.
Let&apos;s head to the fort. We&apos;ll be safer there... I think.
*The masked creature is mute, save the occasional moan.*
celebrated wherever she went.
*He points the tip of his blade at the grisly sight of the elf hunched over, clutching his knees in the cage.*
*Tsk tsk* We got more mouths to feed than a fertile sparrow.
*They look puzzled, but the little boy seems to accept the idea.*
Jump to higher ground.
If you want to get to the God King, you go through Linder Kemm. You topple his tower of lies.
*The skeleton shrugs casually and returns to his book.*
Malady has concluded her own matters, and can be found aboard the Lady Vengeance.
Death walks among us!
Well ain&apos;t you just a pretty piece. Griff might&apos;ve told me, pacin&apos; this place like a damn fool searchin&apos; for what&apos;s already found! Why, I&apos;ve a right mind to...
Little Yarrow girl! Grown up, flower-headed girl...
Griff doesn&apos;t know a way out. We&apos;ll have to try someone else.
*Tell her to snuff the candles. It&apos;s the only way she&apos;ll weaken the demon enough to gain control of her own mind once more.*
He seemed... &lt;i&gt;resentful &lt;/i&gt;of late. Towards his position. Towards the whole Order. It was more than mere bitterness then... it was treason.&lt;br&gt;
I don&apos;t relish having killed these creatures, but it couldn&apos;t be helped.
Evening Gloves
*Sigh.* Nip. Nip. Neep!
Metal Grate
Take it and go, and if you say a word to Julian or anyone else, &lt;i&gt;expect trouble.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ifan folds his arms and pointedly ignores your attempts at communication.*
*...Black. As your eyes grow accustomed to the dark, you first notice a glint on your readied dagger, then the pale skin of your mark.*
So no. I&apos;m not convinced.
*Ask about the priestess&apos;s history. What brought her here?*
*The skeleton sighs and turns back to its card game as you walk away.*
PAPA.
This is it. We&apos;re so close, now.
You there, slave girl. A word!
You again, mister! I don&apos;t like it down here... don&apos;t like it at all...
*You are immobilized by fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of nothing. Fear of everything. It aches, as if the weight of the world presses against your skull.*
Pleading Letter to Sanguinia
Look inside, you&apos;ll find me there...
We met Windego, the murderer from our journey into Fort Joy, now caged by the Magisters. We put her out of everyone&apos;s misery.

Dungeon - Corridor C
*...moving to the rhythm of your desire, two beings for a moment become one...*
Fine. Be on your way.
*That&apos;s impossible! If you were truly a Scion, you would know it. You would feel it.*
Halfway to greatness; a little heat will take this poisoned meal to new heights.
Corpse Explosion Blood
*Admit that while the Empire&apos;s practice may be tradition, it is cruel by any definition.*
*The spirit&apos;s lips part, trying to form an answer...*
Have respect. I beg you!
&lt;i&gt;You shame us.&lt;/i&gt;

Thank you for trying, at least. We &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;appreciate your efforts.
We can see the things we lose. Not with our eyes, but with our hearts. This ruby does the trick.
Signpost
*The razor smiles unfurls upon his lips - and then he is gone.*

Human graves. Let&apos;s hope none are earmarked for me.
It would mean &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. The One will prove herself above all others.
It is carrion and aromatic herbs, carried on the wind as one. Surely you sense it.
Leader of the Pack
The pox on those bearded devils!
Gwydian... you&apos;re alive. Thank the Seven.
*Retort that he resurrected one of the vilest despots to ever walk upon this world - there&apos;s no excuses for being part of such an enterprise.*
I know you come for me again. I know you do. I know I only have to wait.
May my child reduce your foes to ashes!
[IFAN] *Your deepest self? Good. Say that lad&apos;s got quite some explaining to do.*
*He speaks through gritted teeth.*
Now go, and take this ring with you. It was taken from me, but I command this dream. By this ring I make thee one with fire, and one day, by this ring I&apos;ll thee wed.
*He moves to lick his haunches, and seems taken aback by his own translucence.*
A lesson worth learning, was it not?
*Ask if she knows who&apos;s responsible for this.*
Goblin Mystic
I&apos;ve had a feeling you might say something like that. We&apos;re no&apos; of a mind, are we. That much is clear enough.
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; do not get to make that decision. That decision is &lt;i&gt;mine!&lt;/i&gt; A good day? Let&apos;s talk about a good day.
Your failed rebellion against the Queen nearly destroyed you - so you began a new life on the high seas. Now, your old enemy is back. If you don&apos;t stop her, no-one will.

*Tell him no: you walk alone, as you always have.*

*The Red Prince addresses the lizard spirit. He turns out to be a Dreamer, long dead, who speaks archaically and sings in a truly ancient tongue.*
Reaper&apos;s Coast struggled on.
One may ask, one may inquire, but one should be eternally  wary of what one &apos;demands&apos;.
Search
I have to try - nothing ventured, nothing gained! Speaking of which...
...the reasons why we pause and pray.
Looks like we&apos;ll have to find some other way to keep you busy...
*Tell her it&apos;s... affection. Respect. And now, in this moment, an all-consuming desire to explore every inch of her body.*
*Keep still and bask in the kudos.*
*The dwarf&apos;s armour is painted in the colours of the Queen&apos;s court. It looks as if it weighs half a ton, yet he moves with alarming ease. You note his insignia - that of the Royal Guard, a snarling wolf.*
Looks like we&apos;ve unleashed some chaos. Well, a little more on top of the heap can&apos;t hurt!
I might regret this but... go on. But don&apos;t let me see you doing anything you shouldn&apos;t.
Inquisitor
*Bound in scrap metal, the weaponised travesty in front of you shivers and shudders, waiting for the whim of the White Magisters to direct its movements.*
*The judge smiles thinly.*
I guessed as much. Thieves belong in only one place: a grave.
Just like you, I presume... You didn&apos;t come by here by chance, did you? No... your power, your skill... you&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask if she sells anything more... useful?*
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you, Beast. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
U&apos;rak! Ksze-durek. Mirst... mirst haggyi...
*Ask Ifan what he&apos;ll do now.*
*The smoke burns your lungs, but you don&apos;t feel any different. Your vision slowly starts to clear.*
Something happened... I think.
I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t feel so well. Ungh, my stomach...!
*Pause. &lt;i&gt;That&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;what she wants to talk to you about?*
I think... he&apos;s going to die.
What in the name of Damian&apos;s demon-kissed &lt;i&gt;arse&lt;/i&gt; do you think you&apos;re doing?
Then, Malady the half-demon fell under suspicion... from both sides.

Plenty of souls will rest easier now that Ryker&apos;s dead. Not all - but plenty.
&lt;i&gt;*Growl...*&lt;/i&gt;
Hah. Then you&apos;re in the wrong hole. This place is split: our kind versus yours. You got the lizards and the dwarves on your side, we got the Divine on ours.
Grawwwwrrrrrrrr!
I&apos;m sorry, darling, but business is business.
*Frown. Why does she say that?*
Charlie is dead.
What&apos;s done is done. Or rather... &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;done. I guess we could&apos;ve seen it through to the end... but we didn&apos;t. That place was horrible. I felt like a worse person just by being there.
I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and guess that you know about our penchant for riddles. I suppose I can play along.

*His stomach squeals like a squeezed mouse.*
*As your muscles quiver, his stony face relaxes. A playful smile twitches his lips.*
She... she needs me...
*You have another bottle for him if he&apos;ll tell you where to find the captain.*
I&apos;m playing Helene, hero of the whole world! Who are you playing?
*Her hand is cold and smooth, like that of a porcelain doll. Jerkily, as if unused to movement, she strokes your hand gently and looks into your eyes.*
The great Sourcerer Saheila escaped Fort Joy. Perhaps she can help us. She&apos;ll likely seek her tribe in the Cullwoods.
*Protest. You and he are &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; alike.*
*The Silent Watcher&apos;s jaws clench and slacken again and again, for no visible reason. Two empty eyes stare straight ahead, like the black button eyes of a child&apos;s stuffed doll.*
How bracing and honest of you. But everything in moderation, eh? I don&apos;t think I could take a scolding from the world&apos;s potential saviour &lt;i&gt;too frequently.&lt;/i&gt;
He&apos;s my friend! I like him too. But he has a terrible sense of humour.
Doubt I have much to fit a lizard.
*Say you faced great peril in helping him; you hope a powerful Dragon Knight like himself might prove a worthy ally.*

*Remark that you think there&apos;s more to his story - he can trust you, if there&apos;s something he wants to get off his chest...*
*A single tear appears at the corner of one eye, but he ignores it.*
