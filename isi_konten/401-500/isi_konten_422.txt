You...? You healed me? But we&apos;ve never even spoken. I owe you a debt.
Sebille! It is so good to see you once more. I must speak with you. It is of the greatest importance.
*She freezes, then starts to visibly tremble. A tear rolls down her cheek.*
They said it like I was the cornerstone of their existence. Isn&apos;t that silly? I didn&apos;t even know myself.
Undeployed Smoke Trap
Demonically Possessed
*Say he should send his people - whoever remains of them - to have a look for themselves. He&apos;ll want a full report.*
*Nod. You&apos;re the one and only Red Prince.*
Search for the two pieces of the Swornbreaker.
The Adventurer&apos;s Field Guide&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making your own clothes couldn&apos;t be easier. Just take some scraps of cloth or leather, and get to work with needle and thread. If you&apos;re the magic type, you&apos;ve probably heard about how wizards enchant their needle and thread with magic powder or something first, gives them better results. We&apos;re not all wizards though, and I don&apos;t trust them, so you&apos;re on your own with that.
Understood
*She leans in, her eyes sparkling.*
Tinkerer
We found powerful Sourcerers to help us unlock our true potential. We left Reaper&apos;s Coast as true Godwoken, headed for the Nameless Isle.
As slaves their servants often are portrayed...
CAWKAW! RICAW!
Blessed Ice Infusion Skillbook
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;m perfect. I&apos;m wonderful. I&apos;m free at last.&lt;/i&gt;
*Leave the cantankerous spirit be. You&apos;ve had enough of her.*
Seems it&apos;s high time you learned your lesson.
*Squints...* Oh hey, you&apos;re right. You look just like a dwarf what had a run-in with boss last week. But now that I think of it, she was got rid of later that same day. Never mind.
It will come for our people. It will destroy us all.
Ifan took great offence to my use of Deathfog and left the party.
Oh yes - the town is all atwitter over your escapades at the gate! It&apos;s the perfect time to replace the hunting supplies you&apos;ve lost, yes?
Find the demon.
Real antiques at realistic prices! Who cares to trade?
I reckon I should just leave you be, then. Farewell to you.
*Tell him you&apos;ll show him true madness if he doesn&apos;t get to the point.*
For help with my contract I must contact a Magister Borris in the ghetto of Fort Joy. I met the chap already. I didn&apos;t much like him.
Reinforced Door
Elven Shield
*Tell them the cat is right. The master may be grateful for a dog&apos;s devotion, but that&apos;s not love.*
Oh please. You don&apos;t have the money for that.
Well of course it is. It was crafted with care.
*Remark that he should just follow up a good lead when he gets one - the proof will surface eventually.*
*Ask if he knows a way out of here.*
Medium Resist All Potion
*&apos;Hush child,&apos; your mother whispers, her scaled hand squeezing yours. &apos;It&apos;s okay. You&apos;re home now. Home with me...&apos;*
Add-on load failed.
Invite Party
It is as you say. In any case, no curse could possibly be worse than this droning drivel.
Well yeah. A lot. A lot, a lot! But he&apos;s my friend, and it&apos;s better if your friends are happy.
Don&apos;t be shy; citizens and enemies alike may be eager to share their stories.
&lt;b&gt;So be it. You were a fool to make such an offer while alone - now there will be nobody to save you.&lt;/b&gt;
*Offer your condolences for the loss of her husband.*
I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way, my dear.
*The raven turns its gore-streaked beak towards you. Its eyes are a deep, bloody red. &apos;Godwoken!&apos; it croaks as it takes to the air, circling the glade. &apos;Godwoken!&apos;*
*Admit you have your doubts. She seems a bit... unstable, doesn&apos;t she?*
We broke the seal of the blazing statue, revealing a passage into a vault.
What in the seven hells is a lizard doing here? Shouldn&apos;t you be in your empire? Or stretched out on a rock in the sun?
No - no, you most certainly don&apos;t.
I stand with the elf; Lohse has lost herself completely.
Slaughter the Sallow Man.
Okay. I&apos;ll wait right here. In this exaaaact spot.
These Seekers have such a limited skillset...
*Show her the invitation you took from the drunk woman in the street.*
Well, that&apos;s one task marked off the list...
That Seeker was out for my blood... you have most impressive skills of persuasion, Sourcerer...
You&apos;ve come far, Godwoken. The Seekers were right to put their faith in you.
*Observe that whatever crimes she committed in her past, she seems to be making up for them now.*
*The creature barely notices your presence.*
*Look closer at the ruins reflected in his ghostly eyes.*
What is happening out here?! Haven&apos;t we seen enough tragedy today?
(I know, Geraldine. I know. Now &lt;i&gt;shut up!) &lt;/i&gt;Look, we really do need your assistance.
Ranger&apos;s Boots
Ifan&apos;s Blood Vial
Can it be? An elf! Ah, I&apos;ve been abominably rude. Please - forgive me! I&apos;m so very out of practice. It&apos;s been... so long since I met another living soul.
I&apos;ve had my vengeance; I&apos;ve won back my name, and now I can transcend. What greater saga than the slave becoming a goddess?
Invite
[JESTER] *Chirp excitedly. Ooh, ooh, ooh! A hyperactive squirrel saw a thunderstorm! Boo hoo!*
Ngh... shut up! Let go! Let go! LET GO!
Sorry, I&apos;m here with someone else.
Eithne the Trader
We&apos;ll see if you&apos;ll still trumpet the virtues of the law when its executors turn to us with malicious intent.
Tavern
Troll
Hmm. I hear something scurrying around.
I&apos;m still thinking about... well, all of it. I should probably take notes, but it just doesn&apos;t seem important right now.
*Reach for your weapon.*
You&apos;ve found an &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Electric Discharge Scroll&lt;/font&gt;! Try it out on a puddle of water or a steam cloud and see what happens.
So someone finally took Murga down a peg or two, eh? Maybe I can put you through your paces sometime, ha!
*Tell him you hope it won&apos;t be necessary for innocents to die.*
[This is a children&apos;s grammar book. Etched into the first page is &apos;Property of Arx School&apos; and scrawled onto the last page is &apos;Magister Timort smells like cheese.&apos;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In between, there&apos;s pages full of all the tedious writing rules you never thought you&apos;d need to know, in excruciating detail.]
Paladin Tar Cantor
Magical Steel Crossbow
*Brusquely ignore the spirit&apos;s pleasantries and turn to leave.*
Debuff Finesse Potion
Water Barrel
Fine Fists
Nicked that from your pocket when we started talkin&apos;. You should probably brush up on the ol&apos; stealin&apos; skills, huh?
Zaleskar
*Cross your fingers behind your back and bow. Yes - whatever the missus wishes.*
I don&apos;t know what that is, and I don&apos;t want to hang around long enough to find out.
Only the elven Godwoken could bring the elves together once more.
Stuff! Beautiful and beguiling stuff! Buying and selling!
Ancient Depository
The snare cut so deep. The blindfold... It made me panic! The dark...
*Lohse blinks and turns towards Malady.*
Find the corpse of Garvan&apos;s master.
*Ask how she came to worship Amadia. What lead her down this path?*
Looks that way. I&apos;d spit too, but- well, you know...
*Tell him you can deal with them when they cross you.*
Ben-Mezd! Good to see you, sir!
Skills
...
These Voidwoken appeared, thanks to him. It was... messy. A lot of the locals didn&apos;t make it, an&apos; those that did... well, there&apos;s a price for helping Sourcerers...
Permanent Intelligence Potion
I warned you. Now, you pay!
Gerroff!
Gods, it&apos;s Lord Haha &apos;ack again. Great. Just great.
I am blessed, fresh-pearl, by drudanae and divinity. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
There is no turning back.
We stole the beggar&apos;s gold.
*The rodent lays its paw on your boot and you feel something. In some corner of your mind, a new way of crafting magic slowly emerges.*
House Interior - Estate C
*Show him the artefact you found in the archives. Is this the other piece?*
*Tell her a small sum should do the trick.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
You don&apos;t seem to be doing that well. Flee by using the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Flee skill&lt;/font&gt; on your Hotbar, or search for the Flee skill in your skill panel.
Better to kill a man honestly than to lock him up with a demon for eternity.
*You recall Telem. House of War. The poison made him claw out his own eyes before dying of shock.*
A gush of wind. A sliver of light. &lt;i&gt;Light!&lt;/i&gt; I hardly knew it for what it was.
You are victorious; there is nothing more for you here. Leave it, so that others may prove themselves.
*Ask how you become Divine.*
*Suggest that if it helps you, you just might.*
*Let her take the lead. She&apos;s setting off fireworks in your mind, the reverberations of them forcing out any other thought than &lt;i&gt;this.*&lt;/i&gt;
*An electric feeling pulses in your fingertips and a forcefield of some kind pushes you away from the tablet.*
You do not do the smart thing. Prepare to die!
*Ask if there&apos;s anywhere he&apos;d like the Lady Vengeance to bring him to.*
Betray me, and you&apos;ll meet the same fate as the others. Now go.
You don&apos;t get it. If you want to be a real team, real partners, you have to... be of a mind. You and I aren&apos;t of a mind.
[OUTLAW] *An Order man? Tell him he&apos;s a two-faced sham of an outlaw.*
[VILLAIN] *Tell him you plan on killing every Magister in your path until you swim free on a wave of blood.*
My thanks, friend. I would say I owe you my life, but I owe you so, so much more.
Poisoned Dinner
*He raises his eyebrows.*
Why... my eternal gratitude, of course.
Attack
*Say you think it&apos;s all delusional nonsense.*
We both know why you&apos;ve come. We both know where I must take us.
Are you sure? Normal arrows are limitless but special arrows are not. Try a better combination with the arrowhead before creating an arrow.
The House of Gods or the House of War: I see precious little difference between their methods.
You returned to the world as a Godwoken who failed to become Divine.
Slayer
You thief! Someone, help!
*The Knight of Duna&apos;s features slacken. He looks almost calm... but the moment passes and his maniacal scowl creeps back.*
*Repeat his first words in wonder: twenty-two centuries?*
*Tell her you know the roar. It belongs to the Devourer.*
&lt;i&gt;I had to hide from the Gods. So I had the walls of this crypt equipped with Tenebrium and protections put in place. It worked. Everyone, even the Gods, thought me dead.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell it to shut up or you&apos;ll give it a kicking.*
*With that, Ifan salutes you. He whistles up his soulwolf and strides off to make arrangements, looking from head to toe every bit a leader of men.*
Steam Cloud
I need it! Don&apos;t you understand? I will never know who my true enemy is if I do not see the memories. I have to taste it. I &lt;i&gt;must.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the spirit you&apos;ll kill the one who must be killed.*
Wooden Shoes
Amulet
We chose what was right. I pray you do the same.
Welcome back, most avid practitioner. Though my heart urges you to go forth and find your way in the world: &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; world, the world of the One.
Possessed Godwoken
Where else to be? We were sealed in here by Braccus Rex after his treacherous concubine convinced him we were planning to rebel.
You are equipped well enough for a bar-room brawl, my friend. But if you strike from the shadows as effectively as you strike in the light, you may find my supplies... invaluable.
