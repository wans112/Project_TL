Finally we shall fulfil the prophecy. Finally we will lay together and beget the dragons that are our destiny!
Why, so that &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;can ascend? No, you are not ready.
I hope you&apos;ll fare well. Maybe them folks of yours will see the light.
I&apos;ll read that as... excitement? Gratitude? Battle lust?
Do you have it? Do you have the book I seek?
Toggle your Armour
*Gareth greets you warmly. He&apos;s oddly chipper - more chipper than you&apos;ve ever seen him, actually.*
We gave Wyvlia up to the Magisters. Carver asked us to kill her.
Power Infusion
*She raises an eyebrow at you, but doesn&apos;t comment farther.*
Gas Pipe
To consume a being&apos;s Source is to consume their memories, their loves, their essence... all the echoes of themselves, gone. It is worse than death. It is oblivion.
*He does not tear his gaze away from the cascade, but he raises a hand and points northwards, back and down the hill towards the sea.*
I may not agree with you on most things... but I think we make a decent team.
*Cough...* Grbbt.
You&apos;re sure? I swore I could smell the Source on him...
Exploration Theme 02 Light Pastoral
Body
But do be careful not to get caught. I was their guest for a time, and I promise you, the gallows was the most comfortable part of the experience.
*Insist - why he was so curious about the Gods?*
*Insist you don&apos;t have anything more for him.*
There&apos;s a reproduction on display at the Cathedral - not the same as viewing the original of course, but it gives the great unwashed something to pray before.
We gave Wyvlia up. Magister Bellworth is looking into it.
...but of course that was all still rather innocent. I could tell you all about something &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; special some other time if you like.
*Ask how in the world he&apos;s standing here when the city is covered in Deathfog.*
Bone Spider
*Other plans. That&apos;s it. You&apos;ve other plans.*
Nearly there my darling, then you can play with all your brothers and sisters.
Hmm. Nothing unusual here.
*Ask the spirit how she knows you&apos;re Godwoken.*
*He grins, revealing stumps of blackened teeth.*
Even if his wings could spread... where might he take me?
Imagine the cost of this lot though - you could buy a townhouse for it!
Damage When Moving
Hardly respectful for a guest to take his host&apos;s seat at the table. It seems like we owe these beings...
Praise unto the Goddess! There may yet be hope for today.
I suppose we are all Source, just in different forms. You being the cruder, less jewel-encrusted form, naturally.
Off with you, then, and keep your nose clean.
Heroes&apos; Rest
Please help...
Run, Coral! Get out. Now!
*The woman throws the man a look, before turning back to you.*
We need to move the bed.
A simple rod, suitable for saltwater or freshwater fishing. Or mischief.
*Take a step forward.*
*He gives no sign of seeing you.*
Isbeil&apos;s brewin&apos; the stuff down in the sewers. Don&apos;t know where they&apos;re planning on using it, but I don&apos;t want to be around when they do.
Mistress saved me when I was a kitten. She took me in, fed me and kept me warm. She deserves loyalty.
She sacrificed herself for the betterment of Rivellon.
You live. We hear your heartbeat. We feel your breath. Come closer...
By my empire, yes! At long last we shall become lover.
*Shrug and say that these things happen. Her tears aren&apos;t bringing anyone back to life.*
Hey there, chief.
Rich, creamy, and comfortingly deadly.
You&apos;re Undead. You scared someone, and they attacked you. Cover your head, your legs, and your torso and you&apos;ll find people less hostile. Use the equipment panel.
*In this tome, Huwbert the historian assembles the bulk of what is still known to the larger world about the infamous Braccus Rex, and creates a lightly drawn portrait that feels somewhat incomplete - but also carries the ring of truth. Braccus was once a fine human being and a noble ruler. But his greed overtook him and he became corrupted. There is mention of Cassandra, a twin sister, to whom Braccus did unspeakable things - stealing her life force that he may live forever. Unfortunately, these crimes saw him arrested by Source Hunters, hanged until dead, and his body thrown into a well. Rumours abound that this was not the end, but until Huwbert can confirm these outlandish tales - as exciting and dramatic as they are - he refuses to add them to his chronicle.*
*Tell the door you&apos;ve forgotten your password. Ask to be reminded.*
+1 point = +[1]% damage.
*Give Almira the Swornbreaker.*
Taking matters into my own hands.
You&apos;re welcome. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me...
*Heed the warning and step away.*
&lt;i&gt;Two timezzz no.&lt;/i&gt;
It does, right?
Our grandmaster for one! Lord Kemm would never stand for this kind of nonsense. Thing is, people on the mainland don&apos;t know what goes on here. Never would have believed it myself until I saw it with my own eyes.
Poisonous Turtle
*She peers closely at you.*
*It sounds like he needs a companion. Ask if he&apos;d like to travel with you.*
Torturing that elf just to get high... disgusting.
I offer little beyond the wisdom of the ancients.
*A... a box? How is she even still sane?*
You expecting a tip? Well, here&apos;s one: exfoliate!
*Tell the figure that&apos;s a great idea. You&apos;ll start by routing it like an infection and freeing yourself once and for all.*
*Tell the Magister to call off their search - the chef is behind the disappearances!*
Help
Disembodied Voice
*He ostentatiously fluffs up his feathers and turns back to his sordid repast.*
Queen Justinia of the dwarves was fooled into thinking that only the genocide of the entire population of Arx could save the Dwarven Kingdom from its doom.
*He takes your hand in his gauntlet-clad fist and shakes it - there&apos;s a lot more power in his grip than his slender frame would suggest.*
Ha! How fitting an end to the disaster that was our acquaintance.
You may take your leave. And take it somewhere else.
The Mother Tree calls you, Godwoken. The Mother Tree calls. Climb to the heart!
We may have judged her too harshly.
You are right. How many years did it take for her to see a single truth in a mess of lies? There&apos;ll be another, and another. She will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be played the fool!
None of the captains could articulate why.
Ha! That&apos;s the spirit. Down the hatch, then. Thorn will eat you up.
*Say that your arrival saved him. A few words doesn&apos;t seem excessive payment for that.*
A beam? Perhaps we can harness its power somehow...
*Note the open trunks and piles of clothes littering the room and ask if he&apos;s packing for a trip.*
*Allow him to take the gold piece. He gives you a dirty look and stalks away.*
Do you know Dallis? She fears us. Of course she does. She knows what we&apos;ll do.
*Ask again why she thinks she deserves release?*
Dunaâ€™s Undertaker attacked us after we failed its test.
Well there ya are. Been tryin&apos; my hand at a few bows &apos;n&apos; such, like ya asked. Hope ya like what ya see.
You got what you can out of me, alright? Big Tomorrah&apos;s in the sewers with her band of burglars. That&apos;s as much as I know.
Ungh, unholy hells...
Knight of Duna&apos;s Helm
SqueakySqueakSqueakSqueaky!
My brothers and sisters are - well...
*...you stole the capacitor from the Chancellor&apos;s own table. But then you heard a noise. You heard the sound of your best friend&apos;s murder. You fled.*
*There&apos;s something familiar about the way he holds that book...*
*Push him against the bookcase and kiss him deeply.*
Matron of Agony
*Keep your expression neutral. This is for her to finish, not you.*
Wings
And I wonder: Did I do right by them? &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; I do right by them? Have I been blind to lead them down this path?
*She looks you up and down. A smile breaks across her face.*
...I came prepared for the occasion!
*She winks over her shoulder at you and then... &lt;i&gt;disappears.*&lt;/i&gt;
You know, as in &apos;gorilla warfare&apos;? Boy, I thought you had a funny bone in ya, but I swear some witch doctor&apos;s gone and yanked it out!
Get to Arx, and keep that Deathfog from swallowin&apos; the city.
Ok ok OK, no more distractions. I&apos;m gonna go hide! Ready...
Ah yes, I have heard that your people enjoy various fermented fruits and vegetables. It often seems to be involved in -
But I want to be with Mihaly. That is why the God King and I must part ways. That is why I need a Swornbreaker.
It was my intention to raise the subject with him.
After you.
*She pants and wipes her mouth; blood smears across her sleeve.*
*The squirrel lays his hand on you and a strange feeling ripples through your body: a sense of power. Your mind opens to the possibilities of new magic.*
We found the curved blade of the Swornbreaker.
No magic was needed. Would that the Empress was here to dispose of you for such an insult. My loyalty was true.
Violet Amulet
Possessed Marksman
*The hum of the relic grows louder and bright light starts to spill from its runes. Cracks start to spread across the surface, and it shatters like glass.*
The Magisters raid my village. They call me Sourcerer and collar me. This I can endure.
*She&apos;s assuming an air of levity, but she&apos;s clearly unwell. Ask her what&apos;s wrong.*
*An automaton, massive and imposing, creaks to life as you approach.*
P-p-praise means nothing! I would reject it if it meant a chance to t-turn back the clock and worship Braccus Rex as he demanded.
You godsdamned son of a - ! &lt;i&gt;You tricked me.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you heard it from a dead lizard.*
Please. Alexandar is not the man you once knew. He can bring us together. You must believe me.
Forget it.
Only a coward or an imbecile would invite Isbeil into her court. Either way, she deserves to die.
Yeah? You&apos;re good with the Magisters caging anyone up that looks at them funny?
And what would they have to say to someone like you?
*Bishop Alexandar looks up at the sound of your voice, curiosity on his face. Recognition seems to flicker in his eyes for a moment, but then he shakes his head and looks back towards the suffering Atusa.*
The egg is cold and firm to the touch, as if carved from stone. Perhaps it could hatch if given enough time...
Unstable
Restores [1] Physical Armour each turn.
...tschick tschick tschick...
*This shrine fills you with a sense of peace. It is a safe haven.*
[SEBILLE] *Say that you&apos;re looking for an old acquaintance of yours. You have a score to settle... in skin.*
Gloves of the Black Arts
*Ask about this &apos;witch&apos;. What makes her so dangerous?*
*Tell her you&apos;d like to have a gander at what she has on offer.*
Ba-bock!
*Say that she&apos;d be wise to ignore your presence completely.*
Range: [1]&lt;br&gt;Oil slows characters down and can be set on fire.
An unconvincing story. You&apos;re under arrest!
Quite the tail on you! Penny for a sick dog?
On Source Orbs, Part 3
*You don&apos;t trust this serpentine god. Turn and leave.*
KILLING BLOW!
We found Tarquin loitering by the Stonegarden. It seems he&apos;s looking for some ancient buried artefacts.
*The child squeezes a few tears out. They drip down his face in big, shimmering droplets.*
*The Magister utters a pitiful moan, but nothing more.*
*Roll your eyes. Do you &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like a Sourcerer?*
It&apos;s locked fast.
*He tosses you a device, and you instantly see it used to power a lever that will open a door. You pocket it.*
