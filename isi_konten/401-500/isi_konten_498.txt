You have to understand; Lucian&apos;s Deathfog &lt;i&gt;broke &lt;/i&gt;us - we were left defeated, leaderless... and then the God King started to speak to us. He offered victory, immortality... anything we desired, in exchange for loyalty. How could we refuse?
*Rest your hand on your weapon. If he&apos;s a Djinn, then you demand three wishes.*
Another!
*Say: &apos;Soup.&apos;*
Tok tok...
Bad man, so bad. I liked his house. Big garden of stones, lots and lots of bones to dig. Good, tasty bones!
My dear gods, I really don&apos;t know. Maybe he went to his house? It&apos;s over by the barracks! What&apos;s going on? Is he going to be...
Scratch. Bite. Bark? Kill!

*Leave him in peace.*
*Glare at him. He doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about.*
You most certainly &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;. The Well of Ascension is a lake: a pool of pure Source in which the powers of the Seven lie united.
All that matters is: he&apos;s dead. No longer can he stand in my way, or pose a threat to Sadha - which quite calls for a celebratory round of drinks as far as I&apos;m concerned.

That little creep! He won&apos;t get away with it.
We found Dot&apos;s dog collar. Perhaps it will convince him that his master prefers Cottontail.
Come now. Be nice. This is serious.
Romantic
No tellin&apos; where there might be more. We need to move!
[OUTLAW] *Move closer, but clench your fists in case things go south.*
*Ask it nicely to open up. Please.*
*An inscription at the terrarium&apos;s base identifies its contents as a &apos;wailing mandrake&apos; - a species you&apos;ve not heard of in spite of your impressive scholarship.*
*Reach out to comfort the spirit.*
Divine be praised then! A satisfactory conclusion... most satisfactory... perhaps I&apos;ll even win a promotion.
The boat is mine, it responds only to me. You tried to take my boat, and there&apos;s a price to be paid for that...
*Say that you found a man hiding from the Magisters in the fish factory.*
We&apos;re not alike, you and I.
*Apologise, and ask him who he is.*
Arx was abandoned to the Deathfog and the dead.
*It sounds like he was being worked to the bone. What was the rush?*
After long years as a spy in the world,
Setting the resolution higher than the recommended resolution may result in an unstable system!
About the two of us? I thought there was no such thing, or at least not in the sense I surmise you&apos;re implying.
*Among the long-crumbled remains of the temple that must have once sheltered his shrine, the stone effigy of a god seems to invite you to put your hands in his.*
Don&apos;t beat yourself up. You did what you could.
The time of Source is over.
Simple Dwarven Cider
What was in that blasted stew?
Your need to see what lay behind the Veil doomed us all. It doomed this world to a plague of scheming gods and primitive creatures.
An empty jar of the sort used to contain the ghastly essence of a soul.

Human Mask of the Shapeshifter
You look lost. Also you look all weird and sinister. And you look kinda... dangerous... so I immediately wish I hadn&apos;t just called you sinister. Don&apos;t hurt me, I can&apos;t help myself!
Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. A Godwoken. But there&apos;s no divinity to be had, is there? Not for you, and &lt;i&gt;clearly&lt;/i&gt; not for me.&lt;br&gt;
*A bright sparkle of laughter follows your proposal.*
Hope to see you for some of the Lucian&apos;s Day celebrations later.
*Take your leave.*

The God King. He &lt;i&gt;comes. &lt;/i&gt;If we wish to avoid his wrath, we must do as he says.
Nothing special, just the head covering of a regular citizen.
*How tragic, you think, that she can never see her own beauty.*
First, I&apos;ll hear the man out. If he can lead me to the Princess... well, I can spare my ears a moment or two for &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.

You do not seek our master - he shall seek you. Alas, he will not find you in this world, but perhaps in the next.
Catch baddies! Buddy? Baddies. Baddies?! Buddy!
Just look at you! &apos;Strong as a bull,&apos; I hear you lot say. Makes me moo, that does, but you look as strong as my buddy and me combined!
Can&apos;t remember.
*Smile. You&apos;d be happy to turn them into gloves, if he points you towards them.*
*Whisper the suggestion that the Sourceress was innocent - she used her Source because of the Magisters&apos; repression. That the Void answered was not her fault.*

Letter
Time... time has a way of changing someone. Lucian did not start as the man he became. You are now a guiding star. When the people look to you for light... I pray you shine.
*Despite your  best efforts, your mind returns to that day, aeons ago. Your discovery of the veil of creation. Your appeal to the King. His refusal. Your turning to the Seven lords. The King&apos;s displeasure...*
*Ask what you can do to help.*
Red Prince! At last we meet, or rather: meet with your awareness of my presence. How often I&apos;ve stood by you but an arm&apos;s length away, a shadow within the shadows - untouchable.
Your war owl came. I confess I had no idea just how grave the situation had come to be. The Black Ring &lt;i&gt;back,&lt;/i&gt; for all that&apos;s holy?
I&apos;ve trusted before. And been burnt by that trust.
*Reflected in the mirror of his eyes, you see yourself: majestic, powerful, emanating an aura of purest Source. Ifan&apos;s lip curls slightly and he looks away.*
I&apos;ll keep an eye on ya. Make sure you stay out of trouble. Or in it, if that floats your boat.

Because it is expeditious to do so. My master would have this isle cleared as quickly as possible.
*You don&apos;t need her help. You already know where to go.*
After an epiphany arising from the phrase &apos;sunny side up&apos;, he started a religion.
*Step back from the crumbling skeleton. You hope it&apos;s not contagious...*
Still too heavy.
*Steel your stare and wait for his assessment.*
*You dress and cast a loving glance over her body, soft with sleep.*

*For some reason the two of them burst into guffaws. Ifan claps the man on the back, and turns to leave.*
Consider it done. Good luck in the trials to come, Godwoken.
Now, I bestow upon you the blessing of the One. Enjoy its benefits, for as long as it lasts.
Well, look at that. A pure masterpiece of the porcine school!
G&apos;head.
*The pressure now threatens to shatter every bone and swallow your very soul. And then it lifts, just as the spirit dissolves into oblivion with a spectral scream.*
Well. I &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; a plan. Gratiana told me of weapons that could counter these Shriekers. Purging Wands that steal Source from its host.
I know a lizard of taste when I see one! Care to trade?
*Tell the pig hello. It&apos;s good to see her again!*
*Tell her that you were forced to kill Gareth on the island.*
*Nod; you&apos;d known him. He was just that - a proud man, a decent man.*
*There&apos;s a cough behind you. Turning, you see... Xantezza. Not some allegorical figure, not some awe-inspiring god, just... her. She&apos;s leaning against one of the struts on the platform, taking you in.*
&lt;i&gt;I scent Source...&lt;/i&gt;
Ma, I&apos;m f-i-i-i-ne.
We found a note behind a painting of the Outlaw Empress in Lord Kemm&apos;s vault. It mentioned a dragon&apos;s helm and a code: 2-3-2-1-1-3.
Thank you, but I&apos;ll be quite alright soon. *Gurgle* Yes. Soon, soon, soon.
But! I suppose that&apos;s behind me, isn&apos;t it. Perhaps the next batch will be more interesting.
It&apos;s do or die.
Very good. I chose you for a reason. I knew your shoulders were broad enough to bear this weight.
