Voracious Hunger
Improved Initiative Aura
*Ask what the Black Ring is doing here.*
You can&apos;t buy my friendship.
Nnng...
...
How... what... - the leash is &lt;i&gt;cut?!&lt;/i&gt;
Better take you to prison, then!
I... I don&apos;t think you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; understand. This blood, his blood. It&apos;s on your hands. And on &lt;i&gt;mine...&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit of an elegantly dressed woman glances around; seemingly more interested in the other guests than in the unfolding ceremony.*
The Djinn is dead.
But always they would find me - the Scions. Always the Mother Tree would call me back, for one day I&apos;d be free no longer. One day my legs would be roots; to wander would be but one lone memory among millions.
[1][2]% damage as [3] damage
What does it mean to be Godwoken?
If you want treasure, go find a mirror.
Now you&apos;re getting the idea.
*Stare at Sir Lora and repeat that you &lt;i&gt;saved the world&lt;/i&gt;.*
*It&apos;s probably nothing. You&apos;ll just wait this out.*
You think any of these Magisters know what their esteemed m&apos;lady is up to?
*The creature doesn&apos;t acknowledge your question. It stares at the ground and shuffles away.*
No deal, thief. I&apos;ve got plans for you. Now come with me.
Elves have difficulty stomaching meaty flavours in their normal diet. What I prepare for them is a little less... &lt;i&gt;robust&lt;/i&gt;. The fare you receive is far superior.
Voidwoken are just... they&apos;re just monsters. They don&apos;t think. But you were supposed to help me. You &lt;i&gt;said&lt;/i&gt;.
*Call out his name.*
Where is it?! WHERE IS IT?! The head... I NEED it!
*Ask about the Seekers.*
Lookie lookie lookie here -
*She leans forward and grazes your cheek with her lips.*
I shall not be collared! I shall not be kept! I SHALL BE REBORN!
All apes look alike. They dress in black, but come in all shapes. Tall humans. Stunted dwarves. Creatures that stink of death.
For the g-g-g-g-glory of Lucian, there is no task unworthy! Here, we turned ab-ab-ab-ab-abominations into &lt;i&gt;SERVANTS&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;LORD!&lt;/i&gt;
Dwarven War Axe
Wait! No, please! I&apos;ll teach you! Just please, have mercy!
[1] xp
Ah! Straight to the scholarship of the matter. Very good!
*The woman looks around, taking it all in... then she wraps her arms around his waist and lays her head against his chest.*
*The nurse twists the folds of her robes around her fists while offering you a bloody smile of excitement.*
*Refuse to partake of the eagle&apos;s Master.*
&lt;i&gt;It just happened.&lt;/i&gt;
It is the laboratory of a lunatic. A place removed from mercy and sanity where mad Braccus Rex would experiment to his dark heart&apos;s content.
I swear if I could... ungh, if I weren&apos;t... *groan*.
White Magister Reimond tried to kill us and destroy the evidence in the vault.
*This will save the elves, no matter what the consequences. You should accept, you think...*
Ifan&apos;s Theme
In... in &lt;i&gt;my own home?!&lt;/i&gt;
Of course this &lt;i&gt;had &lt;/i&gt;to end in a crypt...
*Hush her and tell her you&apos;re here to get her out of Fort Joy.*
*Gareth&apos;s eyes go glassy. There is no warmth, no chill; no joy, no sadness. It as if the Void has possessed him.*
Game Master Vignette
Do you have any babies that need treatment? We&apos;re very good with babies...
Oh, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. A trivial detail. We address that transaction once we conclude the one at hand.
Well now.
Desk
&lt;i&gt;You don&apos;t look like a Magister.&lt;/i&gt;
Tattered Shoes
Tarlene
Yes... So you do. Must have been quite the display of Source. Very impressive.
[SEBILLE] *Smirk and say he&apos;s a dead man.*
From what I gather you&apos;ve no discernable qualities whatsoever. As such you&apos;re destined to be Houseless.
You! You are here to work. Are you also here to trade? I have much to show.
*You suddenly hear something in the distance. A strange tune. Sebille freezes. It&apos;s her scar song. The Master is near...*
Allows you to cast
...yet never sated, start their search afresh.
Are you one hundred percent sure about that? Sometimes I think all this has got to be a dream. If it isn&apos;t... I mean. &lt;i&gt;Whoa.&lt;/i&gt;
Loremaster
*Sadha and the Red Prince enter the wagon; close the door behind them. Nothing for it but to wait until they reemerge...*
Magical Lizard&apos;s Bow
*Tell her she makes a mean fire.*
*She reaches for her weapon.*
Go ahead. But be careful. She&apos;ll get in your head. You gotta fight it.
Sacrifice must be made willingly - our home was &lt;i&gt;stolen from us! &lt;/i&gt;Magisters destroyed our way of life to end the war they started... then they uprooted me, and... and...
*Say that it means being able to do anything you want.*
They- they- oh, Fane...
A sip of rum, a frothy pint of ale...
Unfinished Ring
Pain Aura
*He shudders, and abruptly turns to his subordinate.*
*Ask how you can help her.*
There, there. No need to be a sourpuss! You don&apos;t have to worry, darling: your secret&apos;s safe with me.
Wouldn&apos;t your eyes look good ripped out and stuck to the wall?
*...and then he, and his powers, are gone forever.*
Who am I to reject such a bounty? I&apos;m going to eat it.
Ah c&apos;mon, don&apos;t give me that! I&apos;d know that impish mug any ol&apos; place. Even this pit.
I left Reaper&apos;s Eye still cursed by the ring.
*Tell her she ought to be careful and keep a lid on her current visitor. It seems unstable.*
Magister Spear
Livestock
*Ask how he can still be here.*
Why not help each other?
Old Rotten Crossbow
What good will wings be when the Void swallows the skies?
Are you not? I am Amadia, mother of magic.
*The Paladin looks up, blood dripping from her mouth.*
An army? That close?! I thought there were just a couple of the dogs.
I would have liked to see that city again. Just once more...
Here. Take this. It&apos;s all yours.
&lt;b&gt;Silence! It is your King that has fallen. He and all the other Eternal cowards were flung into the Void. And the power you were too scared to hunt has made me a God.&lt;/b&gt;
*Beast&apos;s face goes red as beets. Were you inclined, you&apos;d crack an egg on his forehead, just to see it sizzle.*
Cannibalise Scroll
I entered the halls of the Council of Seven, one step closer to Divinity. Now I must be first to the Wellspring. Godhood awaits.
*Relax your grip and tell him to elaborate. Quickly now!*
*Say that you absolutely can: this was cold-blooded murder.*
*Choose white oak. It will bless you and your allies.*
You ought to dash off, now. But before you go - do me a favour, won&apos;t you? Take good care of Lohse. She&apos;s &lt;i&gt;special&lt;/i&gt;.
Gareth! No!
*Lean in close. Point a thumb at yourself. Tell him &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; a Sourcerer.*
LESS
You&apos;re weird.
Algae
Smoking Flame Grenade
*Loudly demand that he release you at once.*
It is you!
*Scream.*
I suppose dead men tell tales after all...
Well I&apos;ll be. Are you ready for your kind to be celebrated in poetry?
Please... I don&apos;t know... the whereabouts... of the Master...
Whoever is behind all this will have to try harder if they want to stop us.
*Draw your weapon and attack. You&apos;re sick of talking.*
Do not! &lt;i&gt;He &lt;/i&gt;would be... angry.
Oh!
If you seek to strengthen your bond to the Source, I&apos;ve nothing left to show you and nothing left to say. Take what you must from my home. But my memories and masteries - they remain with me.
[ELF] *Respond to the guard with a traditional elven greeting, and say that you wish to see your fellow elves.*
The Shadow Prince sent us in search of the Mother Tree.
I gave away nearly a &lt;i&gt;tenth &lt;/i&gt;of my fortune to make things right with the gods, and I met with the same fate as the dung-smeared paupers...? It&apos;s not right!
Shed Skin
Constitution Lowered
*Shake your head. You can&apos;t shake the feeling that you&apos;ve made a mistake.*
Fire
Hmm. Well, I&apos;ll be around and about.
Encounters
*The elf glares and pulls aside his ragged red clothing - beneath it, his chest is laced with a series of scars - old war wounds by the looks of them.*
Let&apos;s attribute those manners to your &lt;i&gt;guest,&lt;/i&gt; shall we?
*Leave the spirit be.*
*The grip on your lungs loosens. You take a long breath, enjoying the cool air that flows into you.*
This - this is...
Worn from use, the needle&apos;s point remains sharp, for Sebille&apos;s skin is the canvas upon which she marks her victims.
Exceptional. Truly. The bond &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be broken...
*Run at him. Strike at him. Silence him!*
*Say you are transporting the pack for a friend, and promised you would keep its contents private.*
Actually, hang on for another moment, would you?
The Master. He&apos;s on the island. I&apos;m closer to my prey than I&apos;ve been in years. Might as well be a continent away.
*Clasp your hands in thanks. You will not let her down.*
Well, that was... my word.
Kemm&apos;s Journal
Competing to seize the powers of Divinity.
*Tell him the head is gone forever. It was consumed.*
Nonsense. I just had to take time to renew my spirit. Lucian said, &apos;I will refresh the tired and satisfy the weary.&apos; Words as true today as when he said them.
Demonic Possession
Seeker! You&apos;re to join in the attack - do me proud.
*Tell him you don&apos;t need anything right now.*
Character is dead.
When I was a slave, I used to pray to a picture like this. Pray for freedom. Too bad that gods are deaf.
...we were &lt;i&gt;dragons&lt;/i&gt; once! Great, red dragons.
*Look at the cow askance. Is it enjoying the destruction here?*
I know, it&apos;s plain to see.
*He turns back to the body, prodding at its face cautiously.*
Really? Well perhaps that says more about the calibre of their intellect than anything else. Such a device would be a gross overconcentration of power - it could purge the entire world of all Source... luckily the laws of the universe render such a thing impossible.
So they are. My arms are gravestones, many a lost soul&apos;s last rest.
They are his servants and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is his threat. His promise. You can&apos;t let it happen. You &lt;i&gt;have &lt;/i&gt;to stop him.
Miscellaneous
Kniles the Flenser
*He gives you a pointed look, then settles himself once more in the bed, and goes back to sleep.*
*As you pull your hand away you can feel a deep, longing sadness in your soul. Is it regret? Or just sadness for a life that used to be?*
Today, my child, we start anew.
*You recognise the trumpet. This is the Queen of Pearls, playing a fanfare for her lover Duna, the god of all dwarves.*
*He breathes a long, lugubrious sigh.*
Unlock affected object(s).[2][3]
Dallis&apos; Stateroom
Hm. I can&apos;t make out the script.
*He nuzzles even closer.*
*Smile and say you&apos;ve lost count of the Voidwoken you&apos;ve slain recently.*
Soon enough, they&apos;ll be little more than dead, dry husks, light enough to knock down with a puff of air.
Reveal yourself!
*The disheveled pair eye you with hope, though their hope is tinged with mistrust. The lizard notices your collar and steps towards you.*
*Several hours later, you awaken with her lips on yours.*
*Ask what a member of the Royal Guard is doing so far from the kingdom.*
Feygr Bloodspawn
*The White Magister strikes a defensive pose just as the hanging Sourcerer breaks free of his bond.*
You can&apos;t buy your way out of trouble like this. Off to prison with you!
With the Dreamer thou must speak of what thou art and what thou shalt be...
Friends
*Accept the exchange.*
