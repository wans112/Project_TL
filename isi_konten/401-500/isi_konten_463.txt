You were useful, useful as a good hammer is to a stonemason...
Oh! Yes! Only a few have ever guessed right! You get a prime discount on our Sourcerous Sundries!
I like how you look. You look neat.
*Scratch your head. Where would all these extra people live?*
*Shake your head. You&apos;re so sorry.*
*&apos;...nothing burns in rainfall, and smoke gets in your hair...&apos;*
*Nod silently. There&apos;s no point arguing with a zealous believer.*

This I see within you, above all my many children. I hope I am not wrong.

Long may Your Majesty live *cough* and long may be your reign.

The Great Acorn is - and I really cannot stress this enough, Quercus - the end of the bloody world!
We have to tend to our dead before regrouping. They sacrificed themselves for the Order - we owe them the proper respects.
Those eyes... those &lt;i&gt;eyes&lt;/i&gt;.. but now I know what made them gleam so: Apotheosis!
*You&apos;ve hit a nerve. He looks away.*

[IFAN] *Say that you no longer agree to do things unless the consequences are crystal clear.*
One piece. Something like that, anyway.

Mercifulness
You&apos;re not the first. I doubt you&apos;ll be the last.
There you are, Godwoken. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;eage&lt;/i&gt;r to hear your good news.
&lt;i&gt;Only as Divine&lt;/i&gt; can you defeat the Void. &lt;i&gt;Only as Divine&lt;/i&gt; can you deliver us from evil. &lt;i&gt;Only as Divine &lt;/i&gt;can you save dwarvenkind - and all Rivellon - from the coming darkness.
I pursued my guiding star. I&apos;d no idea it would lead me so astray. But it&apos;s still the only star I knew to follow in the darkness. Yet perhaps - perhaps I&apos;ve found another.
The details are... detailed. Suffice it to say that Meistr Siva believed she could help me. And I believe you&apos;re twice the Sourcerer she ever was.
Because suicide is a different matter entirely!
Possessed
*Inside you, Zorl-Stissa rumbles in protest.*
Driftwood dwarf. In charge of the queen&apos;s dirty work.
Kinda. Just answer, okay?
*Ask what she was doing here.*
She may be... &lt;i&gt;unpredictable&lt;/i&gt;... but she&apos;s still Lohse.
There you are. I&apos;ve been looking for Lohse. I suppose she can sense how close she is to&lt;i&gt; him. &lt;/i&gt;Lucky for all of us, I&apos;ve been busy. I know exactly what we need to do to get him &lt;i&gt;out &lt;/i&gt;of Lohse&apos;s head and &lt;i&gt;into &lt;/i&gt;the palm of her hand.

Accurse this vile island! It&apos;ll be the death of us unless we find a way out.
I&apos;ll tell you something though. We&apos;d no problem with those filthy beasties till all these guards showed up.
&lt;i&gt;...hurt someone.&lt;/i&gt;

[SCHOLAR] *You have learned many hymns in your travels. Sing one now, in hopes of a response.*
YOU&apos;RE wrong.
I was just getting used to this seafaring life. You know, we could... ah, from the look in your eye I gather it&apos;s time to grab my things and get back to work?
Executioner Ninyan
*Take a moment of silence in Malady&apos;s memory.*
Forgiving
Suit yourself, Humdrum Harry, suit yourself...
The Doctor knows that the Advocate is dead. There may be consequences.
Ah, I have thirsted for this dark power. It is good to see balance restored.
Laslor&apos;s Lute
In this cave, we trust Saheila. She is young, but she sees. She knows more than we know. In the camp, the brute Griff rules. He who gives the bread has the power.
Let&apos;s not be so secretive, my good fellow. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;dying&lt;/i&gt; to show off those smouldering talents of yours. You just don&apos;t know how to handle them.
&apos;Threat de-escalated. Returning to primary task. Answer search running.&apos;
Patience. You must prove yourself worthy of such answers.
*Say that as far as you&apos;re concerned, he will be the next Divine.*
I suppose the ascension of the God King is proof that I&apos;ve got really bad taste in friends.
This... this doesn&apos;t smell right. Something else. But hungry... so hungry. I&apos;m gonna fill my belly full.
&lt;i&gt;...i do not die here... only you die here... i show you the truth... the terrible truth... the inescapable truth... that you are not enough... you have never been enough... you will never be enough...&lt;/i&gt;
I can see you, you know.
None
Set yourself free, Sebille. &lt;i&gt;Set us all free!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m not going to be of much help. If there&apos;s anything more you can do, I&apos;d be in your debt...
Is it done?
Did you really think I was planning to sail into one of the most dangerous places in Rivellon with a crew-for-hire and a rented boat?

*Rest your hand on the statue&apos;s wing.*
*Say you&apos;re intrigued. But what is it you get out of this deal, exactly?*
You&apos;re so cool. I never saw an elf before! Pops says you can read people&apos;s memories if you taste them. Is that true?
*Doesn&apos;t matter. All you need to do is to find her. Ask how.*
*There seems to be no escaping this weird bond, short of breaking off your own finger.*
Siva&apos;s got an eye for talent though. Maybe there&apos;s something to you.

M-mama?
Or something. I never took the time to learn how the average Rivellonian entertained themselves.
Fuligin black and so dense you can feel it tugging at the tendrils of all life and energy surrounding it.
*Smile back. Tell her you won&apos;t leave this place until you&apos;ve done what you came here to do.*
Pierces the enemy&apos;s Physical Armour and directly deals [1]. Sets Bleeding if the enemy has no Physical Armour.

The armour must be complete. Then the ancestor helps us. Helps &lt;i&gt;all.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you can&apos;t quite remember how it goes...*
...pardon, was that an invitation? Were you trying to initiate some form of mating ritual?
With that out of the way, I am sure you&apos;ve prayers to submit and aquaintances to greet. My Paladins will see to any further concerns. Good-bye, now.
You keep those opinions to yourself - we&apos;ve had enough desertions as it is - veterans, disgruntled with the new leadership...
Scar first? Is that... Is that why you seek me?
One way or another, we&apos;ll slip past &apos;em. Just keep your head to the ground. You&apos;ll get more than an earful o&apos; dirt, I promise.
Preach!

The candle flame burns no more.
*Interject. She is a party to the death and destruction that has seized Arx!*
*Tell her you have enough friends. Sometimes, you need someone to bully.*
In the Meadows, we met a sick-looking bird.
&apos;twas worth a shot...
*Take her musings to another direction: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Unless I kill you?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
I didn&apos;t mean nothing by it, friend. Just commenting on the dwarf&apos;s legendary iron stomach. Some of my best friends are dwarves.

How wonderful! I can stand on two feet, and my larva cravings are almost gone!

Can&apos;t say I blame you. I don&apos;t want to appear disloyal, but as dwarven weddings go this one has a tad more blood than usual. A tad.
&lt;i&gt;There are others. His chosen. Yet I am no longer among them.&lt;/i&gt;
Where is the island? Tell me!
[NOBLE] *Suggest that someone of your stature can put him out of business in a hurry.*
[JESTER] *Blow a raspberry.*
The Red Prince returned to the Empire, to a hero&apos;s acclaim -
You hear their voices as one; one mind, one thought. And it&apos;s your name they incant, as if the word itself were magic.
*Her eyes closed, the tiger mumbles to herself. If you listen closely you will hear...*
*At the mention of his name, Leya whimpers softly. Duggan glances at her with concern before turning back to you.*
That could have gone better. I&apos;ll try a different order.
You don&apos;t think so? You don&apos;t find that moment - when life and death weigh equally on the scales - just fascinating?
*The swaying toy sports a grin so evil, it might have spawned from the Void itself. But it&apos;s not the smile that disturbs you most; it&apos;s the ominous ticking of the mechanism beneath.*
Please, bring them all back from the brink.
*The sword slides clear of its scabbard, and its tip is levelled at your throat.*
I&apos;d never do such a thing. Never.
*Insert some regular drudanae into one of the slots and inhale from a hose.*
The princely lizard is embroiled in some Ancient Empire intrigue.
Alexandar has been spotted alive - most likely on the island we&apos;re looking for.
Holy coyote. The Black Ring&apos;s operatin&apos; from right in Justinia&apos;s court. Their spy&apos;s been bendin&apos; her ear, drivin&apos; the strife. She ain&apos;t just workin&apos; for her own gain - but for theirs.
Some things are meant to lie dormant. I&apos;m not sure this isn&apos;t one of those things.
*The brume upon the glass spins and whirls, but no face appears. The owner must be busy... or dead.*
We have travelled some time together, Shield. There were times when I... when I very nearly lost heart. My research... so much of it has led to naught. At times I fear I am no closer to stopping the Acorn than when I started.
Oh, I just love when random adventurers come to play hero. It&apos;s almost like they think fairy-tales are &lt;i&gt;real!&lt;/i&gt;
*A vivid and at times even accurate description of the Voidwoken Drillworm.*
With the rise of Adramahlihk, Demon Divine, Lohse could no longer resist. She became his thrall. Though her fans kept her music alive, Lohse would never sing again.
Physical Armour reduction
*Amid the soundless air of this alien world, a phantom-like figure awaits you.*
Shanova is the one for you then - her blades are as quiet as they are sharp, and she&apos;s not opposed to a little magic to help get the job done.
...the water rises and falls on Lord Kemm&apos;s command...
*Grab him by the throat and get ready. It&apos;s time for some creative interrogation.*
*Ask if the magic word is &apos;bad&apos;, &apos;dwarf&apos;, or perhaps &apos;cave&apos;.*
I should&apos;ve known. Someone, over here!
Before the Paladin coup, the Magisters had been investigating the disappearance of numerous prisoners from their cells.
*Say you haven&apos;t heard from Atusa. Perhaps it&apos;s best if you went to find her.*
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him you are the Red Prince.*

There is no curse in this world that I fear more than this, and no foe that I fear less than death.
And of course I&apos;d think of you. Of the adventures we had and the night we shared: that wondrous expression of joy when all was at its darkest.
&lt;i&gt;Do you mind? &lt;/i&gt;I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a puddle somewhere outside for you to play in.
[VILLAIN] *Kill him. That&apos;ll solve the problem.*
[RED PRINCE] *Say few things are as sad as a broken sword. Ask if that rapier is important to him in some way.*
