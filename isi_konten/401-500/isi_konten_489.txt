I don&apos;t plan to spend a moment longer here than is &lt;i&gt;strictly &lt;/i&gt;necessary.
Can you hear me, Fulton? Do something - &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;. Give me a sign!
Dear me, you&apos;re a miracle worker. I&apos;ll take it from here.
Mouthy ones, aren&apos;t they Ifan? Must&apos;ve been a &lt;i&gt;long &lt;/i&gt;journey here.
I was like you once: a lost soul driven by instinct from the bowels of Fort Joy. There have been others. They tried to make it back to the mainland, but were never heard of again. I chose to stay.

Adept Battlemage
But... I&apos;ve gotta keep a loyal crew about me. They&apos;ve gotta have my back jus&apos; like I&apos;ve got theirs. The thing is... seems like you&apos;re more liable to sink a dagger in my back than defend it. Got enough finks to fend off. I don&apos;t need to grow that list more.
I&apos;ll keep distractin&apos; em.
Min Joph
Keep our... guest... alive. Pain only - no mutilation... until the master comes.
*She turns one eye on you. Raises the brow above it.*
Blessed Fire Cloud
Fascinating. The histories are &lt;i&gt;wildly &lt;/i&gt;incomplete. But now I have a better picture of how Anathema came to be.
I await but your word. &lt;i&gt;Master.&lt;/i&gt;
Impressive... not many people notice my little secret.
A dishevelled dwarf barred our way to the cellar.
*Give him what he asks for.*
I landed on the island, in search of the Mother Tree.
*He looks up from his work and grins.*
*Reassure her: you&apos;ll get her out of here if you can.*

Report back to Dorian Gall.
*The tree-form spirit slowly, oh-so-slowly, becomes aware of you. When he speaks it&apos;s low and slow; he grumbles as if in discomfort or in pain.*
*Tell him you wish to work &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; others, not against them. Surely you do not need to be a tyrant to succeed?*
Hmm. I take. I sit. Brood brood. Marge will wake up later. Brood, brood, brood.
Ugh. No, thank you. I was interested in being owed a favour by a shiny new &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;, not some emperor of the realm.
The tigers fly, the leopards lie, and you... and you... Oh! But I know you, don&apos;t I? I have seen you in the night. The murderer of memory... Just a dream, of course. Just a dream.
*The witch&apos;s eyes are closed, her mouth whispering a prayer to the God King.*
*You&apos;re going to keep the peace. The races of this world are more powerful than ever - things will be... tense.*
No. Your soul must grow bigger still; your inner self become a vaster expanse so that it may house divinity.
Come on over for a touch of magic.
To get past the Path of Blood, we need to place the Source-filled amulet in a hidden nook, then read from the Scroll of Atonement.

*The White Magister swiftly pivots towards you and draws her blade.*
*Tell him to hold up. Is he calling upon the spirits of the graveyard to sacrifice their souls to you?*
*Bow your head. Is hollow vengeance really what he wants? Is this the person he wants to be?*
We&apos;ll see how silly you feel when the Cap&apos;n gets his hands around your throat.
*The spirit scowls at you.*
*Your neck involuntarily wrenches forward. Your eyelids pin open around their sockets. The thing is throwing its weight around once more.*

You&apos;re a far better healer than I am... thank you, for your efforts...
How... erm... &lt;i&gt;sad. &lt;/i&gt;I guess.
Fine. But you can&apos;t just ignore Deathfog and pretend it&apos;s going to go away on its own. When the time comes to act, you&apos;ll need a crew. And it seems to me you&apos;ve got a pretty good one.
I may be a world-class fool to think I can change Mack&apos;s mad thinking. But I get pleasure in knowing the day comes where I can stare into his beady eyes and gloat, &apos;I told you so&apos;.

*Declare that you&apos;re going to find a way to save him.*
We&apos;ll see about that.
Come close to the edge as you can, friend!
I have nothing to say to you. Think twice in future, before you urge violence against others.
*Holding a bloodied hand over his bleeding belly, Stingtail stands before you a broken mess, quivering with fear and pleading miserably to spare his life.*
Again to try?
Put your weapons away. I don&apos;t warn you again.
*Look at her expectantly. The word doesn&apos;t ring a bell.*
*Oh no, explain your interest is practical, not artistic. You just need a simple device to help you rip the faces from corpses and you&apos;ll be on your way.*
I see it, clear as the night sky hangin&apos; over a still sea. He plucked his sister from the Royal Guard&apos;s clutches. They fled the kingdom for Driftwood. Looks like he got some... er, I should say, had a &lt;i&gt;romantic dalliance &lt;/i&gt;with a lizard, upstairs in the tavern.

Be on your guard.
Two-Handed Tree Axe
Alright then, I&apos;ll - wait - the key&apos;s missing... dammit, I must have dropped it here someplace...

I stand ready.
*Suddenly, her eyes cloud to an unnatural black. Greyish veins run down her face, and her mouth tightens into a cruel sneer.*

One of us consumed the Source of Brother Robert&apos;s spirit, ending his control over the lever that controls the inner chamber of the vault.
*Ask if he knows whether any White Magisters sailed in recently.*
Nothing yet. But keep searching; we&apos;ll find him.
Don&apos;t be disgusting, I hardly know you.
You must put away your weapons. This is your last warning.
Options
He has given me much; now, I have given to him, and he has come. I am ready for his gift, and his sanction.
Lord Arhu comes to mind. Perhaps he&apos;s been nearby.
The half-breed elf must set our course - speak with her, and we can leave.
*Demand a reward.*
[NOBLE] *Tell him you&apos;d be enjoying the rewards of your forefathers&apos; work.*
If V-Sync is enabled, the refresh rate of the monitor is the highest possible value. A lower value can improve performance on old computers, or battery life on laptops.
[UNDEAD] *Die? Chuckle to yourself; been there, done that...*
*Sigh* Why couldn&apos;t you just have listened? Why couldn&apos;t you have just done as you were told? This will all be so much messier than it needed to be.
One cartload of purging sticks for a pile of dead brothers? This&apos;d better be worth it...
All right, &lt;i&gt;fine. &lt;/i&gt;Believe me when I say you&apos;ll be well rewarded. I suppose I can afford it better than I can afford an enemy at this particular moment.
I respect your mettle, Sourcerers. You steal my ship, kill my bishop, and force me to take flight. But I fear you&apos;ve chosen the wrong side of history.

Let&apos;s play a different kind of game then, shall we?
From death let me be death.
[JESTER] *Tell him you have to head off.*
*The cultist was told to follow the sigils to his trial of loyalty. He had to bring a fire rune to fill the &apos;dragon&apos;s mouth&apos;.*
Inglorious.
Well I think you&apos;re a mean little mole man with hairy ears and a dumb face! And I don&apos;t want to play with you ANYWAY!
Get used to it! The time of Septa the Ineffable has come. All will be peasants compared to me and my glorious Source powers - those that I allow to live, anyway...
What do you mean, &apos;what do I mean&apos;? I mean just what I say: I had a very actual &lt;i&gt;empire&lt;/i&gt; that I &lt;i&gt;lost&lt;/i&gt;.
I think we should go home. Come on, Ben. Thank you, mister lizard. Bye-bye.
You mean to say you... escaped?! Crawled yer way out o&apos; the belly of the beast? Crikey!
*Demand she reveal her Lord&apos;s intentions. You need answers!*
And you react to me with this... this &lt;i&gt;anger&lt;/i&gt;. This &lt;i&gt;hatred&lt;/i&gt;. It defies logic. It defies explanation.
