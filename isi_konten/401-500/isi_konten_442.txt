Will one of us get to the Wellspring and ascend to Divinity?
But I know this place well. I could lead you to its likely location. In turn, you would find a path straight out of this fort! My freedom for yours - what say you?
Battle Source Puppet
*Threaten to consume his Source and deny him the God King&apos;s presence if he doesn&apos;t talk.*
You saw that person I was speaking to just teleport, didn&apos;t you? I thought I was losing my wits for a moment!
Alright. Karon here can lead the way to Lucian.
Keeping tabs on those walking in and out. Lizard dreamer, spotted outside the gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ignore. Her head’s in the clouds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shady traveller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;He’s digging around for something. Watch close.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some ragtag adventurers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make sure they don’t cause trouble&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shady traveller update: dug up some dragon-bone boots, ran off with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Masked Servant is on it. Kill orders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the Servant ended up in the lizard&apos;s pyre with the traveller. Useless thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Send the cleanup crew later.&lt;/i&gt;
Lohse&apos;s soul is buried very deeply, deeper than ever before; Adramahlihk may never allow her to resurface again.
Dead White Magister
*Commiserate with him.*
*Admit you like to splash the pain around...*
...and also poses a new one.
I&apos;m not myself, Yarrow girl. I&apos;m sorry, darling.
A blade stained with the blood of dozens of Black Ring victims.
Flaming Tongues Scroll
Now you&apos;ll see how the Black Ring take care of business...
*The Magister moans in pain.*
It saddens me to say there are a number of deaths to mourn, but no doubt we all rejoice at the survival of the nobles. After all, a mere clerk is so easily replaced, wouldn&apos;t you say?
*Tell the dwarf to pull himself together. The Magisters aren&apos;t that big of a threat.*
*Boast that you not only found the tinkerer, you killed him too.*
*Nod enthusiastically, playing along.*
*The hulking  warrior&apos;s eyes dart about in panic, but his voice is loud and strong, even if it does not quite match the movement of his lips.*
I see the good in you, kin. I see your faith. I see your strength.
*The spirit hovers before you. It looks into your eyes and reaches out a hand of smoke and gossamer - silently begging you to take it.*
*Your eyes close. Death&apos;s shadows lift; rain becomes sun. Whatever fear this graveyard provoked is now bathed in brilliant light.*
Bone Crawler&apos;s Vengeance
*Ask about this &apos;Big Tomorrah&apos;. Where can you find her?*
Gawin will meet us somewhere quiet, and then we&apos;ll teleport each other out of here.
*The guard&apos;s breath catches. He squeezes his eyes shut, blinking away the pain. When he speaks it&apos;s in a low whisper.*
*The Scion twitches in sudden rage, and her armour &lt;i&gt;uncoils&lt;/i&gt; as if made of living vines.*
Inside a container ([1])
Toy Sword
There is no slaying the demon while this place remains. We need to act.
*Shrug and draw your weapon. If he&apos;d rather die than help you, then so be it.*
Pardon, but I await another.
I am Alexandar the Great Divine Bishop and I spell you, Sourcerer!
Void-touched Crawler
The nights here are long and lonely, but I often listen to my mistress Gratiana speak of days long gone. The heydays of Braccus Rex. Perhaps she will tell you her tales as well.
Really? You... you would?
But none of all &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;matters now! Now I&apos;ve got new enigmas to ponder, new questions to answer!
Source weapons? Here? No wonder the fish are rancid! By the Divine, someone will suffer for this treachery.
*Keep him on tenterhooks for a moment, then... relax. Shake your head and walk away.*
Cakaw?!
Who. Are. You?
I can still hear him now, the crusty old cad:
Shrine to Amadia
Stay away from the thief.
*Ask her to tell you about this &apos;Covenant&apos; once more.*
*You thought she&apos;d never ask.*
WHERE&apos;S IT GONE, EY?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH IT?!
The Demon Divine desired ever more power.
Away from me, demon! It is a terrible miracle that a heart as cold as yours manages to beat!
[NOBLE] *Tell her there&apos;s &lt;i&gt;nothing &lt;/i&gt;out of your league.*
*...a transparent chrysalis. The blue butterfly within looks ready to break free.*
[IFAN] *Laugh and say that sneaking&apos;s always been the &lt;i&gt;safest&lt;/i&gt; bet for you.*
Tentacle Lash
*Tell him that you needed others to stay alive.*
You dullard. You lack conviction. The doors remain closed to you.
[1]% chance to vaporise ground surfaces into cloud surfaces
Destroy the pillars. Go on. DO IT.
Go take your company elsewhere. And don&apos;t come back.
Oh you. You are an eassssssssy one to fool...
*Surely she means Braccus Rex. Tell her he&apos;s dead: she doesn&apos;t need to serve him anymore!*
*As you roam, the human apes turn away from you - all but one. One smiles. One opens his arms. One says he&apos;ll take you home. Braccus Rex.*
The Black Bull
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you, Fane. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
*And - of course - he does, pulling you down to lie on the ground beside him.*
Awrite! Right glad Lohar ain&apos;t left us here to wither.
*Lash out with your foot as he walks by, knocking him to the ground. He didn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;think he was going to survive this, did he?*
*Try to dispel the vision.*
[JESTER] *Claim that you&apos;re Lord Arhu&apos;s new attendant. You&apos;ve just finished cleaning his quarters.*
*Ask what you get out of the deal.*
*Bid him farewell.*
We&apos;ll go home. We&apos;ll be safe. We won&apos;t have to fear again.
*Cry out for him to stop this. Now!*
Heart of the Mother Tree
*Give her your blessing and leave.*
We broke the seal of the Blazing Sculpture, revealing a way into a hidden vault.
Seen a, eh, &lt;i&gt;ben-Mezd?&lt;/i&gt;
A Dwarven wand crafted from Driftwood timber and bound with thongs of Arxian leather.
Tavern 02
[SOLDIER] *Tell Dallis to prepare for battle. You have faced beasts mightier than her!*
*Tell him you&apos;re no Magister - and he&apos;s in deep you-know-what.*
[RED PRINCE] *Nod and say you know a succubus when you see one.*
...monsters... crawl the ocean floor... better to die on the beach...
You know what I mean, you vile serpent! Now leave me be - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
The note, stiff with dried blood and river water, is crinkled and creased from being held tight in the dead elf&apos;s hand.
*Tell the gruesome slime ball that you don&apos;t understand it, and it had better keep out of your way.*
Blacksmith
Ah, it&apos;s a sad story about a lover who left me out cold. Name &apos;a Mindya Bisnes.
I was, but as you can tell I&apos;m quite cursed with kindness.
I hope you change your mind, Sebille. You who loves her freedom above all.
*Say there will be plenty of time to discuss it later. Off we go.*
What are you doing, eh? Trying to get the drop on me? Sneak up and slit my throat?!
Perhaps. But you must realise that until a short while ago, the very existence of the House of Shadows was a mystery to us. If this thing of darkness steps into the light, it must be desperate - and desperate means dangerous.
Mountain - Trail
And? Are they dead?
&lt;i&gt;...you are not the equal of my father...&lt;/i&gt;
Ah well. Some things just can&apos;t be helped.
No matter.
*The soldier starts, backing away quickly, never taking his eyes off the faintly-glowing flames.*
*He chuckles, and pokes the inside of his cheek with his tongue.*
*The feeling expands outwards and upwards, stealing your strength and sapping your will. Your heart hardens and your knees go weak.*
Thunderstorm Scroll
I am... I am not...
With the aid of the Demon Divine and his vast demonic armies,
On the Ropes
*Nod. Is there nothing more he requires?*
Oh, uhhhh, OK. Sorry I asked.
He&apos;s known as the Sallow Man - my father faced him in battle, during the Great War. He&apos;s a wicked creature; a master of illusions who hides in the shadows, and sends others to do his bidding.
*He stirs...*
Hur-hur.
The fluorescent liquid in this vial looks more radioactive than potable, but its effect on one&apos;s perception is undeniable.
I couldn&apos;t save Gareth. I should bring Leya proof of his demise.
The burden falls on you, if you&apos;re willing to bear it. Only you can save us.
Have you come to a decision? My dreams do not say if you will be our salvation or our downfall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*She looks over the wreckage with a grimace.*
*Ask why he&apos;s trapped down here.*
What is it.
Wedding Invitation
We offered to sort out their Voidwoken problem.
Don&apos;t speak to the prisoner!
The Magisters have a lot to answer for.
Yes, you paid once. And you crossed my bridge once.
All of the pigs are dead. We can no longer help them.
She is not only a Scion, but a precious child. She &lt;i&gt;cannot &lt;/i&gt;be lost.
*Say you&apos;re from the House of War.*
We helped Hannag, but she could not help us - we have already reached our full potential. We are the masters now.
You don&apos;t scare me. Even &lt;i&gt;with &lt;/i&gt;those crazy eyes of yours. Say goodnight.
Sur Brett
*chuckle* Calm yourself, Marcus. You don&apos;t know me, but I know you. The rebellion lives.
An iron key marked with the emblem of the Magisters.
...the crimson bream! Ah yes, it&apos;s coming back to me know. A fierce creature, quite the little predator.
How much would it take to change your mind?
You cannot bribe your way to freedom. Pay for your crimes!
Thassa spirit. How about just one more? Penny for a lost dog? Dog&apos;s gone, after all.
You can always count on a dwarf to get things done! Looks like the Lady Vengeance has life in her, and I can&apos;t say I&apos;m keen to keep floating to nowhere. Let&apos;s move!
Lucian the Divine
Mordus. The priest. Not... what he claims to be.
Toxic Tannins
[1] increases the rate at which you gain experience by [2]%.
*He raises his hand to hit you, but with a sudden look of dejection leaves it hanging in the air.*
Never thought I&apos;d be relieved to die like that!
I&apos;m Malady, as I said. I&apos;m here to help you get off this island. And &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;what gets some of us get out of bed each morning. What do you make of that?
In the sewers beneath Arx, we found a Deathfog machine. With the turn of the wheel, we unleashed Deathfog on the city.
You&apos;ve learned the Bless skill, which allows you to Bless existing surfaces, clouds, items, and characters. Using it, you can also cleanse Cursed status.
GOOD things occur. Very good things! Just o&apos;en the chest!
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;COAL FEATHER&lt;/b&gt;.*
*He nods, a faraway look in his eyes.*
*Try to force open the hatch with brute strength.*
For the dragon helm, see the blue cabinet: 2-3-2-1-1-3.
Better to be dead than beholden to a demon. Better to be drawn and quartered and buried alive...
You know what difference it makes! It might get me back in their good graces, if... if they think I helped them...
*Say that you were happy to help.*
Come, come, darlings. Time to die for Papa.
Encouraged
I&apos;ll do what I do best: hold things together. Those that remain still need a chief, so I&apos;ll attend to whatever needs attending to. I have no more surprises up my sleeve; I dare say you&apos;ve had enough.
We all like to say that, don&apos;t we...
*Shake your head - you found the wand elsewhere.*
*Say that you&apos;re no Sourcerer! You&apos;re a Magister agent, infiltrating the Seekers.*
Letter
Changing Figure
Strife does not unite us - it scatters us. I tell them, yet they do not hear.
