A shadow approaches. It threatens to consume all it shrouds. Even the unliving. Even you.
All we know is that the House of Shadows seeks to kill you. Their motives are as obscure as their very existence, but I surmise it has something to do with another obscure existence:
*He holds the apple to your lips. It feels not cool and dry, but warm and wet. &lt;i&gt;He squeezes... &lt;/i&gt;Liquid, warm and coppery, fills your mouth, drips down your throat, spills onto your chin.*
Carolan Fluffinster, at the service of the realm, sir! Ready to follow the whistles to the front lines of the war! Sir!
Dazzler Trap
The curse has lifted! The dread voice of the king is gone! You have set me free!
Union between the Red Prince and Sadha will engender the race of dragons. Some guys have all the luck.
With the Source released to the world,
Human Torso
...but I wouldn&apos;t want to give him the satisfaction! I can&apos;t have him know that he can still get under my skin! Leave me, servant - tell your master that I refused to see you.
A child&apos;s sense of good and evil makes you your own demonic advocate. God&lt;i&gt;woken,&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;unworthy!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say he is right. Moving ahead now would be too risky.*
Very good. Then it&apos;s time we touch down in Arx and take back what Dallis stole.
I can see you are up to something. Cut it out.
*Shadows of the past cloud his bright eyes. He no longer looks at you, but through you.*
Why, you&apos;re looking a bit more chipper! Yes... looks like that collar fits you snugly enough. Nice bit of work, even if I do say so myself.
Lonely? I wouldn&apos;t think so. I went from life in the regiment, to life in the pack, to life on the road with you. I haven&apos;t had &lt;i&gt;time &lt;/i&gt;to be lonely...
The Magisters have a Shrieker up there. It killed my friend. May have killed that Magister too. I wouldn&apos;t tangle with it alone. &apos;fact, I wouldn&apos;t tangle with it at all.
*She backs away and is Zorl-Stissa again, in her own godly guise once more.*
Mend Metal Scroll
When they learned of the Divine&apos;s deal with the demon, they gathered together, opened a portal, and left Rivellon forever. To where, no-one knows, but sometimes the trees whisper a name: &apos;Nemesis.&apos; The elves may have made a terrible mistake.
Yes, of course. They told me all about you. Oh, they jabber something frighteningly!
Yes. An advocate of most vulgar, most repellent &lt;i&gt;deception&lt;/i&gt; that seeks to bend the will with feeble force.
*Suggest that if he were to turn a blind eye to your escape, you&apos;d make it worth his while...*
A little bit of the heavens from the depths of the ocean. Makes you think, eh?
[RED PRINCE] *Say that you are of royal blood. Helping those beneath you is the least you could do.*
*Decline. You&apos;re better off by yourself.*
Argh!
Help me!
*Forktongue&apos;s lips curl into a smile.*
*The Doctor turns to you after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact you made.*
That was amazing! I&apos;ve never seen anyone stand up to a Voidwoken before, let alone come through in one piece!
*She sighs deeply and rolls her eyes.*
Well, that &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;sound bad.
Poisoned Food
I suppose I should leave this be, then. Farewell.
Oh good! I&apos;m off then. I&apos;m going to be cream and find my mum!
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? A candied salamander?
*Demand to know what she just did.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve found the Sanctuary of Amadia.*
*Spits.* Not amongst Paladins, it&apos;s not.
This creature is as blank as a silent monk. Dark magic at work.
You won&apos;t know what hit you.
*Admire their choice of camping spot, and ask where they&apos;re headed.*
If I didn&apos;t know any better, I&apos;d think you were taking a shine to me - you&apos;re hardly out of my presence lately...
Gaze into the gem, my wild and lovely dwarf.
Ah, yes. One of Mari&apos;s heroes passes. Come on through, but... mind the smell.
Hah! Removed your collar, dog? Look at you - so pink and soft and weak! I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
Sanders, the toy-maker. He built the Path of Blood for Lucian. I believe the amulet was kept upon his person, and the Scroll of Atonement in a desk, upstairs from his shop.
I saw you atop a tower. I reached out to address you, but after that, all went... blank.
Yes. Yes, I will.
Here we are: The Nameless Isle. And here I thought &apos;Malady&apos; was unimaginative...
Physical Immunity Aura
*Tell her that you found the egg, but it broke.*
She&apos;s going to make it... thank the Seven.
*Suddenly, the tip of a dagger presses against your throat.*
Really? Do you think so?
There&apos;s was a big reception one night. The ridiculous kind, where all the ladies wear dresses and all the men wear finery. Everyone looks starched. Everyone acts starched.
Voting In Progress
*Grab the dwarf by her cowl. She &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;tell you where Mordus is.*
Replaced with a ghostly image of itself, the Second Passion of Lucian seems to have been stolen.
*Your body convulses with Tir-Cendelius&apos; displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile grows at the sight of your agony.*
Such an oil spill, a mighty slick indeed!
I spent a whole year in the company of demons, every night atop the White Library tower of my palace. It was my great study of existence. It was my supreme joy, even if...
Belt of Power
Something... delicious.
[DWARF] *Tell him you&apos;re just a person. You wouldn&apos;t harm him.*
Heeheehee! A pampered cow! Heeheehee!
*Click* Eep?
*The dwarf looks at you in horror for a moment before he bursts into tears. You smirk and walk away as he sobs into his beard.*
Kemm always liked ME the best. He gave me LOTS of treats like that. Those others, with their fancy names... he never gave THEM treats like ME!
Double Axe
You took your time. The Magisters are searching the place and Lohar needs to get his stuff out of the basement if he doesn&apos;t want to lose it.
By my branches. Who needs the Great Acorn when you have weapons like thisâ€¦
*The innkeeper&apos;s steely eyes dart around the bar nervously; she seems preoccupied.*
No... no...
&lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;the Master.
I suppose you&apos;re right. But that doesn&apos;t mean we haven&apos;t been dealt an unfortunate blow. Still - it does me no good to dwell on what I cannot undo.
*Ask what the disagreement is.*
The trapped undead is now fully dead.
Large Thunder Rune
They&apos;re workin&apos; on a cure for ya even now. Got some good leads, so I hear! *Haw!* You can trust Dallis to take care of it. And once you&apos;re cured, your life will start again.
End turn
*Ifan claps the man on the back, and turns to leave.*
Wits
That was... that was amazing. He&apos;s scared. I feel it. Oh my gods, I &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;it. This is it!
I... thought the nightmare had ended. I thought we were safe. Can I ever be forgiven? Should I be?
Stingtail. How he came to regret the actions he performed that day.
*You find a mirror in your pocket. You open it and stare into the black glass. The most beautiful woman that you have ever seen looks back at you. You smile...*
The damn thing won&apos;t come off!
I owe you an apology, Shield. At the start of our journey, I wouldn&apos;t have believed a &lt;i&gt;dwarf  &lt;/i&gt;would lead me to the discovery that would save us all.
*Effie is bartering with another client at the moment. Best try calling for her again later.*
and wander alone amongst the dying stars.
You&apos;re a cheap one, aren&apos;t you? You can&apos;t shut my mouth with such a paltry sum.
My mind rejoiced. &lt;i&gt;Now for the body,&lt;/i&gt; I reasoned, so with a certain succubus I spent nights that would surpass your understanding.
Thank you. You&apos;re such a sweetheart.
Now? Now I&apos;m going to undo what the Knights have done.
The beggar is using a studded collar to torture his dog for profit.
Crafter&apos;s Kit
Perhaps someone else will see reason...
Hey, chief. We need to talk.
Cheapskate, are ya? Can&apos;t say that surprises me. Most humans I know are stingy with their purses.
One candle, one soul. It isn&apos;t my place to take all these lives.
Poisoned Club
[NOBLE] *Retort that of course you&apos;re alone - someone of your breeding has no business making friends in the wrong places.*
Summon Duna&apos;s Undertaker.
What&apos;s that, boy? What are you trying to tell me? Are you hungry? Do you want to play? Did someone fall down a well? Aww. You&apos;re so precious when you try to talk!
Keep your potions fresh and ready.
*A wave of rage washes over you as Jahan speaks the creature&apos;s name. The demon heard him. He heard him and he&apos;s furious.*
You don&apos;t seem to be the criminal I&apos;m looking for, but you&apos;re still a criminal. And criminals belong in prison.
*Sebille walks up to Roost: a massive man who&apos;s looming over a small elf, his hair a tangle of matted knots. Scars upon scars cross every inch of visible flesh, from his hands to his gnarled face.*
I... I can&apos;t fight. I&apos;m too weak... please...
*Her kisses go lower still. Your belly, and below. Her tongue all along your length.*
*An Ancestor? Ask if he means an elven spirit.*
Flee
*The shard responds with another sequence of unusual and ominous words. This language is beyond your comprehension.*
Innocent child - do you think they are not being promised the same power by their false gods? Do you think those brutes will even hesitate before striking you down?
*She starts to tremble, her eyes staring into the far distance.*
Your latest victim is your last, then. Prepare yourself!
*She falls quiet and stares at her bloody hands.*
Lord Arhu is the Keeper of the Cathedral. His duties are select - only he can approach the remains of the Divine, for instance.
Gold
Well... you&apos;re certainly worthy of worship. You look radiant, my dear.
*Leave the altar alone.*
*Be on your way.*
Consumed Corpse
Voidwoken turtles?! Oh dearie... me, no. No... that wouldn&apos;t be... my... style at all.
This very moment, Your Majesty; this very meeting is designed entirely to make up for my failure.
I smell the fog on you, dog-man. The fog of death. You were there, when all my kind were killed. It is &lt;i&gt;your fault&lt;/i&gt;.
Find Gareth.
I ought to continue what I&apos;m doing here, unless there was anything else...?&lt;br&gt;
He is not the Godwoken I expect. Few ferocious warriors bring an army.
&lt;i&gt;Failed&lt;/i&gt; attempts, remember? Hardly made me break a sweat, those lackeys of yours.
Toy Barrel
You never learn your lesson, do you? I gave you life.
Crippled status prevents target from walking or running.
Moving to reinforcement deployer!
*Start to think that this might actually be the whole truth and all of the truth.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve spoken with Murga and you&apos;re ready to fight.*
*Somewhat to your surprise Sebille doesn&apos;t recoil, but allows you to hug her.*
Quite simple, once you know the trick. You place a book onto the pile, and a hatch at the back of the fireplace is unlocked.
Rutoma Rivelleis
*Diplomatically say that he&apos;s entitled to his opinion.*
Get away from him, Sourcerer! That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;the Divine!&lt;/i&gt;
[SWORN] *Insist the Covenant is no lie. The God King will abide!*
*Agree. You will do as he says.*
There we have it, don&apos;t we, dear? The final die has been cast and it&apos;s come up wanting.
