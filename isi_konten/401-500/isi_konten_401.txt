Oooh, thanks mister! I&apos;ll go find her then! Mum! Mum! I&apos;m coming!
No! I can trust only my own kin!
Arran gave us a treasure key - and a warning: it takes a champion to claim the prize.
*Offer your condolences. To lose his people is tough, but his daughter too...*
*Fight back against the vision.*
*You notice two other men in the room. Note they look well armed.*
Slowed
Hard feelings it is.
... all your eyes... all your eyes... in the dark, in the cold...
I am Baran Levere... In the halls I&apos;ll be Baran Levere...
*Samadel presses her lips together. Disbelief and indignation shine from the narrowed eyes she trains on you.*
Venture no farther. Only death lies beyond.
Yes. Yes, so do I.
Why, I travelled back to civilisation and had myself a long, luxurious bath.
*You fall to your knees, breaking eye contact. Rhalic drags you back to standing with one hand and slaps you in the face. Hard.*
*The girl grimaces in concentration. Her fingers spasm. For just a moment, she extends all digits on one hand, and two more on the other hand.*

Fire Essence
offering them shelter from hatred and fear.
Ah, yes. You do seem to draw the wrong kinds of attention, do you not? I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know your little friends, though - my associates tend to be more... clandestine.
Please, allow me to invite you to join me in my private chambers for further intellectual discourse...
*Take your leave.*
I need to ascend.
Food: Produce
Heart of the Matter
You&apos;ve sacrificed the world, you cretin. And for what? The favour of the &lt;i&gt;God King?&lt;/i&gt; It won&apos;t last. He&apos;ll see you in the same light that he does me, sooner or later.
Find Sadha.
Pile of Corpses
Right. I have the information I came for. He&apos;s all yours now.
Were the circumstances &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;different, I would indeed agree.
*Examine the statue.*
Lovely. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me... &lt;i&gt;I must work.&lt;/i&gt;
Leaving Duggan back there feels wrong. He should be here. I miss him so much...
Poisoned and - ungh - attacked. I feel as delicate as my intestines...
Magical Hammered Scale Helmet
I was freed of one covenant, only to be enslaved once more.
Accidentally buried in a human grave, the ghost of the lizard Vilnx Creeva wants his remains burned in the Eternal Fire.
*The man&apos;s face is a mask of anguish. You hear him murmur snatches of prayer to himself... a prayer for the dead of Arx, the victims of the Deathfog.*
*Ask what&apos;s going on.*
There are rumours that some have been found at the Blackpits - an oil field on Reaper&apos;s Coast.
...
Few have shown my kindness in my days. My dark and wretched days. My black, black days. Thank you.
*The arrowhead points the way forward.*

*Shrug. These things happen.*

[SEBILLE] *Tell him there will be blood. Blood is the sole certainty.*
Six days later he was stabbed to death with a mutton fork.
They feed me... horrible things. Meat. From... from people. I don&apos;t want to eat it! But they do something to it that makes it... irresistible.
Potent Enlightenment Herbmix
Oh, would you? Such kindness from one still uninitiated!
Stop that! Hey! Everyone out! Troll-time! TROLLS! &lt;i&gt;TROLLS!&lt;/i&gt;
Magister Julian sent us for Lohar&apos;s head.
Evade!
It&apos;s rare to see her likeness outside of the Dwarven Halls.
Next Level [1]: +[2]% damage and +[3]% Dodging.
&apos;Here lies The Timorly, famed trappist.&lt;br&gt;A master of the pitfall, a craftsman of the snare.&lt;br&gt;Died peacefully in his sleep,&lt;br&gt;A wire noose around his neck.&apos;
I followed Alexandar. My loyalty is to him. More of us should be by his side, but not all would leave their posts.
You are nothing. A puppy dogging my heels. Your skull so easy to crush beneath my boot.
An elven ancestor tree. Even I can&apos;t deny the beauty.

*Tell him he&apos;s right - he&apos;ll need that sword.*
*Tell her there&apos;s no sense in passing a blessing to a dead god.*
*The Voidwoken tightens its grip until you feel blood seeping from your punctured flesh. Time passes - minutes, perhaps, or hours. Then, the talons release you. First air and wind. Then, a thud.*
Nice of you to make it so easy on us. Usually we have to go sniff your lot out, one by one.
Why are you egging me on? You&apos;re a villain and a cad, and I won&apos;t let you coop me up in conversation a moment longer... so cluck off!
buried under several tons of fish
I&apos;m a wabbit.
Master Fane! I never thought I&apos;d see you again. It&apos;s been so long since our time together in your library.
With you, &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt;. Let&apos;s go...
We&apos;ve used Source for thousands of years. We have used it to heal - to grow. How can it be that it suddenly summons these... these horrors from the Void? And when will Alexandar ascend to Divinity? We cannot continue like this.
I wouldn&apos;t trust them as far as I could roll them.
You swore. You SWORE! You took my favour and now you refuse to repay it. Behold the fate of the oath-breaker. Behold the fate of the heretic. &lt;i&gt;Behold the fate of the THIEF!&lt;/i&gt;
Distinctive Blood Rose

The prisoner is Windego. She has lost faith in the God King, and wants her freedom.
How much longer?
Back, bacaw?
*...a golden chest covered with ornate runes, and overflowing with emeralds.*
It seems I can&apos;t use that right now.
Huh? Leave me be. She&apos;s watching! *Ahem!*
*A great surge of water engulfs you. It spreads and soaks the land... not water after all, but &lt;i&gt;blood &lt;/i&gt;- the blood of armies. The blood of &lt;i&gt;lizards&lt;/i&gt;. The earth grows red and sodden.*
Lord Kemm executed one of his own paladins for disobedience in battle.
*Squeeze her hand. Of course you will.*
&lt;i&gt;Sebille.&lt;/i&gt;
Very well. I am done with this world.
*Back away.*
If you&apos;d arrived a little later, you&apos;d be free to suffer your own fate here once they find you. I&apos;m sure Dallis would&apos;ve loved to watch your tail wriggle beneath her boot.
I never thought I&apos;d be smellin&apos; the sea breeze again. Figured we&apos;d all be shufflin&apos; around as Silent Monks right now, so the air seems... extra sweet, if you get what I&apos;m saying. More Malady magical-ness, I&apos;m guessing.
Then death awaits you!
*Ask why it seems so gleeful at the thought of the gods&apos; demise.*
I gave you everything, and yet you would renounce me.
Give me your map. *Cough* I show you the way out. A secret. Dangerous. But it leads to freedom.
*Say you see. He&apos;s the one who&apos;s been hunting down Godwoken.*
Immune To Burning
Drained Wand
Goodbye, lad.
When you have both the charged amulet and the scroll, go to the Path of Blood. On the left side of the chamber, on a pillar near Lucian&apos;s statue, you should see a hidden mechanism. It will clear the way.
If you o&apos;en the chest, &apos;ad things will ha&apos;en. Not nice things. &apos;ad things. See those &apos;ul&apos;s? &apos;lants? The flora all around us, I &apos;ean to say. It&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;go off.&lt;/i&gt;
Poisoned Carrot
*The reaver wags a boney finger at you.*
*Point out that the tinkerer was innocent, but had to flee anyway. Doesn&apos;t he feel guilty?*
My generosity ends there, however. Please - see yourself out.
Welcome. Think you&apos;ll like today&apos;s &lt;i&gt;specials.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In darkest night, put on your mask,&lt;br&gt;And decant out one poison flask.&lt;br&gt;Into that murk then will absorb,&lt;br&gt;A fresh and juicy round Source orb.&lt;br&gt;Then at completion of your task,&lt;br&gt;In your hands:a &lt;b&gt;Cursed Poison Flask!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
So your excuse is that you were too &lt;i&gt;weak&lt;/i&gt; to know you were bein&apos; played? What a gods-damned &lt;i&gt;joke,&lt;/i&gt; Justinia.
Summon becomes immune to Earth damage and gains an additional Geomancer skill (depending on summon).
March on, stranger. I&apos;m busy killing Magisters.
Requisition for Magister Food Supplies
Maybe there was something to his obsession with yarrow. Perhaps it means some spark of his personality remained.
Bandit Dwarf Defender
Changes Incarnate&apos;s element to water, unlocking Restoration.
*You freeze again under the heat of her dark eyes, the energy of her so near to you.*
Are you certain?
Poison... damn nasty business. Give me a dagger-wielding assassin any day.
Frisk off.
I thought you&apos;d see things my way.
You were... in a cellar with the other Sourcerers. As everyone lay sleeping, your hunger gnawed and gnawed at you until you could stand it no longer.
You must see about getting that collar ripped off your neck, though - though I wouldn&apos;t know where you should even begin. With Leya gone...
*Nod. That seems quite sensible.*
*Samadel&apos;s focus and attention is wholeheartedly devoted to tending Han&apos;s leg.*
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him he should heed what he learned; he ought to avoid addressing his superiors directly.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell her you&apos;re just a soldier, trying to make their way in the world.*
He has escaped the island prison to which the Order confined him. A feat deserving a modicum of respect.
Invaluable? That lad&apos;s keen, but he&apos;s the worst archer I&apos;ve ever seen!
How did this happen...? I gave away a small fortune to the Cathedral and the schools a-and the poor on the streets. &lt;i&gt;I paid what was owed - I should be cleansed of my sins!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the Magister that you haven&apos;t seen anyone.*
Moving to bovine empathy simulator!
*Store the soul jar in your backpack.*
We met the murderer from the Merryweather; she was praying to an unnamed god. She called us sinners, then attacked us.
Workbench
&lt;i&gt;I scent Source on you...&lt;/i&gt;
[LIZARD] *Express surprise that she&apos;d show interest in a lizard.*
*Tell her you have a home already. Is this hers?*
It shakes me little now - all too little - but that first time, that first real kill... it was such stuff as nightmares are made on.
Open Sticky
Rabbit
Gotta get gone, but still feels like my head&apos;s been split open with a great axe.
Such an excellent question, but a bit premature, don&apos;t you think? We adhere to a certain decorum in this court. I am sure you understand, my prince.
*Say it&apos;s going fine and ask her what she&apos;s doing here.*
*She brightens and reaches for you.*
Let me know how you like them. I always value the feedback of my treasured customers!
[SEBILLE] *Give him an icy stare. Sebille.*
Primordial Oil Voidling
Some equipment is about to break
I&apos;m uneasy. This feels good, but it wouldn&apos;t be hard to lose control.
In return for your generous offering to your queen, I will tell you a little secret about the one downstairs. He accepted a promise - &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Promise - and now he wants to weasel his way out of it.
You&apos;re clearly no Magister. Pretty face coated in dirt. Haphazard garb. How&apos;d you come to be here?
Braccus was a horror, of that there is no doubt. He stripped this land of its Source and took it for himself, just as the Magisters do today.
Malevolence. Darkness. It hangs off you like an ill-fitting cloak, like a rancid second skin.
*What&apos;s going on here? Demand he identify himself.*
Claw Hammer
Ours has been a story for the ages, hasn&apos;t it. You were nothing but a two-bit minstrel playing host to a carousel of visitors, and I was... well. I was doing quite well. But now, I&apos;m even better.
*You&apos;re no-one&apos;s errand boy! Tell him where the barrel is. It&apos;s his responsibility; he can deal with it.*
I just turned away to refill my goblet, looked back, and he was... gone.
You&apos;ve taken your last victim, then. Prepare yourself!
I wish I was able to tell a different story. Alas...
*He quickly pushes you away, wipes his nose, and clears his throat.*
