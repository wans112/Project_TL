When it comes to graveyards, I&apos;m a kid in a candy shop. All sorts of goodies and gewgaws for the taking - and a bit of rousing conversation. If you know where to dig, that is.
Shielded
*Ask where she&apos;s going next.*
I am here because it is the only oasis open to me in this arid world. I need protection...
Oh, yes. Hmmm. Of course you have, prince of princes, yes. Indubitably. I need to parley with you further, sire. I do and do indeed.
Hullo again. That&apos;s twice now you&apos;ve saved my skin.
*Take another step.*
I see.

Poisoned deals poison damage over time.&lt;br&gt;Can target terrain to create ooze surface.&lt;br&gt;Damage dealt depends on your weapon&apos;s damage rating.
*A small smirk crosses his features before he tightens his lips and looks back at you, stern now.*
I suppose you heard of the disappearances around here, have you? Well the case has been solved, thanks to a Magister... or rather an &lt;i&gt;ex&lt;/i&gt;-Magister... it seems you elves have some uses after all...
I&apos;d say your guess is as good as mine, &apos;cept I&apos;ve got the sense not to ask any questions. Now you slither on, lizard. I&apos;ve enough scales to deal with.
Pain_Sh_3
But any betrayal can be forgiven. It is not too late. Not even for you.
&lt;i&gt;NOT&lt;/i&gt; what I was looking for. Now I&apos;ll bid you good day, bore.
*Pause. It can see... the &lt;i&gt;thing?*&lt;/i&gt;
*His disapproving gaze rests upon you for a moment... then moves on.*
Mu - murder?! I suggested no such thing! Now get out of my sight.
*Her forehead wrinkles with distaste and she purses her lips.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll think about it.*
Katie Woodpants
Oh, I&apos;ll take my goods, alright. But you don&apos;t get a second chance.
*Say you understand. It can&apos;t have been an easy choice.*
*The squirrel turns his nose up at you and turns away, but his cat seems more than happy to tag along, dragging its owner with it.*
*Bow and thank the squirrel for his service.*
I try to correct it. I fail. Maybe you are stronger than me.
Gotta die of something.
*With one graceful motion, the lizard throws down a tangled mass of vines for you to climb.*
*Tell Han you saw what happened to Verdas. Unpleasant, to say the least.*
A home? I had an empire. And when I ride the red tidal wave back to it and reclaim what was stolen from me, the reckoning will be felt across all of Rivellon.
*Tell her you&apos;ve never really experienced that; other people&apos;s feelings don&apos;t affect you much.*
*Her voice lapses into a soft whisper.*
Even as I speak, it has begun - our plans, our strategies, our records, all consumed by flames. And amidst the ash, another charred anonymous corpse in a city littered with them.
*Lambo tucks his tail between his legs and lowers his head. He&apos;s not a happy dog.*
*Rest your hand on the statue&apos;s wing.*
Don&apos;t think of the ugly now. Here I am, here you are; here we are.
I found you!
*With a few ripples of Source the wound closes, leaving behind but new scar tissue that effaces all trace of the hated word that was.*
Not much more than the paper told ya. But it&apos;s enough to know I&apos;ve gotta stop Justinia. She&apos;s got the rebellion in her sights. My comrades. My friends.
There is a matter I must attend to, however: my payment for all the stuff I&apos;ve done for you. That&apos;ll be...
Perceptive. Like most men behind bars, I&apos;m innocent. Like most of us here on the island, in fact. Aren&apos;t you like me? Looking for a way out?
*Tell him you&apos;re keeping the parts. You wouldn&apos;t want him anywhere near a weapon that powerful.*
Medium Flame Rune
*Shrug and bid him farewell.*
*Look over your shoulder to be sure you&apos;re not being watched. In a whisper, ask what he needs you to do.*
To harm something so rare, so defenceless... it would be a terrible sin. Keep the egg safe.
Your knuckles will rot to bone long before you break my resolve. Speak the password.
*He forms a fist around your hand and squeezes it so hard it feels like your bones will break.*
Seems they found what they were looking for. They found you, monkey-man! They found you! Ook! Ook! Hahahahahaha!
So be it. I hope I place my trust well.
No; I suppose the Red Prince is rather taller, isn&apos;t he. You&apos;re positively stunted. Sorry for the mix-up. House?
*Ask how many assassins he&apos;s had sent after him.*
So, even after all this time the traitor enjoys her reward for turning us over.
I&apos;ll be damned if I ever step foot on that island again. Don&apos;t care who I have to bury.
Be at ease, sister. We&apos;re safe now.
Maybe if we had a crowbar...
*Thank him for his service to the Seekers - and to all who have depended on him.*
Dwarf Pillar
*Drape your arms over his shoulders and lean in close. What if it is?*
*Shake your head. So it only got worse from there?*
*As the lost soul disintegrates, you watch the last fragments of consciousness dissipate from her despairing eyes.*
*Ifan clears his throat. Roost turns his face to you both - and roughly wrenches the elf&apos;s jaw toward you as well.*
The last time I obeyed Lucian, countless innocents died. Surrender my Source? &lt;i&gt;He should surrender his life.&lt;/i&gt;
[SCHOLAR] *Tell him you&apos;d be expanding your knowledge of the world through books.*

Lucian be praised! A friendly face emerges from the dust!

He died the day he met me.
Heh-heh-heh! Did I give you the illusion you have a choice? How &lt;i&gt;absurd&lt;/i&gt;.
*Groans*
&lt;i&gt;My one; my one...&lt;/i&gt;
I admit, I ate that bone.
I&apos;ve wanted you for so long. I&apos;ve wanted you &lt;i&gt;like this &lt;/i&gt;for so long.
Take a hint. You&apos;re not welcome round these parts.
[Within this fading, dog-eared text are stories of demons and darkness you know little about. Whether it is a true history or a retelling of old myths, you cannot say.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By creating war, discord and chaos, the Black Ring sought to feed the demon spirit in Janus&apos; unholy sword - to invite the sundered soul of the Lord of Chaos to return to Rivellon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None might guess the outcome of such tragedy. At best, we would all be conquered and enslaved by the Lord&apos;s minions. At worst, all the world may be returned to Primal Chaos: the endless, starless night that was here before the coming of the gods.
They don&apos;t call us &apos;dreamers&apos; for nothing, I&apos;m afraid. My purpose is to dream. And for that, I need to sleep. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me...
[JESTER] *Say the first word that comes to mind: Groomioh.*
*Inform her that she wasn&apos;t this man&apos;s protector; she was his captor.*
Such a beautiful place, such beautiful culture. I look forward to going back someday. Someday, when the roads are safe again...
Burning Witch
Who knows! What do hammers do but fall, right?
Buddy, for a penny you can sing him a love song and call him &apos;mummy&apos;.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
*Ask who the half-living prisoner is and why she&apos;s hanging by her hands.*
*Tell the kid that Ifan ben-Mezd is dead.*
Empyreo the Stalwart
*The royal guard&apos;s eyes widen as Beast approaches, and his calloused fingers reach towards the wolf insignia adorning his uniform.*
*Ask where that leaves you...*
We rescued Gareth from the Magisters. Where he&apos;ll go now, we do not now.

Dallis the Hammer is the finest general of the Divine Order. Adaptive and battle-tempered, she&apos;s forged many paths to victory.
*Say he doesn&apos;t look much like a &apos;Madam Zoor&apos;.*
*Tell him he can stay as long as he pulls his weight.*
*Amadia stretches out her hand, and you feel a warm glow spread through your bones. You feel... not &lt;i&gt;whole&lt;/i&gt;, but closer to it: as if a new corner of your spirit has been unlocked.*
Up to you! You know where I am if you think of anything...
Oh, sure you do! &apos;Come to me the night is long; sing for me, I&apos;ll sing along.&apos;
The Void is stronger than ever. A new Divine won&apos;t be enough. You need to go the Well of Ascension not to bathe in the Source of the Seven, but to &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; it. &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of it.

*Lie. You&apos;ve never seen one before.*
*You can feel your nail slide through his eye as if through a hardboiled egg. A thick mixture of blood and jelly gush down your hand and Stingtail&apos;s face.*
...Yes, yes, our Shield may have given a lot of itself. I had noticed, you know.
Boots of Discovery
A massive sword with a blade patterned with nicks and scratches. This makes an excellent sidekick for bartering, threatening or general intimidation purposes.
This is going nowhere...
Listen to me: This isn&apos;t good. Whatever&apos;s inside you, it&apos;s smart, and it&apos;s strong. Probably smarter and stronger than you.
My people come for me. My mother. Sarias. The others. They take me away from there... but then the Wolves come. Roost Anlon. He takes me and they cannot stop him.
Ah, well that is the curious thing. They are clearly absent from this world, and yet they are &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;.
Mountain - Misty Tower
Who in their right mind would think of a thing like this?
But I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt;.

Ungh... bolted on there tight, ain&apos;t it.
Justinia returned to her throne. Under her rule, the Dwarven Kingdom fought for the Divine - and her loyalty was unquestionable. Many fine and courageous dwarves did their people great honour, in battle and in death.
Something tells me that he&apos;ll only bring us woe... but I can&apos;t judge him. Yet.
They have attacked? Hell&apos;s teeth, we can&apos;t sit here and do nothing! Our brothers can handle one Seeker without us.
Yes. She&apos;s the very life of my soul.
*Express your sympathies.*
*Say that you want to try and help this girl.*
*Ask the Sister if she can get you an audience with Lord Arhu.*
Oh no! Not at all, I&apos;m incredibly grateful.
A precious person, yes...
On Humans&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Cranley Huwbert’s book on humans makes for interesting reading. While acknowledging humans’ obvious physical limitations, he considers that race to be the most intelligent, intellectual, ingenious, versatile, resourceful, audacious, and adventurous of all the peoples. While many of his claims may be deemed correct, it must be noted that Huwbert himself is human. The trait ‘over-confident’ should perhaps be added to the list.*
It&apos;s all here, I&apos;m afraid. On my person. You&apos;ve found your thief, but I am anything but one of those snivelling addicts you&apos;ll find creeping around the kitchen.
Adventurer&apos;s Treasure
*Your God leaps forward, knocking the frail old man sideways. Rhalic gets to his feet, grabbing a shield emblazoned with a burning sun, and backs away defensively.*
Hail. What a pretty young thing you are. Call me Dorotya.
The encrusted blood still sticking to this dagger reminds you of something Mama always told you. Those who deny their appetites make up for them in other ways. One way or another, the blood will flow.
