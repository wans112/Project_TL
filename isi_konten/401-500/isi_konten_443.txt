In the toymaker&apos;s shop on Arx, we had a vision of ash and fire. The fragment of memory there was overjoyed to be surrounded by trinkets of such esteemed craftsmanship.
Ain&apos;t you somethin&apos; to look at. I&apos;d stick you in a hot pot any day.
*Relent and tell him to explain what he&apos;s doing here.*
What about my second opinion?
The book contains the location of an altar where Death Heralds would summon a creature called ‘Duna’s Undertaker’. Its feathers are used to make armour.
Yeah, but Master Arhu went away with the smelly man. And then he came back!
Transform into the form of an Elf, switching racial talents, skills and tags.
Despite all he has endured, Fane seems in good spirits. Perhaps he&apos;s starting to enjoy this world. Long may that continue...
*His eyes meet yours for a moment once more. Behind them he hides his pain. Then he turns away.*
Verily I say, lizards speak as I do, and my great house - the House of Trade - rules still.
What cause did this knight serve, I wonder?
Whaddya need?
You&apos;re gonna need to blow this pop-weed stand if ya want t&apos;stop her, but maybe this&apos;ll help.
*As your eyes adjust, you realise you&apos;re still aboard the Lady Vengeance. A gust of fresh sea air caresses you, and warm sunshine prickles your skin.*
The Godwoken ritual took us to the Hall of Echoes. Our god told us that to rise to Divinity, we must learn to master our Source powers.
*The rat scurries nearer to the corpses and bares its fangs at you with a protective &lt;i&gt;hiss.*&lt;/i&gt;
*You did not feel the sword blade enter your back.*
I don&apos;t fall for that cock-and-bull story. You pay for that!
Have you never heard of them? From the tales they tell of Braccus Rex?
And one should heed that twicefold for information like this. There is power in names - power far, far beyond the limits of your skull. I&apos;ll not deliver that power unto him. *Spits.*
Tyrants will dredge up any reason to silence the people. Sure, Source isn&apos;t all good - but that don&apos;t mean you can change the world order to control it, either.
Butcher
When the war with the demons began, Marcus took the fight out on the open sea.
*The chest sits there, refusing to open.*
Welcome to the global chat
The day isn&apos;t getting any longer, lass. You ready to help, or not?
We discovered that part of the Source puppet bore an inscription of sorts - &apos;P.O.W.E.R&apos;. Perhaps it has something to do with the place it came from...
But the boss&apos;s found a buyer for this lot. It&apos;s to be shipped off to Arx in the next wagon, if you&apos;d believe it.
We learned that Gratiana was the lover and partner of Braccus Rex. She encouraged him to use the ancient Purging Wands so that he could grow in strength. However the Sourcerer King grew mad with power, and began to purge friend and foe alike.
*Smile. That&apos;s right!*
Isbeil, the dwarven queen&apos;s most trusted advisor, is a servant of the God King. The plot to ship the Deathfog to Arx is hers.
Don&apos;t look so pleased with yourself. You&apos;re too quick to act, too green still. Your bond with the Source may be strengthened, but you are hardly prepared for Divinity.
Soul Key Skull
I hope Wainslow&apos;s alright... he&apos;s one of the good ones.
*Promise Lohar you will go to Arx and deal with this bomb.*
*Whispers* Get out, before he knows you&apos;re here.
Food prices these days. Tut, tut, tut.
When facing peril, your survival matters above all else. Even if it comes at your crew&apos;s expense. Should you die, the kingdom dies with you.
I&apos;m Han. So, uh, Beast. You helped me out just there, so let me return the favour. You want to get out of here?
*Apologise, and tell him you&apos;ve seen no other Magisters.*
Low
I could drop a stone into the well of your heart and it would take the span of a sun&apos;s life for the little traveller to hit bottom: such is the depth of your devotion.
Silence! You will bow before us and explain this intrusion, or by the Seven I will cut you down where you stand!
*Ask her how she got aboard the ship.*
[HERO] *Flex your biceps. You are ready to spread truth in this land of lies!*
Elf Pillar
We know why the King forbade your research.
...and I learned that a heart is a glorious thing.
*She walks away quite casually. And that was the last time you saw Sebille.*
Mine
*Eye him warily, but nod. Tell him you believe in a balanced pantheon. This may work out for the best.*
Vegan Stew
A boat! I&apos;d thank the Divine, but... well...
We refused Lucian. Dallis and Braccus joined him in battle.
Wait.
Slane is in fact an ancient Dragon Knight. We cured him, and he promised to help us... when the time comes.
*Growls...* &lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;
Sweet Amadia, I pray, please let your Sourcerers return with the Soul Jars.
*Place your palm against the elaborate mosaic at its base.*
And if you&apos;re loyal to the Order, you know I&apos;m right, scaley!
[1] improves your casting ability of air-based spells.
*Insist that you&apos;re innocent. You&apos;ve been on the lookout for the vandal, too!*
*The cat purrs, an eerie &lt;i&gt;clicking&lt;/i&gt; sound.*
All In
You&apos;re right to assume that I&apos;m no genie from the ancient sagas. Yet I can still expose the needs that remain hidden - even to you. All you must do is look into my ring and tell me what you see there.
He watched eagerly as those shambling husks descended. It seemed like a game to him. Like theater.
*The dwarf nods grimly. After a long moment he swallows and starts to speak.*
But you can come along for the ride.
*Say no. Tell him you&apos;d rather just kill him.*
*Turn and walk away.*
You... You dare insult a Magister? Scum! I&apos;d have ya shackled, but what&apos;s the point? Soon enough you&apos;ll get that evil sucked right outta ya, and we&apos;ll all be the better for it.
*Begin.*
*Tell him you are more concerned about him. Is he doing alright?*
*The spirit gapes in horror as his hand is consumed - quickly followed by the rest of him.*
Sebille.
Sorry, chief. This is... who I am. What I am. That&apos;s all.
*Tell it that before you answer you&apos;ll need it to give you the password.*
A strange woman. Demon. I never knew what to make of her, but I appreciate what she&apos;s done.
Controls
Must be a celestial party game. Or maybe he wanted to teach me a lesson.
Contrived from the scum of Rivellon&apos;s vilest troll&apos;s feet, witch&apos;s gums, and demon dung, this poison could take down a large-sized wollock.
Well let&apos;s open the discussion by talkin&apos; about your betrayal. I shouldn&apos;t be surprised, and yet...
&lt;i&gt;BRIDGE?!&lt;/i&gt; Look at this wreck! It&apos;s not even a bridge! It&apos;s just some VOID-DAMNED TREES that fell across the river!
*Browse his supplies.*
Blood Cloud
*SQUEAL!*
Mari survived the Voidwoken attack.
Oh, for the love of Lucian, Baladir! You&apos;re acting like a madman!
*The dwarf&apos;s face becomes calm, serene even. He looks into your eyes, tranquil as a baby lamb.*
Lohar the Dwarf became mayor.
*Suddenly, she stops. Her throat ripples as she swallows the last mouthful of corpse flesh. She drops the hand. Her eyes lose focus.*
*Look at him in shock. What ingratitude!*
Master Of Sparks
Improvised Staff
Black Ring Encampment
*Note that you could use the help of a close combat specialist.*
*Say you can&apos;t tell if there&apos;s been growth in your party.*
Necromancer
*Note he has an unusual way of speaking.*
Scaled git.
*The young man fidgets with his armour and half-sword excitedly. He sees you approach.*
I oughtn&apos;t trust you... it&apos;s a foolish risk... but something tells me you won&apos;t betray me. Don&apos;t prove me wrong though, or you&apos;ll regret it... now go.
Resume
*Say that you were merely admiring it.*
*Tell her you need help.*
*Ask why he alone is able to enter the tomb.*
It... it isn&apos;t... right!
Undeployed Explosive Mine
As I promised: miracles at a modest price.
*Reach out to pet the nearest warg.*
*Gurgle*
It&apos;s a kind of switch; apply the right pressure, and it&apos;ll activate.
I wonder if you honour us once more.
*Tell her the egg looked dusty. You were going to clean it.*
Hey! Shortbread! What ya heard about a crate of stolen supplies? And don&apos;t you lie to me now.
*Tell the child he&apos;s mistaken.*
GameMaster&apos;s Journal
B... b... BACAW!
The Lady Vengeance
The Red Prince will unite with Sadha and engender the race of dragons.
If I were you, I&apos;d stay close to Sir Gareth once the fighting begins - w-whatever path he takes will be the surest way to victory...
*Ask why he doesn&apos;t just get rid of the Black Ring&apos;s leader himself.*
*The Magister looks at you, his eyes wide.*
*Hesitate. This is a mistake. You don&apos;t want her to leave. Say you&apos;re sorry you even mentioned it.*
Seven praise you, stranger - you don&apos;t know what it was like for us here. We all thought we were going to die...
Ask me again once we escape, and I&apos;ll tell you tales that will last us a thousand nights.
*Let go.*
The witch has a potion to transform the cows back into humans.
Cannot use when Movement speed is 0.
Help us... like you promised...
I feel it. It&apos;s the spirit of a woman. Prudence. The innkeeper in Driftwood. She made a deal with him, with Adramahlihk. And now she&apos;ll be trapped here... forever.
Toffee
A warning note from Captain Kalwyn regarding a shipment of barrels.
*You peer into the mirror and you see Sadha; the memory of dreams and desires.*
All the best to you.
A fire arrow that is hot to the touch. You probably want to keep it safely away from oils and suchlike.
You did well, my prince. You killed the Red Princess and destroyed her eggs. I did not think you would have the requisite fortitude. I can be such an old cynic at times, but I&apos;m glad you proved me wrong.
...yet cannot extricate themselves from debt.
Geyser Burst
*He gives you one wild-eyed, grateful nod - and keels over.*
Unhealable
Reaper&apos;s Coast will tremble! I will be unstoppable. My power will be complete!
*The spirit turns her gaze upon you. Her eyes blaze with cool disdain. Alert and focused, this spirit is not lost. Not lost at all.*
Ugh, the burning palm thing. Didn&apos;t see that one coming.
*Your bones ache and your skull pounds - but soon, tendrils of Source snake from you into him, and from him into you.*
How unexpectedly shrewd you are...
You are not of the Black Ring. And yet you are undead. But... I sense good in you.
Thank You
Forgive us, buttercup, but we can&apos;t leave without that Source. But at least we know you make a &lt;i&gt;beautiful &lt;/i&gt;corpse...
Amadia&apos;s blessings on this day! I would pray the goddess keeps you in her grace, but clearly she favours you already. Welcome to her shrine and sanctuary.
I am... &lt;b&gt;Braccus Rex! &lt;/b&gt;I am the &lt;b&gt;Source King &lt;/b&gt;-
I hunger for it!
Bladed Weapons
Oil-Stained Key from the Blackpits
Hm? Ah yes. Welcome back. You need a hand with anything, let me know.
I trusted you, you treacherous salamander!
As we retrieved Lagan&apos;s ring, a Voidwoken attacked.
Just looook at him. He&apos;s got such a quick mind and boooooody. I could just eeeat him uuuuuup!
*Ask the dog his name.*
We could be everything, yet you opt to let us be &lt;i&gt;nothing. &lt;/i&gt;To let every death in Arx mean &lt;i&gt;nothing!&lt;/i&gt;
Muted. Can&apos;t cast.&lt;br&gt;
Damp to the touch, this wand smells faintly of sea currents from far-off lands.
You wouldn&apos;t expect anything less from a Source smuggler...
