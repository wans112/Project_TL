You can&apos;t see her. She&apos;s in the house. And those &lt;i&gt;things &lt;/i&gt;are all around. Void things.
Thank you! BACAW!
*Ask him what now.*
*Her gaze falls on you - a glimmer of awareness... she raises her hand as a greeting...*
You want me to drag a White across the coast in viewing distance of a dozen Magisters, and get a tongue-lashing from Malady as reward? I have not lost &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; sense, I assure you.

Hey! Do you know the magicky stuff everyone&apos;s so scared of? Source?

I appreciate the attention. But your fingers aren&apos;t as talented as you think.
Oh, but you do get around, don&apos;t you?
Dead Black Ring Reaver
*A Black Ring priestess turns to you. Her astonishing beauty takes your breath away. Her gaze drifts past you... and you realise that she&apos;s blind. She breathes in, as if tasting the air - as if tasting &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;

With more undead than ever before, she founded an abbey in the Dragonspine mountains,
Good for you, darling. We could all use a little good news about now, couldn&apos;t we. What comes next will be... well, it&apos;ll be up to &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;how it will be.
Magister Cecil
I thank you for your efforts. Your great efforts. We all do.

Pursued by Magisters, the Sourcerer Hannag fled west to the Cloisterwoods. If we help her, she may mentor us.
