I just cannot bear to leave my poor wife, you understand. There would be some gold in it for you, naturally.
*Wonder what Lucian would do? Surely he&apos;d have the wisdom to show mercy.*
&lt;i&gt;Careful...&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask the rabbit if he&apos;s alright.*
Seen a wound before, have you, merc? That blade was touched with Source - Kilgallion suffered before he died. &apos;tween you and me, he went a little mad. That was no ordinary blade. &lt;i&gt;That &lt;/i&gt;was a Sourcerer&apos;s weapon.
*Realise she just needs to calm down and grab her by the shoulders. Count slowly to ten. One... two... three...*
*Ask why the Lone Wolves took her.*
Mailsplitter
Apocalyptic.
This place is a wreck. You destroy what isn&apos;t yours, I wager.
So yes, thank you.
*Refuse Fane&apos;s pleading look. You&apos;re not giving this nutcase anything!*
*The Magister glances around the cells... before ripping the keys from his belt and casting them aside.*
*Tell her she&apos;ll have to explain to Griff why she interfered with the deal he made with you.*
*Sigh*. I spent my life singing for my slaves to bring me my supper. Finer fare than boiled roots and rotten tubers, too!
You made your choice. Are you ready to die for it?
Comin&apos; right up, darling.
*Reach into your satchel and pull out the will. You&apos;ve done your part.*
Fight Theme 06 Percussion
*Greet him as an equal; Rivellon is godless - you owe him no worship.*
Now that you mention it, there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one other promise I need to keep.
*Demand to know about this &apos;promise&apos;.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the philosophical skeleton behind.
A waste of a blazing spirit.
All were killed. This did, however, put an end to the famine.
*The spirit glares at you in defiance, until she is no more.*
I&apos;ve been sailin&apos; for a long time, but I don&apos;t know I&apos;ve ever seen so much &lt;i&gt;drama, &lt;/i&gt;not in all my years! Hookin&apos; up with your crew&apos;s been nothin&apos; if not eventful.
Being suddenly roused startled me. Swept between sleep and awakening, I could not be certain: is it really him? The very one I&apos;ve been waiting for?
I&apos;ll have you know that threatening one&apos;s Master is punishable by death! Rein in your impertinence will you? I&apos;m a fair man, but I won&apos;t spare the rod!
Abandoned Workshop
*As the power starts to seep into your body, you feel a force pulling away from you - clawing at you, fighting back.*
HA! Voidwoken. Good one. You&apos;re a regular *HIC!* jester...
*Smile. Ask him if he can still play.*
*Tell the creature that you don&apos;t understand what it&apos;s saying.*
*Attack the dog. You&apos;ve had enough of his threats.*
Come - this way! In the back. Follow me.
You... you released me, elf... long have I waited for this moment...
I&apos;ll salvage what I can. It won&apos;t be much.
Magical Dwarven War Axe
Mmmm, who are you, you lovely little halfing?
Yer bloody art yanked our souls out like we were a bad act at a piss-tier inn.
The hatch is blocked. I&apos;ll need to find another way.
*Tell him you can&apos;t deal with a man who doesn&apos;t like dogs. Turn and walk away.*
*The slime beast growls and lurches forward to attack.*
Earth
Back off, man! Can&apos;t you see he&apos;s upset enough about Donna without all this?
*Ask how it ended up with this... problem. Remind it to tell the truth.*
*Tell him to cut the noble pretence. You saw him talking with Ifan already.*
We found a tome that detailed a case of possession. It stated that efforts to save the victim had proved to be futile, and that it was difficult to tell if it was the victim or the demon that spoke at any particular moment.
Thank you very much for your time! I&apos;m certain we&apos;ll meet again soon, and the pleasure will be all mine!
*Tell her she should have known this would happen, if she&apos;s really a seer. She should have stayed away from you.*
*Tell him you want to see his very best supplies. &lt;i&gt;The fate of the dwarves may depend on&apos;t.*&lt;/i&gt;
Captain Ablewether&apos;s Diary
GUR. GUR. WAAAAAAAARRGH!
The Shadow Prince tricked Lucian and the Divine Order into the Deathfog attack that decimated the elves.
There&apos;s a gap between what we want and what we can have, isn&apos;t there. Here more than anywhere else.
I, on the other &apos;and, know full well that it&apos;s the master&apos;s admiration for my gen&apos;ral bearing, demeanour, and intrinsic greatness wot is most indicative of a state of actual love. &apos;e near worships me, &apos;e does!
The machine is manipulating time itself. I&apos;m in a hurry here!
What? You have a duty: gather more Source and complete the ritual!
No... Not the final dark... Not yet...
Jussst you wait!
Kind of looked like they were working together. Like us, but not quite so hideous.
Only five teeth left, and two of them wobbly! I need to find another line of work...
*Tell him you&apos;re no-one&apos;s mouthpiece, and that you seek no quarrel either.*
[MYSTIC] *Say that all come back - through death, and life reborn.*
Firewater is dead. Now he&apos;ll never utter Edie&apos;s name.
Sample one for my next supper at sea, will I.
*Ask if &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;&apos;d be fine, collared like a dog and stuck in a ship&apos;s hold with a corpse and a murderer on the loose.*

Key
The Magisters weren&apos;t to lay a hand on the dwarves. But... why?
I hold my end of the bargain. I show you the way out. But... I have something more to ask of you.
Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m sure life&apos;s no picnic for &lt;i&gt;them &lt;/i&gt;either. But I&apos;ve heard it all before. We&apos;ve got a whole realm to protect. And Sourcerers just can&apos;t be trusted.
*Brush her comments away. This sounds totally overblown.*
The king. The king. We displeased mad Braccus Rex. The truth we spoke. His fortune told. No divinity would he be.
By Lucian&apos;s sword, lizard, we meet again! Would that circumstances were better here than in Fort Joy. But they are not; Voidwoken lie in wait beyond the bridge.
Oh no! Oh no, not my mum! I&apos;ll go find her. Mum, I&apos;m coming!
Leave me. *Cough* Leave!
*Point out that the tinkerer is skilled enough to murder Magisters. Surely he&apos;s skilled enough to sneak out of a decrepit fish factory?*
*Nod your assent.*
I know I can trust you. I know that better than anything else in the world. Truth is, I think you&apos;d make a spectacular Divine. And I know you&apos;ll get this bloody demon out of me as soon as you can.
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? A vagrant creeper?
Salamander Talk
As per our terms, the location...
See - that&apos;s not the way this works, old friend. And if I must take your life t&apos;see my people thrive, then so be it.
I do not fall for silly tricks. You earned yourself a ticket back to your prison cell.
*He winces and moans; tears stream down his shivering face, but he doesn&apos;t speak a word.*
*Lean in and whisper that the Magister belowdecks suffered a fatal encounter.*
Let &apos;er rot there. Newbies oughta know what happens to an elf who steps outta line.
*Nod. You are.*
Oh good - you&apos;re awake.
Don&apos;t worry, kids, I&apos;m sure your buddy Joe is just fine, hanging out with his mother in Fort Joy.
*Point to the jailed undead. What is her crime?*
Spirit of a Possessed Elementalist
If you ever wish to leave - if the Seekers are to survive - you must use the purging wand to destroy the Shriekers. Go, before it is too late.
Amadia is merciful in her love.
That is to say: a very honest god.
Look around you - this place is a mausoleum. My father came here, before he died. He killed the Godwoken. He killed the masters who taught them. He killed &lt;i&gt;anyone &lt;/i&gt;who could deny me the right to succeed him.
*Laugh and say you&apos;ll be keeping the contract... you intend to cash it in yourself.*
*She bows her head, ready to depart...*
Not ssssso fassssssst...
I teach you to mess with other people&apos;s stuff!
Wait - you&apos;re no Magister. You&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/i&gt;. What are you doing here, filthy scrounger? Choose your words carefully; my fists ache to meet a new face.
Oh, goodness. You must be disappointed. I&apos;m only guessing, mind you. Hard to read your face when it&apos;s so... bony and all.
The Magister Crusade
...was it you who found him?
That&apos;s it! I call Court. Pay up!
If I was a cowardly, murderous dog, where would I hide?
A little receptacle for tinctures and ointments of all kinds. The scent of drudanae lingering within this one suggests it was used recently for none too savoury a purpose.
Enable Trading
Easy, bonebag, or I&apos;ll root you to the ground and call a Voidwoken to show you the true meaning of terror. Muah-hah!
It was Lord Arhu&apos;s creation. He is the crypt&apos;s keeper, of course, and oversaw the construction himself. He couldn&apos;t have done it without the help of Sanders, though. Quite a talent for engineering, that one.
It&apos;s the silver shaft that&apos;s missing. There&apos;s an anvil where silver can be properly melded... that ought to do it.
Redirect the Deathfog. Better to poison the fishes than to poison the people.
*The squirrel sits quietly for a moment, running his hand down the cat&apos;s spine. Quercus arches his back and flexes his claws.*

I&apos;d rather spend an eternity floating in Void to one spent in bondage. &lt;i&gt;Send me to the King.&lt;/i&gt;
Och! The Beast himself infests this rotting town, does he? Oh, the poems I&apos;ve heard chanted of your deeds and misdeeds...
Nonsense. I could sense your guilt from a mile away.
...but the Blanchard boy was lame and had no use of his left foot anyway. And I gave him plenty of amber ale to numb the pain, as well. Quite kind of me, all things considered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mother&apos;s punishments were... formidable. Next time, I&apos;ll do what must needs be done so that she&apos;ll never find out. I can only blame myself for leaving the Blanchard boy alive.
We opened the door to the second room.

*The desk is locked tight. Instead of a keyhole, there&apos;s a gilded inlay that bears an engraving - &apos;It was all for you&apos;. Beneath this sits a framed square of blank parchment.*

Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 19: Ranging
The voice that rings inside me now is darker than any that came before.
*The dwarf stands impassively, black eyes staring at you. A bruise is slowly spreading where you struck her.*
I thought the new Divine would have more pressing matters to attend to than to keep talking to me... evidently not.
*Nod at the efficiency of their judiciary.  Perhaps you have misjudged humans.*
*Tell him to back the hells off.*
I meant nothing personal, of course.
*The spirit of a rather old man dodders around, seemingly oblivious to the condition of the room. He turns and offers you a genial smile.*
You watch yourself - there&apos;s a voice whispering promises to the dead around here.
You have a daunting task ahead of you. But I might be able to help stoke your embers.
Enough. I have your head for that!
*You re-examine the skeleton.*
What?! Quickly, you must inform Magister Carver at the barracks at once!
