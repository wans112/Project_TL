*Brush her off. She doesn&apos;t know a thing about it.*
I&apos;m a demon, not a poodle.
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry to have disturbed her. You have no doubt it&apos;s been a difficult day.*
The predator. Tsss, tsss. Shouldn&apos;t have come here little hunter.
Branded with the insignia of Lucian&apos;s Divine Order, this shield has borne the brunt of many a Black Ring fighter&apos;s fury.
Decomposed
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;COAL FANG&lt;/b&gt;.*
Twice today I&apos;ve heard those words. Their leader, Gareth, insisted that he could lead them out of this place.
Squire
Tattered and stained, this piece of paper smells strongly of pumpkins.
[BEAST] *Say that instead of complaining he should give them a good thrashing then.*
*The hurt dismay in his eyes only strengthens as you sap the living energy from his helpless soul. You have a feeling you won&apos;t forget that look for a long, long time.*
*Ask about her rat love. What makes him so attractive?*
Wait... what&apos;s this? There&apos;s a note in here.
A woman from Driftwood with nary a care&lt;br&gt;Offered me kisses that answered my prayer.&lt;br&gt;I accepted her gift, and then to my dismay,&lt;br&gt;A spider she was, and I her buffet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once feasting was over, she licked her red lips.&lt;br&gt;I rose from the floor, still coming to grips.&lt;br&gt;She thanked me for coming and bade her farewell,&lt;br&gt;My prayer indeed answered, though still I did... swell.

A glistening Source Orb. Consuming this will bestow a Source Point upon you.
A messenger from Rhalic! You come! You come in my dotage to bring me to his feasting halls!
Lone Adventurer
No. They are something else entirely.
But I... I made a mistake. A man called Kemm came to me. He commissioned an ode to a lord known as the God King. It delighted all those that heard it, minus one: the Doctor himself.
&apos;...Hereby layeth &lt;i&gt;Bounty&lt;/i&gt; upon the Fell Sourcerer Murderers of &lt;i&gt;Alexandar,&lt;/i&gt; Bishop Divine. She or He or It who slayeth said Sourcerers, or other Sourcerers, with Malice or without...&apos;
Speak with Gwydian Rince.
I would&apos;ve preferred not to know. How dark the night can get. How close you can stand at the edge of oblivion and feel... nothing.
Assault Gloves
Well, that was efficient!
you must walk a dark path.
Special prices for you, my friend. Gotta stick with your own in times of trouble, right?

The Mother is in danger. A shadow hunts her. You must rid us of the shadow.
Treated me like a slave.
*Ask how he and his nurses survived the Deathfog. It&apos;s suspicious.*
My word, the futility...
*Tell him to forget it.*
*Through the stench of the sewers the face of a giant spider looms. It opens its jaws... and lunges at your face.*
[VILLAIN] *Scrape your finger across your neck and wink. Tell him to compose a poem for you. At no cost to yourself, of course.*
*Ask if he&apos;s ever heard of the Aeteran.*
Mordus! N-no! &lt;i&gt;Not Mordus!&lt;/i&gt;
Rise of the Empress: An Annotated History of Civil War
I&apos;m... I was fixin- &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to fix up this delivery device.
The Godwoken&apos;s sacrifice severed the link that bound the Sworn to the God King,
You have my thanks, sister.
That&apos;s the spirit!
*You hear a grunt of surprise as your lips press into his, before his arms move behind the small of your back and pull you close.*
The one who set me free... I owe them eferythink. &lt;i&gt;Eferythink&lt;/i&gt;.
I owe you a debt, but I already know what you desire... and I intend to pay in full, right now. Tell me, do you know exactly &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;I am?
A new journey awaits. Pray to me, and I will guide you.

*Her lips pout, but otherwise, her face is steel.*
Maybe... Maybe. I just... you know. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt;.
Thassa spirit. How about just one more? Penny for a dead dog? In memoriam, as &apos;twere?
What could possibly be more wholesome?
*He hands you a wooden box, its surface dull to the touch. A vague sickness overwhelms you. There&apos;s Deathfog inside...*
I understand your skepticism. Trust is hard to come by in the Hollow Marshes. But to know my name is to trust in me, just as it was with the late Divine.
You might not bow to me in this life, but maybe you&apos;ll bow to him in the next.
It&apos;s a pity that my experiments have concluded for now - I&apos;m sure you would have made an excellent test subject, stranger.
Find Hannag in Paradise Downs.
The one who brought us here... the &lt;i&gt;demon &lt;/i&gt;that wears the face of my kin. Only she can set the course back to the land of the living. She is here still; I can &lt;i&gt;feel her&lt;/i&gt;...
All I want in return for this information is a trio of curios that is said to be kept inside: The Portrait of the Divine, the Cup of Kings and the Scroll of Eternity. Everything else is yours.

*Tell him you can&apos;t help but notice that he too is... undead.*
Hear ye, hear ye! Divine Order to march against the Ancient Empire!
Keep your nose down, newbie.

The Lady Vengeance
*Draw your weapon. You&apos;ve been aching for a good fight...*
Stop right there! Some thief takes off with my things. I need to search your belongings.
*The vines have split the corpse&apos;s chest with incredible force. Thin roots wriggle from limbs and nail-beds, anchoring it to the ground.*
What in the hells are those things?!

Pillar of Duna
When we first met, I thought there might&apos;ve been potential there, honestly. But... we&apos;re just too different.
Indeed - just as sensible as getting off a sinking ship and leaving a fellow to his business.
There. Its power is yours again. Use it well.
You all right, stranger?
It appears Wyvlia, the Black Bull&apos;s cook, is behind the Magister disappearances.

Darling, you&apos;re here!
Fashionable Boots
*Her eyes &lt;i&gt;clear &lt;/i&gt;for just a moment, showing a brief glimpse of the child within... then the blackness fills them once again, and the demon hisses at you.*
Permit me to mark it on your map. Do not tarry, he urgently desires to speak with the magnificence that is you, &lt;i&gt;Lohse.&lt;/i&gt;
Not to mention his son Alexandar - who the world&apos;s better off without, even if &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; thought him worth sparing. Driven by fear, he took his father&apos;s power and used it to turn innocent Sourcerers to Silent Monks in Fort Joy.
*Wonder what he&apos;ll get up to next.*
I&apos;ve got no use for empty platitudes - not from some snobbish lobster chosen as the Seven&apos;s special pet.

*He reaches out and examines your bandages, rubbing them between his fingers.*
Far too late.
Blue Opal Necklace
They ran away. They ran to the north. The witch and the traitor!
*You stand on your toes and look into the window. Golly! Interesting to see the beast with two backs and two tails from a rather different vantage point.*
There is much weakness in revelation. What upper hand you had, you&apos;ve lost.
We can find Han and his friends somewhere deep in the marshes.
City Guard Priest
I did not ascend, but supported my companion&apos;s claim on Divinity. May they be better than the last Divine. They could hardly be worse.
Spider monkey? You mean DRAGON!
You didn&apos;t have enough Source, did you? You had all the materials, but not the Source.
[HUMAN] *Smile and tell the elf there&apos;s no need to be so defensive - you mean no harm.*
Truly we are blessed to know you. If Amadia favours you, that is all I need to know. Go in peace, brother.

She’ll sic her rats and call her cats,&lt;br&gt;She’ll feed you to a camp of bats,&lt;br&gt;Don’t say hi to Malice Alice, or you’ll fly off as a crow.
This thing belongs in a museum.
*Tell him that Arx is now a ruin, shrouded in Deathfog.*
One last query. Is there a difference between right and wrong? The truth is that there is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; - only action and consequence. Oh &lt;i&gt;ho! &lt;/i&gt;I got you there!
[1] gives you a [2]% bonus against being Frozen, Stunned, Petrified and Knocked Down.
So you keep saying. And yet, here I -
