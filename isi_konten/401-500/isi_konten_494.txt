There is naught to discuss.
I read through some tomes I saw that cranky old lizard carrying. Some fascinating leads, but nothing like the power we need to stop the Knights of Drey and their wicked plot.
*Softly tell her that everything&apos;s alright... there&apos;s nothing to be afraid of.*

Darling! It&apos;s so good to see you - and in fleshly form, no less. I admit I wish we could share more... carnal pleasures. Yet I think a kiss is the height of intimacy. Now come closer, and receive your soul&apos;s desire.
*Insist he won&apos;t. He&apos;s dead.*
As rain!
May you and Sadha forever be united!

Incomplete - but enough. We are whole. And soon we are many.

*Tell him you&apos;re a dwarf of the world, always looking to explore the many hidden delights of this existence.*
*She searches the darkness cloaking your face, looking for the truth, or for perfidy. Finds neither.*
Dwarves became the most advanced of the races.

Letter from Magister Loke&apos;s Mother
*Beast looks unsure once again, his innate confidence melting as he takes in the sight of you.*
B-b-bad bird! Hanging from a branch, with its wings spread wide and a terrible squawk. Don&apos;t -  bo-gawk - don&apos;t go!
Belonged to a family buried near here - the Surreys. I&apos;ve been reading up on them. An ancient clan of eccentrics and oddballs. Fascinating people, truly.
&apos;Here lies Withermoore the Noxious&apos;
We convinced him to leave his house - but he refused to go unarmed.
...for now. THE HUNT CONTINUES! Empyreo, away!
*Look at her incredulously. One of the most powerful Sourcerers in the land can&apos;t train you? Why not?*
Escapist
Skulk
I must find powerful Sourcerers who can help me master my underdeveloped Source powers; then I can claim Divinity at the Well of Ascension.
This is an even better occasion.
*Hang your head. Beast made his choices - and death was the consequence.*
Feather
Is that so? Well looks like the crowd&apos;ll get its money&apos;s worth, fer sure. You accept her challenge, do ya?
I take it you&apos;ve no objections to the imminent death of my mark?
The delicate scent of this rose&apos;s velvety petals is the perfect tonic for a road-weary adventurer&apos;s senses.
High Quality Life Essence
Like recognises like. The Black Ring had great uses for my powers, but those powers aren&apos;t enough to help us escape this place...
Best keep this for when I truly need it.
*Smile. A good fight is just what you need to make yourself at home.*
*She absentmindedly fingers her needle; hesitates.*
How curious. The Godwoken would defend his oppressor in the face of his &lt;i&gt;liberator?&lt;/i&gt;
Uh...
To tell you the truth, I&apos;ve no idea why I&apos;m red, but I do fancy I was rather lucky to be born a prince. My heritage made people &lt;i&gt;celebrate&lt;/i&gt; my... uniqueness. Had I been common-born they might have just drowned me in a well.
*Fill yourself with the spirit&apos;s Source.*
At least I can still access all of my tools in the Hall of Echoes... I wouldn&apos;t relish to prospect of scouring through all this wreckage to find what I need...
[VILLAIN] *Tell her you prefer to keep breathing. Stopping other people&apos;s breath, on the other hand...*
*One of her eyebrows arcs, like a cat arching its back, ready to scratch.*
Why, look at that! Just what I ordered. Ain&apos;t you a peach, love. And ol&apos; Dain here&apos;d thank you too, if he could.
Tarquin died before we could confront him for resurrecting Braccus Rex.
*Ask how many dead.*
*The spirit&apos;s expression doesn&apos;t change.*
*Don&apos;t give him the ring. Chuckle and walk away, jangling the gold in the pocket.*
This place is dangerous, Master. I can feel the ground quake and the seas boil. But I am here to serve, as you wish.

First, you&apos;ve got to get off this island - at any cost. Do you understand? I didn&apos;t save you from that ship wreck just to see you drown in a puddle on this blasted island.
&apos;Hand in hand&apos;. Hah. As if I don&apos;t know you better than that by now. There&apos;s no &apos;we&apos; in this scenario. You want my body for  yourself.
Sebille&apos;s old master may be here on the Nameless Isle. We should tread carefully.
*Lean back and prod the lamp with your boot.*
*Shake your head. He needn&apos;t know.*
Male Dwarf Skeleton
*Interesting. Wonder if she knows where any of these vaults are?*
We count a victory today, and we count a friend in you. Saheila is with us. *Bows.* I see the good in you, I see the bad in you, I see the all of you.
*Ask him what he has in mind.*
The point is that, unlike your attention span, I did not give up until I found what I was looking for.
I can&apos;t express enough thanks. Maybe... maybe our sacrifices aren&apos;t always for naught.
*He laughs - three measured chuckles, each a little more disturbing than the last.*
&lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt; Please just &lt;i&gt;help &lt;/i&gt;me!
*The woman raises her head as you approach. Tears run down her ruddy face, but she manages a weak smile.*
Tutorials
Your kind&apos;re getting too big for your boots, you know. Bloody cavies. Ought&apos;a keep outta our hair if you don&apos;t want to pay for the pleasure.
To your empire. To your beloved Sadha.
*Ifan bites his lip, hard enough to draw blood.*
[RED PRINCE] *Remark that suddenly you feel compelled to leave the chest alone.*
Hardly. I cry for peace; they yearn for war. They stray from civilised thought, ignore the lessons and memories of the fallen.
Truly...? Then perhaps the tyrant has fallen, and my princess might be free! Be sure to tell her - it&apos;ll raise her spirits to no end!
Magister Carver needs help with his investigation. He may offer a reward.
Indeed it would...
A pocket spatial vortex that teleports its hapless victim to a random location.
*She places the tip of a long-bladed spear on poor dead Sarias&apos;s chest-bone.*
&lt;i&gt;Ha&lt;/i&gt;.
Now get out before I see you buried in the garden with the other trash!
Rush forward in a straight line, to a designated point, hitting all enemies in your path with [1] and setting Knockdown.
*You reach out to vampirise her essence, but Windego&apos;s spirit remains whole. The more effort you expend, the stronger the resistance.*
*Lie. Tell her you&apos;re a member of the groom&apos;s party.*
To end it all, one way or another.
*Prudence&apos;s terror does not abate, joined now as it is with confusion.*
Then I need but to be myself.
*Mention his spat with Malady.*
Lock Level
*You&apos;re not interested in him romantically. Tell him so.*
I like a lover who likes the arts. Here we go. *ahem*... A princess was once locked indoors.
*Wonder why he&apos;s looking for this person.*
Mrmeowr...
*Squeak! Squeak!*
Return to the Seekers at Amadia&apos;s sanctuary.
Stand down, Magister Roe. This one is... &lt;i&gt;an old acquaintance&lt;/i&gt;, and escorted one of our own to safety, I hear. Let him approach.
Oh my darling. My sweet, sweet darling...
Marked Barrel
Your kind. And the dwarves and elves besides. Those of you that&apos;d see the whole realm eaten up by the Voidwoken &apos;fore you&apos;d change your ways.
Dwarf business. Might be of interest to Beast.
Loading [1] ([2]%)
Myrella&apos;s the finest cleric I&apos;ve got - you could be damn near split in two by a sword, and she&apos;d &lt;i&gt;still &lt;/i&gt;get you back on your feet.
*Take pity on her. She has expressed her sorrow; she may pass to the Hall of Echoes.*
*The spore in your bag bursts, spewing fumes. The Scion whirls on you.*
Big Mallet
* Take your leave. *
No. Please.
Ain&apos; t a thing skewed about it! Bloody lizards &apos; n&apos;  the rest of &apos; em are runnin&apos;  amok around the realm, callin&apos;  Void beasts as they please. Someone&apos; s gotta stand up to &apos; em when they act up!
Use this mystical frame with a rune to imbue the rune with extra properties.
*Tell him the Doctor has perished. He can speak freely.*
*Miniature crossed weapons wrought from metal signify that this is... or was... an armoury.*
Indeed it should. The battles ahead shall not be easily won - but at least now they &lt;i&gt;can &lt;/i&gt;be won.
Truth be told it feels... lighter. An&apos; if you think that makes me a better person - you&apos;re wrong. So get lost, I&apos;m on watch here.

When we left Reaper&apos;s Coast, none of us were champions of the arena in Driftwood.
*The Magister rests his hand lightly on his weapon.*
*Then suddenly in the distance: a streak of red; as if a gargantuan dragon opens a solitary eye. That is where you are headed.*

[DWARF] *Say you never imagined yourself in a Divine Order prison. Not by a longshot.*
*Smile. You know your kind are considered cannibals, but you didn&apos;t know &apos;illiterate&apos; had joined the list.*
You... leave me be. Just... *cough* leave!
May he return indeed. Maybe then we can stop praying and get back to our lives.
*Hilga jabbers excitedly with Brax, but the two go quiet as you approach.*
*He looks up at the vast, empty sky and smiles.*

*Say you found that old crate, but it was empty as all get-out.*
*The translucent blade glows as if lit from within, though you can discern no definite light source.*
*He pauses expectantly, then frowns.*
*Pull back and stride away; you prefer to choose the fights you get in yourself.*
*The young girl lies silently on the floor, eyes open and staring. Her only movement is the tiniest rise and fall of her chest.*
[SCHOLAR] *Say that even the most cursory study of history shows all things move in cycles: from good to bad, from bad to worse... surely something good is just around the corner.*

Then you&apos;re not listenin&apos; hard enough, mate. Go on.

*The spirit watches in fascination as he passes one spectral hand right through the other.*
This grisly device is used for removing intact faces from suitable corpses. For what, you may well ask? Those who practice such arcane arts use them for crafting shapeshifting masks.

Fine. I won&apos;t shun new allies - not after the amount of casualties we&apos;ve taken. Here, let me give you some advice - it might save your life like you saved mine...
That only worrrks with alligatorrrs. Now leave me alone...
There you are! I hear Malady wants to continue the journey. We&apos;ve but to talk to the Lady Vengeance and off we pop.
I love you.
She was looking for something... something valuable. But what?
