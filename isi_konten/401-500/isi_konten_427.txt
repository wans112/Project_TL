*Humour the rat, and ask if she is guarding this place.*
I&apos;m... not even gonna ask.
It&apos;s a very lonely thing indeed to be the object of a people&apos;s worship. What is revered is feared at the same time.
Press
But I lied, Mama, I lied! &lt;i&gt;There&apos;s plenty of power down there.&lt;/i&gt;
Warron
*Gareth is still. For a moment, his mind wanders to memories of friends and enemies, of Malady and Magisters, of demons and Divinity. He is then present once more, though hardly animated.*
A demonologist might be able to help Lohse. There may be one on the mainland.
These rhymes in this book are mostly rubbish, apart from these 3 lines that you add to your recipe book:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a dagger razor sharp&lt;br&gt;From a long branch she did craft&lt;br&gt;A straight and narrow arrow shaft
You utter fool. Very well, if you want to share his cause, then you&apos;ll share his fate!
Requisition - Sourcerer Hold&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pumpkinseed flour: 1 crate&lt;br&gt;Sunflower flour: 1 crate&lt;br&gt;Turnips: 3 crates&lt;br&gt;Cabbages: 1 crate&lt;br&gt;Human ale: 1/2 crate
Conjure a cloud of thick blessed smoke that makes characters Invisible.
*Ifan draws his weapon, wordless. His eyes are hard, and his mouth is set in a thin line.*
&lt;b&gt;BACK! Back or we will kill the girl. You will have no prize!&lt;/b&gt;
*The spirit of a Magister stands forlornly before you.*
Find Ablewether&apos;s wrecked ship.
You just made the wrong move.
Some Magisters are helping Sourcerers escape. Who are these dissidents?
Hmm - I figured we&apos;d be Silent Monks by now. Not that I&apos;m complaining.
[NOBLE] *Back away from this filthy madman.*
*Draw your weapon and step between the Magister and the tinkerer. You&apos;ve been aching to thrash a Magister all day...*
Observations on the Universal Veil
*The child cringes at the idea, but his apparent unease passes quickly. He squeezes a few tears out. They drip down his face in big, shimmering droplets.*
*The prisoner&apos;s buoyant voice darkens as his gaze finds the sunken hollows that once held your eyes.*
*Tell him it&apos;s simple - you have the ring, he wants the ring, he pays you for the ring.*
Under the Tavern
*Bless him. This is not the time to release your rancour.*
*She kisses her forefinger, then presses it against your forehead.*
We count a victory today. Saheila is with us. I see the good in you...
*Tip him a wink and walk away.*
Precious Necklace
Undead Black Ring Flameweaver
Spirit of Audrey
*The couple notice you approach. The man offers a cheery smile. The woman watches you a little more warily, her arms crossed in front of her.*
*Ask how he got captured by the Magisters.*
*Something shifts beneath her robes - the outline of a &lt;i&gt;diminuitive third arm&lt;/i&gt;. A mewling cry can be heard from her abdomen. She places a hand over it and winks.*
Keep strong. Lucian will preserve you.
Dubious Flyer
*...or as a warning.*
But what you ask was expressly forbidden by the Divine. Lucian was so intent his tomb remain sacred that he enacted the Sourcerer pogrom. Better to silence all Sourcerers than to chance a Godwoken arising... and entering.
*Ask where exactly she thinks the Meistr is.*
It&apos;s dead - good riddance to the vile beast.
[UNDEAD] *Say you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;, but that your sense of taste isn&apos;t what it used to be.*
*Bitter. It&apos;s the only word that comes to mind when you try to interpret Jonathan&apos;s expression. The ruin encircling him is mirrored by his enraged face.*
Perhaps we can have something done about these collars while we&apos;re at it.
*He looks at you sternly, for all the world like a schoolmaster lecturing an errant brat.*
&apos;Callum Anchoret Lies Here.&lt;br&gt;Fell in the Great War. Aged 14.&apos;
*Boast that you not only found the tinkerer, but you killed him too.*
Dwarven wedding interrupted by Voidwoken! Brave dwarves party on!
*A whisper and a moan.*
Spirit of Lohar
*The woman sits, staring at nothing, her face a twisted mask of grief and horror. Nothing you do seems to get a reaction from her.*
*Tell her the truth. You met Rhalic, and he told you that she, Lohse, was a liability.*
King&apos;s Heart
Keep what I told you to yourself, y&apos;hear? We can&apos;t stop the riff-raff going in there, but there&apos;s no need to lay out the red carpet for &apos;em either...
Yes, do please excuse me for I&apos;ve a party of dignitaries to attend to. They&apos;ve an appetite for an aperitif, and the port - needless to say - does not pour itself.
We have left Reaper&apos;s Coast without encountering Ryker.
You are not your own. You are a dwarf, and our people teeter at the very brink of... of &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. You would abandon them?
Tarquin
But you&apos;re far too smart for any such shenanigans, aren&apos;t you? Of course you are.
Lash out at your opponent, dealing [1] and setting Atrophy on them.
*Tell her you have no special feeling about her one way or another.*
[1] gives all magical skills a critical chance equal to [2]% of your critical chance score.
Yonder portal will take you back to Rivellon, where the God King awaits. Good luck, my prince. I love you.
The Inquisitor strolled through the townâ€™s silent streets. &apos;One among you is a practitioner of dark magic. Show yourself.&apos; As the words faded, a shadow emerged from the far end of the square. &apos;Another foolish Source Hunter?&apos; it called. &apos;Run off while you can. This town is mine.&apos; The Inquisitor stood firm. &apos;No longer.&apos; In the distance, the dark mage&apos;s fingertips glowed sickly green. &apos;Then die.&apos; Green sparks traced spiralling arcs towards the Inquisitor, though none hit their mark as it darted forward. One fist sent the Sourcerer sprawling. &apos;Nicely done,&apos; the figure croaked, &apos;but at this range I won&apos;t miss!&apos; His hand had only begun to blaze green once more as the Inquisitor sent an arc of electricity into the dark mage&apos;s chest. &apos;Neither will I&apos;.
*Your sudden blow catches the Red Prince off guard. Blood flows copiously from his nose.*
&apos;The Mesmeric Tome of Ladie Pautieni.&apos;
*Your blow lands a little harder than intended, and Herman&apos;s chest gouts blood as the armour compresses with a wet crunch. He sways.*
My journey continues. This chapter ends. I leave.
Do you hear that? I think there&apos;s somebody &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; there.
Got wind of a vandal on the prowl. Confess, criminal!
Q
&lt;i&gt;Or are you ashamed of your sins?&lt;/i&gt;
Can we go in now? I want to see the paintings.
A mysterious cellar underneath a creepy mansion? That seems about right.
That is what we like to believe isn&apos;t it? The irony is that we very much used to be, when we were something... different.
Spirit of Toymaster Sanders
This is where the Outlaw Empress found her, promising she would create dragonbone armour without parallel.
*Nod. You&apos;ll be happy to return home when all this is over.*
See! Zapor&apos;s sea dogs never die!
Controller Layout
Heart of the Mother Tree
*She flashes her ring at you, and you stare at the luminescent stone at its centre. You are floating on a current of pure Source, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colours and fuzzy images.*
There&apos;s more than water down here. I wonder where it leads.
*&apos;Why the long faces?!&apos;*
Don&apos;t tell me you &lt;i&gt;care,&lt;/i&gt; mercenary? He&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer.&lt;/i&gt; If the inferno takes him then justice is done. He only has himself to blame.
Now Han, let&apos;s take a look at your nasty leg injury.
*Mirror his anger. It&apos;s time for revenge.*
Shrine to Xantezza
&apos;m I in your way, ma&apos;am?
*Ask for the location of the wreck.*
Trampling all over other people&apos;s lunch! Who ever heard of such a thing? I bet that&apos;s exactly the kind of shenanigans that led Damian down his dark path!
*There&apos;s a moment of silence from within the barrel. Some of the fish seem to shift uncomfortably...*
The One would be humble, just like you.
Gone be hell dragging &apos;em coffers to Arx. Gone be hell &lt;i&gt;getting&lt;/i&gt; to Arx.
*Keep distracting the White Magister. Is that an Order-issued sword she wields?*
*Ask if Reimond is here.*
It would seem difficult to top &apos;using weapons of mass destruction to accidentally unleash an army of the Void.&apos;
*Ask why she kept her own father prisoner here. Didn&apos;t she know what would happen to him?*
If I walk away now, I&apos;m not coming back.
Deal with the Queen and the Deathfog.
*Your scar remains, but at least you&apos;ve a new lead on the Master. Decide to let him live.*
Buyback
We learned that each imprisoned demon is held by chains that are attached to columns of sorts. We should take care before tampering with such devices.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
What if I fall? You do it!
*Sigh.* You stand no chance, but I admire your resilience. &lt;i&gt;Give it your best shot.&lt;/i&gt;
The Lady Vengeance
*Lean in to read the notice.*
Dead Elven Prisoner
Spider Die
Chapel on a Cliff
*Tell her not to mistake your aid for friendship.*
Ts-ts-ts-ts-ts-ts-ts.
Toggle chat
Yes, I know. The opposite is not.
Do shut up, Cecil.
[IFAN] *Offer your sympathy. Lucian committed terrible sins against her people.*
But wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful to be in love?
Eternal Tablet
*Tell him just the ones outside.*
Washboard
*Note that if you were her foe, you&apos;d hardly admit it.*
Don&apos;t worry - he&apos;s well under control. He&apos;s made a fine servant - isn&apos;t that right, ingrate? I used him to find the Aeteran. When we&apos;re done, I&apos;ll release him from his duty and free him from his pain. Until then...
*She takes another swig, then puts the flask away.*
*Its iridescent eyes change shape and flash with greenish flames. It clenches its fists, and the dreaded feeling inside you wells. It&apos;s trying to seize control.*
*Suggest Gareth bring Jonathan to the Lady Vengeance. Perhaps he can be of use.*
*Ifan&apos;s fist connects with Alexandar&apos;s cheekbone and you hear the stomach-curdling crack of bone. Blood streams from Alexandar&apos;s nose, yet he stirs not at all.*
We&apos;ll need supplies. Source-forged steel. War owls. A central command from which to run sorties...
*Tell him the good news: it&apos;s over! Adramahlihk is dead!*
Ah, the fractured Empire. I thank you for showing me what remains. The cruelty of my kin must be undone to honour its memory.
*So Verdas was Godwoken? What does that mean, exactly?*
Moving to corporeal transposition engine!
Which of us is the night, and which the dark, I wonder? Well... whichever it is, I welcome the lack of light, sister.
Our Lord will resurrect the chosen!
It&apos;s working. Good.
*Tell him you killed his comrades, ask him for one good reason why you shouldn&apos;t grant him the same reward.*
*Turn and leave.*
You, Marcus Miles, Beast o&apos; the Sea, the dwarven Divine.
You vile, snivelling little beast.  How dare you.
Towering Statue
*The spirit keeps glancing back. A difficult task, since his shoulders are tense as iron.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Warlord
Search Kemm&apos;s vault for Windego.
*Ask about his home. You can&apos;t imagine how it might have looked.*
*Wave a hand in front of his eyes and ask if Voidwoken caused his death.*
Lord Duna - short and proud. And you passed those traits on to your people. The poor creatures...
Memories... Quite so.
Mmmmm. *Squish* *Squish*
[LOHSE] *Your fans used to toss these on-stage, once upon a time. Smile and say they bring back good memories.*
*Sebille heaves a sigh of satisfaction as she wipes her needle clean.*
Let&apos;s see if you can do better this time. Tell me, &lt;i&gt;Sammy Smartypants&lt;/i&gt;: is there such thing as free will?
I left the Nameless Isle without dealing with the Master.
*Ask him what he knows about the Voidwoken attack.*
Perhaps my honour is all that survives. Let us speak of present matters.
Commiserations, he says! I knew the risks - if graves you&apos;d open, beware the creak and then the click. Then comes the bang! THEN COMES THE BANG! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
*...then dies.*
