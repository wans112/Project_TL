[HERO] *Tell her you want the very best for all peoples.*
Game Menu
*The lid of the urn shakes slightly, then creaks open. Within lies curled the limp form of Sir Lora... and Quercus&apos; tangled bones.*
I&apos;m doing my best with what I have, Miss. Here, see for yourself.
*Tell him you&apos;ll look for the remaining piece.*
*Isbeil intrudes before the queen can speak.*
To think I trusted a traitor. I thought him a friend; a protector of the city, yet all the while he was trying to gain entry to the tomb. To Lucian&apos;s body...
Ahhhhhhh... life is good.
But maybe I can help you out... if you&apos;ve the coin. Trinkets and wonders I have here in my pack. For the smallest of costs, I tell you. Barely a trifle...
Squeeeeek squeaky?
*Her people? You didn&apos;t meet them on your travels.*
*Source snakes from your eyes and fingers and into his - and you are Jonathan, clad in Red Magisters&apos; garb, righteous and ready.*
Of course - he&apos;s the commander of the White Magisters in Arx.
Huge Fire Resistance Potion
*Say you&apos;re looking for a set of lost oranges. Ring any bells?*
A character with [1] cannot be Knocked Down.
*Wonder how he avoided Magister persecution - they controlled the city until recently, after all.*
Find Roost.
I know little of dwarven death rituals. What role does this woman play?
...
No. What I &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; seen is too many forked tongues and flaking scales.
*The executioner&apos;s face is as empty as Void itself as he swings.*
But... I&apos;m bloody &lt;i&gt;thrilled &lt;/i&gt;to be here now. Just me, myself, and... you, of course.
I reached a new level of mastery over my Source powers, thanks to the demonic Advocate. I grow ever closer to fulfilling my destiny.
Amber Ring
Soon enough, we&apos;ll become &lt;i&gt;divine.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask if she truly remembers nothing about Mordus&apos; takeover.*
We are in your hands, Scion. You are the last. Do what you must do - but then lead us to safety. Lead us to bliss.
But I saw shinies. They fell on the ground. Trampled on by salamanders. They came for the meat.
Although perhaps you would be interested in a companion of another sort?
Heh. Don&apos;t thank me. Not while &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;thing&apos;s still knockin&apos; around yer buddy&apos;s nut.
Amadia truly is the mother of all magic, the patron of all who use Source...
*You turn around and take two steps before turning back and looking him in the eyes.*
Rope
*First things first: what in the name of the Seven is fang-play?*
This temple was a fortress. My traps made it untouchable, unpassable. That weasel - that &lt;i&gt;Sallow Man &lt;/i&gt;- he responded not with strength, but with soggy cowardice, and made me look the fool. &lt;i&gt;Face me, you milk-livered mouse!&lt;/i&gt;
Sash
We left Fort Joy without visiting the arena.
Well look at this. Did you think you could get away with it? Face the consequences!
Lone Wolf leader Roost Anlon is holed up with his band in a nearby sawmill. He&apos;ll know who ordered Sahelia&apos;s death.
Yes. No. Definitely no.
Reclaim the mask.
*Take the yarrow plant from your pouch and offer it to him.*
*As Sebille&apos;s hands traipse their way down, a sound emanates in the distance.*
Oh! I surely do, sweetheart!
Glad to see you&apos;re still kicking, at least, though I should warn you: Arx kicks back.
Ten years of service, and this is where they stick me...
All this trouble... and for &lt;i&gt;nothing. &lt;/i&gt;Never figured I&apos;d need frost armour...
*Wink and tell her you need the money for a gift... for a beautiful woman.*
Maybe you&apos;ll find some in the garden. Or maybe &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; soul will help the next adventurer through.
*Take your leave.*
How superb! I harbour some hope that Amadia may still bless me. Make me a little less piggy, a little more wizardly, you know?
[NOBLE] *Mull the name over before it hits you: This is the dwarf who rebelled against his Queen! What cheek!*
*Say you love it when she smiles at you like that. You wonder what you did to earn it.*
*He tears another page from the book and tosses it over the side with a sigh.*
*Brace yourself to take the blow.*
*Noise erupts in the Undertavern around you, as patrons jeer and clap your affectionate moment. Ifan meets your eyes and laughs softly, pulling you into a bear hug.*
You&apos;ve done it. I can hardly believe it. So long, it&apos;s been... the length of millennia within these stone walls. You did what I could not.
[1] doesn&apos;t need to be identified
Ugh.
Ha! You think you could get away with that? You&apos;re so naive it&apos;s almost adorable!
&apos;Threat detected. Executing system extirpation.&apos;
*Despite centuries of neglect, the light still glows with the unmistakeable brilliance of Source.*
[SEBILLE] *State that you sense more than mere callousness in his words... you detect a plotting mind. He&apos;s up to something, isn&apos;t he?*
*Take your leave.*
A box with various supplies in it.
Medium Strength Potion
You don&apos;t have enough money for this!
*She babbles breathlessly on, barely aware you&apos;re there. And nearby sounds a ringing bell...*
No necklace.  Some things that don&apos;t look like they belong to you, but no necklace.
*...CLICK...*
Heh. You thought you could get away with it, huh? Well, off to prison with you!
Magical Wand Of The Dwarf
It&apos;s best to snuff the candles. They&apos;re feeding a demon, after all.
At this rate there&apos;ll be no steak for Lucian&apos;s Day.
Black Ring experiments in Arx. If Lucian was alive he&apos;d raze the place.
*Ask why he wanted to save that elf from the thugs.*
They were just there... just there but a moment ago...
*Admire the bow. Ask if he has other supplies that might interest an archer.*
Jellyfish Skin Skillbook
Elven Cutlass
I will return to the kingdom. I have much to atone for.
*It floods your body with light at once boiling hot and freezing cold. You feel his hands press on your garb, and you move together, entwined in spirit as one...*
Twist, the Knife
It&apos;s you... God...&lt;i&gt;woken...&lt;/i&gt; The demon, Adramahlihk... Too powerful... Possessed...
Burning Voidwoken. The stink upsets me and I don&apos;t know why.
*This is no time for idle chit chat. Turn and walk away.*
Lightning Ball
Mabel, you&apos;re such a cow.
They lied! I can&apos;t believe it... I mean, of course they lied to you, look at you - but they also lied to &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
It is simplicity itself: they will bow to you, or be undone!
Or, indeed, you could stand there, still as a boiled lobster. You seem to have mastered that look.
*Braccus Rex&apos;s high judge hands you his sceptre. Then he bows his head, steps away... and vanishes back into the ether.*
*Ask where Brahmos went.*
Looks like you&apos;ve already got a full pack. But I&apos;m all yours if you ditch one.
Truly beautiful. Poetry on the page.
Investigate Bloodmoon Island.
Stayin&apos; out of trouble, I hope?
A vile-scented draught capable of dimming your perception.
Defeat the Shriekers.
*Thank her for everything she&apos;s done for you.*
Hurry back. The eyebrows still need plucking.
*Reach out too, and grasp the spear.*
*The log takes a breath. A great slab of the finest livewood bark slides free - ornate and glowing with Source. It is the spirit&apos;s gift to you - a second skin. The wounded bark heals.*
That bastard was just using us to get a fix...
Hidden Alcove
Unconscious
*Adopt Almira&apos;s tone. Tell the captain that he speaks to you through your thrall, and he is not to be&lt;i&gt; interfered with.*&lt;/i&gt;
Another day, another ridiculous fable. Come on. Prison&apos;s waiting!
*Pull on the red lever.*
Come, I&apos;ve just the spot for us.
Cloth
Where I thought I would find crude violence, I found - actually, crude violence was rather accurate...
The eight-pointed star depicted on this finely-crafted amulet (considered heretical by the Church of the Seven) represents the Seven Gods and the one oversoul that unites them with humanity.
Nothin&apos; wrong with the classics! Everyone&apos;s got a melody in &apos;em - ya just gotta look. Me brother Laslor couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket when he were a wee thing. Now, he&apos;s got the voice of an angel.
High Quality Shadow Essence
|Marked Place|
&lt;i&gt;Yeeeaaaarrgh! &lt;/i&gt;Stop! P-please stop! The pain... it&apos;s too much!
But of course we can&apos;t, can we? How perfectly horrid.
Not your place to ask such questions. Not my place to answer them.
I do not play this silly game!
*Her gaze swivels around the room.*
Black Ring forces have invaded the Nameless Isle. They may not be friendly.
*Bow mysteriously and say that sounds wonderful.*
Stay if you must. But do not touch anything!
You&apos;re... you&apos;re the best damned friend I&apos;ve ever had.
Still, do not underestimate my presence. This is a place of incredible power, where a single prayer holds the weight of thousands. So I will pray for you. Your heart and soul will fill as quickly as they&apos;re drained.
[The letter pulses as if possessing a heartbeat, and glows with pale light.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Children of the God King:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The priests are in disarray and the tree is soon to give up its secrets. It is time to descend upon Bloodmoon Island. The demons would bar the way with Deathfog - but I dare say the unliving among you should have no trouble passing, nor should those with a gift for surviving such toxins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go. It is your desire and your duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The missive is signed with a single letter: S.]
And how do you know that, exactly? Did your queen tell you? In the same breath she insisted Source &lt;i&gt;wasn&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;causing this mess? There&apos;s no saving us...
Oh, but certainly. As it happens he&apos;s coming by for afternoon tea.
Thrall
You honour us during the ritual. You honour Sarias. You help remember him. You help bury him.
*Stare into the statue&apos;s eyes. There is magic in them.*
I see the good in you. I see your hope.
Small Rock Rune Of Power
And &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;one.
Orb
[VILLAIN] *Laugh at her. &lt;i&gt;Loser.*&lt;/i&gt;
You&apos;re nothing but a sad, little creep desperate to be something more than you are.
My, the giant takes notice of its charges!
Stand with Alexandar.
Useless.
*Take your leave.*
[HUMAN] *Say you come to him as a kinsman seeking guidance.*
*The girl rocks slowly with the roll of the ship in the waves. Under her breath she&apos;s singing &apos;whisht bonnie bairn, now don&apos;t you cry, the birds are asleep and the moon&apos;s in the sky...&apos;*
*Ask his name.*
Thunderbolt Trap
*Very well. Thank her for her time and take your leave.*
*Bow slightly, never taking your eyes off her. Is she truly one of his people?*
Very well... I&apos;ll spare your craven, worthless life... now get out of my sight!
Undead Lizard Rogue
Elemental
I hear there is safety in numbers. I&apos;m not sure what number exactly, but perhaps we should remain together for the immediate future?
Your eyes brim with inquiry. So ask.
*Sigh. Only thing you&apos;ve heard so far are vague conjectures. Is he not in enough pain?*
I suppose we could p-probably spare two Seekers...
When you&apos;re ready, speak with the figurehead.
*Calmly tell her it&apos;s time to return to herself.*
Turns out, the folks &apos;round Reaper&apos;s Cove don&apos;t take too kindly to Magisters sneakin&apos; about. &apos;specially not the dwarven kind. One of &apos;em was here, tending to the fire. Got me &apos;fore I got him.
The Holy Hand Grenade
Really? Aww man. I wish&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;was friends with a half-demon!
*The Magister loses some of his bluster.*
*Beast thrusts his weapon at his fellow dwarf, who looks first to you, then to Beast. He&apos;s surprisingly unfazed by the obvious threat.*
We seek Sourcerers with special talents and see if we can keep them alive. In that spirit, I suggest you find somewhere else to be.
I know you seek answers. I&apos;ll tell you what I can.
