Because of the shadows, Your Highness. The manifold shadows... Many long hours I have passed here, waiting for your royal self to break through the smoke.
We lose our forests to poachers, to the fog, to the Divine Order. We lose each other to the wars. A Scion is our only hope to survive. To build again.
I suspect you know yourself by yet another name, however. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
These Void-tainted little tootsies smell none too sweet.

Decomposing Battlemage
Cat the Appraiser
With Lucian gone, the elves reluctantly rejoined the Divine Alliance.
Incinerator Control Valve
*Shrug. You&apos;re good at fighting, but there&apos;s more to life than battle.*
*Call out to her.*
I cannot sit here and just wish for death. I must carry on. For my people. For my family.
Oh, that&apos;s what you want, is it? Well, come get it!
*Say you don&apos;t know him terribly well. He&apos;s more of an acquaintance.*
*Kneel down and tell her you&apos;re sorry for what happened to her master, and you aren&apos;t here to hurt her or anyone else.*
This doesn&apos;t feel like any power I know. This feels... &lt;i&gt;dangerous.&lt;/i&gt;
Fine then! I never liked you anyway.
Trumpet Of Death
Battle Gauntlets
You can take this pain away. You can end it right now.
*Change your mind about that drink and take your leave.*
Medat&apos;s Aromatic Journal
Alva Vinter
&lt;i&gt;Glechou dumar&lt;/i&gt;. May you find the rest in the Halls that you could not in this life...
*Stop where you are and say that you don&apos;t want to fight - you just want to talk.*
Truth be told, it scares the hell out of me to think you&apos;d toss me overboard, just like that.
Mouldering Clubber
*Lie and say you didn&apos;t. You&apos;re a strong swimmer, though; you made it to shore alright.*
Well I wouldn&apos;t have said so if they didn&apos;t. Can&apos;t eat, sadly: food goes right through you. Too bad, too, since those fiery hogs gave me a hankering for a good pork stew.
Gods! So many have fallen... but the ship is ours.
Glory
I&apos;m hungry too. Le&apos;zzz go. You can play with imp thing now. &apos;zzz got starzzz in.
*You see him deep in a cave, using Source to break through a magical barrier. Trying. Failing. Trying again. Failing, in exhaustion.*
*The pig is clearly getting worked up. She seems on the verge of racing away.*
But! I suppose I might be swayed to forgiveness by the other little Godwoken morsels you&apos;ve brought me...
Very well then, but as you lack the glowing eyes of the Divine, or the purpose of one soon-to-be-Divine, I trust you need more Source?
*Apologise to the Voidwo - to the &lt;i&gt;Eternal&lt;/i&gt;. You never meant for anyone to suffer.*
A Hunter of Wicked Things
*Sneer that for a prince, downfall and death are all too closely related. If he failed how will he make up for it?*
*This soul is of no concern to you. Drain it of its Source.*
*He walks toward her; they talk in low tones. Jahan&apos;s face is vivid, insistent; Lohse&apos;s is set to a determined frown.*
You must go the Blackpits. There&apos;s a cavern there. In it, you&apos;ll find a stone tablet of considerable value.
I considered her... but she only fights in the arena, and blood she spills there is fair game. No... something doesn&apos;t fit...
Remember what I said - head north to our rendezvous point. If the others made it, I&apos;ll wager it&apos;s the safest place to be right now.
But you weren&apos;t a lost child, were you? You weren&apos;t an innocent at all.
Bone Cage
&lt;b&gt;You must seek to torment her too. Every time you draw near, she screams and pleads. The terror of the pure is beautiful.&lt;/b&gt;
Only a fool would continue to obey the will of a liar. If we meet the Gods again, we have to get answers.
*Turn heel and flee.*
We killed Lohar - the best lead Beast had in his quest to disrupt Operation Downfall.
Go on - go - swim or drown or do whatever takes your fancy. I have a book to read.
*It floods your body with light at once boiling hot and freezing cold. You feel her hands press on your garb, and you move together, entwined in spirit as one...*
I hear he avoids Lucian&apos;s tough-maker, the Path of Blood. He is a defiler of Lucian&apos;s will, shine-beast. The crypt waits for only Divine-devout-devoted. It is not an easy-make trial.
*He snatches the letter from your hand and skims through it with mounting indignation.*
Gonna eat them were you, you damned savage?
So long as you do not pledge allegiance to the Ring, we can talk. Perhaps even trade.
The skull truly says it all.
I know Damian was only a baby, but still, Lucian was too soft.
Flatbow
AWOO! Sound the alarm!
Away with ya, reddy.
*Ask him if he thinks he really is the One.*
Shocking Arrowhead
You make me yawn with these trivialities.
Adept Witch
Unable to move or dodge. Cannot be targeted by teleportation skills. Removed by Burning, Necrofire, Holy Fire.
Do you yearn for the Void, Paladin? Confess your sins!
*You&apos;re done talking. Take the Black Ring warrior down.*
&lt;i&gt;Give yourself to me now, child. Give yourself to Amadia, body and soul.&lt;/i&gt;
Yes, milady. She &lt;i&gt;jests.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrug and say that you haven&apos;t decided yet.*
*Lay a hand on your weapon and say that she&apos;s just about to tell you.*
I wish I&apos;d possessed your willpower. But the God King... he&apos;s a powerful drug, and the Black Ring is no more than a band of junkies.
Amadia&apos;s altar is at the highest point. Climb to the sky and you may find it. But be warned... Amadia rarely answers now. And when she does, she sounds... unwell. May she speak to you with love.
dss
*Ask what he knows about the Magisters and their &apos;cure&apos; for Sourcerers.*
*Scoff that none of that matters - the cook was a murderer, and you expect a reward for putting a stop to her.*
I know. I know it is not easy. But it gets better. You see.
But I do know that I&apos;m happier now than I&apos;ve ever been in my life. You make me feel like... like I have a voice. Like I&apos;m not just a host. Like I&apos;m a real person.
I intend to be a particular kind of husband. And I could use someone with &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;particular talents to help me achieve this.
Persuade this character by &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Charming&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Intimidating&lt;/font&gt;, or &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Reasoning&lt;/font&gt;. If your Perception is high enough, you can see in brackets what answer grants the highest bonus.
*That dark shadow crosses his face once more. He shivers.*
I know it goes without saying, ben-Mezd, but... don&apos;t get caught.
*The plaque reads &lt;i&gt;&apos;4: Loyalty to the Divine&apos;.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Apologise; say you&apos;ll listen; you&apos;re all ears; you want to talk.*
[NOBLE] *Tell her you sense a kindred spirit. You&apos;re not at home camping in caves either.*
This and that... little tidbits... hands... feet... an eyeball now and then...
It was she who uncovered our plot against Braccus Rex. And she who laughed as he tortured us.
*He spits - sending a brown glob sailing dangerously close to your boot.*
A&apos;ight. Jus&apos; make sure to keep the blindfold &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt;. Ya take it off, ya lose the challenge. Real simple.
Arx was abandoned to the Deathfog and the dead. In time, the great city, memorial to Lucian the Divine, faded from memory, forgotten by the world.
&apos;The Mortall Remain&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; of Sar Ballys.&apos;
*Smile and ask if she has a riddle for you.*
Get out of here, okay? We never met. No-one has to know.
Baaaaaaa! &lt;i&gt;Mbaaaaaaaaaaaa!&lt;/i&gt;
You wad of bloody snotscum! Hand it over. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
For my collection?
You LAWK-LAWK-&lt;i&gt;lie!&lt;/i&gt;
Too late. You can&apos;t slap away the truth.
Bring her to her knees. DO IT!
*A fisherman stares at the water, muttering to himself.*
Same reason I&apos;ll rip your scalp from your head, actually. Someone paid me good money to. &lt;i&gt;Two &lt;/i&gt;someones, actually. Times&apos;re good.
*Order her on the attack. &lt;i&gt;Now!*&lt;/i&gt;
Do whatever you want. I have no idea where your lousy crate is.
Do I look like I&apos;m going to cry on your shoulder? Go do your shopping or whatever it is you&apos;re here for. We&apos;re done.
She&apos;s free from the Covenant. But something tells me the God King&apos;s gaze remains upon her.
You are a female of one of the races; you are perceived as female by those that encounter you.
Insert Rune
[IFAN] *Wink and tell her you&apos;ve come back to finish the job.*
*Visitors? Ask who comes to see Ryker.*
Arx
A letter written hastily, and never sent.
Tiffany Denise Howard
And to try to stop me from killing Alexandar? The architect of our misfortune? The man I tracked half-the-godsdamned-way across Rivellon? For &lt;i&gt;what?&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask her if &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; thinks you seem different.*
Exactly!
*Wonder how she died.*
You were just itching for a fight, weren&apos;t you?
You must be punished.
I... I swear, I don&apos;t know. Maybe he went to his house? It&apos;s over by the barracks! Just don&apos;t hurt my family...
*Say the whole point of getting out of Fort Joy is finding a way to get your passenger out of you. Of course it worries you.*
Shriekers. Make my blood run cold.
*The Magister grabs the coin and looks around shiftily, then turns back to you.*
So much potential, but still so&lt;i&gt; naive&lt;/i&gt;. It is my very business to know things, dwarf.
Know-It-All
I can already feel a bloody headache coming along, and your yapping isn&apos;t helping it. Go on, push off!
Corpse Explosion Wood Medium
My closest kin are gone, their ancestor trees felled. The Magisters took everything from me.
Sure. Just don&apos;t get too cosy. If you&apos;re smart, you won&apos;t stay here too long.
Pssst! You there, c&apos;mere!
*Stare. She could restore the forests of your homeland?*
I am whole. &lt;i&gt;We are One.&lt;/i&gt;
Only the elven Godwoken who did not ascend could save them now.
Avenger
*He&apos;s relieved.*
With a new Divine at the helm, Malady had a powerful ally. But... she was in no hurry to call in her favour. After all, it might be the last thing she ever did.
Bye. And... thanks.
Greetings! It&apos;s a brave traveller indeed who takes this road. It&apos;s a braver one who crosses the bridge and travels east. You have my admiration; it&apos;s a hellscape out there.
*Press him again.&lt;i&gt; Who is he?*&lt;/i&gt;
Channeling
No, becoming the Divine means taking on the power of all the Gods, &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;the responsibility for all the races.
Info
*Lady Kemm grins, then pours you yet another cup of tea.*
&lt;b&gt;Aetera, you worm! An eternity locked away was too good for you - I should have seen you ground to dust and fed to the wind. Your heresies deserve nothing less.&lt;/b&gt;
Wait! Before you go...
Even if I knew how to rip that thing off, I wouldn&apos;t. Some crazy banshee comes screamin&apos; through, and now we got Void bugs swarming up top. Sourcerer mutiny!
Marg&apos;s Troll Bridge
Kraken Die
*Tell the spirit that the dwarves were concealing a cache of Deathfog - they unleashed it and devastated Arx.*
*Demand that Ryker teach you the ways of Source. You&apos;re owed that much.*
I&apos;m on the search for missing goods. Mind if I take a look through all of your bags?
Find out what can be made upon the forge.
*Say you&apos;ll fold.*
How much you can do in one turn.
No matter. Farewell, stranger.
Gotta hand it to &apos;em, elves sure smell better than us when they die. Kinda like fall leaves, y&apos;know?
If you&apos;re going to pray, now&apos;s the time.
*Ask him what more he wants to know.*
You do not understand. The trees are the great wisdom. The great mothers. The trees will bring us where we must go.
*Sigh* ...hehe... Well. Anyway. You were sayin&apos;?
Mystical Gloves
&lt;i&gt;*Own&lt;/i&gt; it.*
