If it&apos;s all getting to be a bit too much, remember that you can always modify the difficulty level from your Game Options menu. Even in the middle of an ongoing game.
I think back and realise - a dead Divine never had answers. The wind carried my words to nowhere and everywhere, but certainly not to Lucian&apos;s ears. Even so, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready to trust myself. Not yet.
You have to stay dead, Alexandar!
Lute
Empathetic, as always. You have achieved much, despite your obvious flaws. I&apos;m proud of you. But you can do better.
Rusted Bell
*You place a bucket underneath her and begin to milk. She doesn&apos;t complain; apparently, your hands are warm enough.*
*She sees Fane approach and punches her fist in his direction. Her face flushes red. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; - the one that destroyed the ship to Fort Joy.*
[SCHOLAR] *Consider Tarquin. He knows the demonic tongue?*
*Her eyes lock with the hollows in your skull. She sees who - what - you are, but if she is bothered, she gives no sign. Her lids are heavy, her lips are moist.*
*You take your time trying to open the lock, but to no avail.*
Might want to hoist your pants on the way in, Voidwoken ichor&apos;s a right bitch to clean off.
Steam Profile
*Frown. Aren&apos;t you already a Source Master?*
|Target(s) will be pushed away from point of impact by up to [1]m|
Of course. You are but a mortal - for now. But you are Godwoken as well. Surely you have a few tricks up your sleeve.
Excellent! Pleasure doing business with you.
Lizard Dagger
*The Magister coughs and splutters as the potion slides down his throat. His eyes focus on you - then fill with fear.*
Darling dear, dear darling child. Hello, yarrow girl... Can it really be you?
I find that bad luck tends to happen to those who make bad choices.
Don&apos;t you understand? You&apos;re so dangerous. It isn&apos;t your fault, but you are. If you leave this place, you could bring a Voidwoken on your head at any time.
No! Have you lost your -
*Consume her Source. This witch deserves no better.*
GRRRRR.
Armour
It&apos;s ripping the ship apart!
Now &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; monkfish, one that&apos;s been touched by the Void itself... who&apos;s to say how its flesh could augment an intelligence brew? It could prove to be most valuable...
*The cub sobs and shakes its head.*
We found the heroes&apos; treasure.
Peace of Mind Scroll
*The hanging Sourcerer winks at you, and another strand of rope falls away. He&apos;ll soon be free.*
Thank you kindly, sweetheart. I do appreciate it. They were good lads. Too good for this place. In some ways I&apos;m glad they got out quickly.
*The hound raises its nose from the deck and growls threateningly.*
Back again, honey? What&apos;re you after?
Ice Fan Scroll
Elven Stew
I faced a hell scarcely to be imagined, but you, torch-bearer, led me out of the dark. You are stronger than any demon, Lohse. You always were.
Flaming Axe
Haunted Tower
*Ask what happened.*
A Sourceress, as it happens. A master of portals - and a lizard too. She seems unable to escape - thank the Divine - but we can&apos;t get close enough to bring her down.
*Tell her she was under Mordus&apos; evil influence. Luckily, the priest has been killed.*
*Grin and observe that if the merchant dies, he&apos;ll surely leave his estate to his daughter.*
Well, why didn&apos;t you say? I had no idea!
Ryker&apos;s Journal
Just say the word, and our journey shall continue.
Magisters&apos; Lab
*Remind him you came for information. Ask him what he knows about the Sourcerers who may be able to help you.*
*Quietly leave the two of them alone.*
But I am a Knight of Vrogir. I stand vigil. I do not know what became of them.
There&apos;s soul in these sails; life in the planks underfoot. I&apos;m going to have a look around. Alone.
Yes, yes, yes! He wanders. He RAWK-&lt;i&gt;roosts&lt;/i&gt;. But he is... special. He can help Peeper. Can keep him safe!
Washing Tub
The Magisters have us cornered - they have these... &lt;i&gt;weapons &lt;/i&gt;called Shriekers. If we try to go against them unprepared, we&apos;re dead. We&apos;ve lost many already.
*Draw your weapon. This kid will go down easily.*
We entered the Academy. The Arena of the One awaits, where those who seek Divinity must prove their worth.
You&apos;re still the natural choice.
At last, we reached our goal. Together we entered Lucian&apos;s tomb.
Have a look yourself, miss! I think the traitor is still there. In a somewhat... changed condition.
*You stab the shopkeeper in the heart and flee.*
You say nothing, yet I can &lt;i&gt;hear &lt;/i&gt;it.  I hear it in every rustle underfoot, every breath you take.
I&apos;ll slay every Magister from here to high heaven if they stand in my path again. It&apos;s good to be free of them.
Malady appeared aboard the Lady Vengeance and rescued me. Once more, we retreated into the Hall of Echoes. The Council of Seven was lost, our plans were in disarray, while Dallis had thwarted our efforts by purging the Wellspring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remained bound to the will of the God King, but perhaps if I could reclaim the powers from Dallis, I could still defeat him. But why did Dallis seize the powers in the first place? Was she a fellow agent of the Void? Did she think her actions were somehow righteous? Or was it a simple lust for power?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the Hammer herself could answer such questions. Malady believed that Dallis would likely make her way to Arx, where the remains of Lucian were interred. If she had plans for the powers of the Divine, then they likely involved the last person to wield them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so the Lady Vengeance cut a path through the Hall of Echoes, setting a course for Arx. I enjoyed the respite while I could, for I sensed that the end was drawing near.
My child! Help my child, I beg you!
Ho, dragonkin! Come, come! I know this hellish place seems devoid of welcome.
Free. Free at last...
*Say you&apos;re glad they&apos;re doing well here, because you&apos;d heard that Seekers had attacked Fort Joy.*

Magisters - Normal
Ripped Page
You. Over here.
She told me this even as flames and Voidwoken engulfed our consulate. I pray the Dreamers brought her to safety; that it is not too late for you and her to meet!
*The God thrashes against your control. You can feel it hissing that this creature is dangerous - that it cannot be trusted.*
Spiderweb
What? No, it can&apos;t be - you cheated!
*Leaving.*
We came across a strange and ancient lamp.
Never pegged him for a pinhead, just a prickhead.
UI Radial Down
And I thought I knew my husband... clearly not, if he managed to have a, a... &lt;i&gt;lair of treachery&lt;/i&gt; right beneath our own home!
We got a system. And it looks like &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;don&apos;t want to fit in.
No idea. But Gods know Dallis had us on a tight schedule. &apos;Faster!&apos; &apos;We&apos;re getting close!&apos; Easy for her to say. She might be called &apos;The Hammer&apos;, but I never saw &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; walloping away at the rocks.
That&apos;s it! NO MORE!
*Say that you didn&apos;t pass comment.*
Giant Blood Demon
*The reaver begins to laugh, tossing the heart from one hand to the other like a ball.*
No! An impostor is he... A Lone Wolf in my own sheep&apos;s clothing...
Ancient things cling to our bones like earth to roots. They will be yours. For coin. For coin.
*Take a step closer and urge him to make haste.*
Jonathan&apos;s Ring
*Gareth greets you warmly. He&apos;s oddly chipper - more chipper than you&apos;ve ever seen him, and certainly more chipper than most people mourning dead loved ones.*
*The Magister&apos;s eyes flick to a nearby pile of fish and he moves off to investigate.*
*His memory comes to you like a hound to its master. Your name is Raedalus and you are Godwoken - but you know that you can never be Divine. You are in love with Taryan, your rival, and that love makes you weak.*
*She puts on a sympathetic pout (of little sincerity) and slowly waves you goodbye.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
[This report details the many and varied ways in which the dwarves are suspected of plotting a pre-emptive attack on the Divine order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following strict military protocol, the author of the report suggests the Order bide their time and wait to see what the next dwarven move may be...]
*Apologise for disturbing him and walk away.*
*Say you&apos;ve cared about him since you met him on the ship to Fort Joy. You didn&apos;t leave him behind then, and you&apos;re not going to leave him behind now - but he has to trust &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;to ascend.*
*Ask what crime saw this Meistr brought so low... or so high.*
But somethin&apos; tells me it&apos;s all gonna be okay.

Minus
A potion that enchants and strengthens your Magic Armour.
And even when I stood before you, begging you to let me attempt an exorcism that might save my life, you refused me. And for what reason?
Dwarven Form
Some peace and quiet would certainly be a good start. After that... who knows?
No surprise that the Voidwoken attacked the lizard embassy first. Them Dreamers use Source, I&apos;m tellin&apos; ya..
Character&apos;s Source Points are being drained.
She&apos;s Malady, the one and only. She is greater, I dare say, than we dare dream.
I know a safe place nearby, away from the creatures of the meadows. I&apos;ll take him there. He&apos;ll be untouched until he wakes.
Still, you look like you&apos;ve got something to hide.
[LOHSE] *Assume a persona. Say your name is Magister... Singer.*
The Shadow Prince told me that I must kill Sadha. The Sallow Man&apos;s magic mirrors will show me where she is now.
You&apos;ll get nothing out of me - &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.
What news of Gwydian Rince? Have you found him?
Pipe to the Swamp
This oughtta be interesting. Let&apos;s go find a graveyard!
Malady&apos;s war owl summoned us back to the Lady Vengeance.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the spirit of Mudbarrow behind us.
This character doesn&apos;t like you, and won&apos;t trade. &lt;br&gt;A gift or donation may improve their attitude.
*Tell her you&apos;re not sure you want to know.*
Right. I&apos;ll do that. Thanks, chief.
*Summon the great well of Source within you and cast bless on Malady.*
Wait. no - &lt;i&gt;please!&lt;/i&gt;

*He gives you a long, hard look. Then he turns away. But he does not show you his back, and he keeps one hand on the hilt of his sword.*
Oh that! Didn&apos;t I mark it on your map? It&apos;s near the windmill out in the meadows. Pretty spot, you&apos;ll like it.
I... don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t know! Oh Duna&apos;s beard, &lt;i&gt;Lohar&lt;/i&gt;. My b-b-boss Lohar will want to know what happened to them, but I... I can&apos;t remember.
State your business to Magister Carver, or else get out.
I wouldn&apos;t use this garbage against my worst enemies. Some lines ought never to be crossed.
You! Get your portion whence, not during!
Malady&apos;s Beacon
The chef? What tripe - that waif can barely carve a ham. And murderer or not, Higba is still a Sourcerer. He &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be caught.
*Your fingers go rigid. &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt; doesn&apos;t want to see the lute fixed. Your body goes rigid.*
