Anyway, as &apos;interesting&apos; as that cold hellscape might have been, it does not solve our problem. We are here to stop the Great Acorn, not hide from it.
Rolled-Up Vines
White Magister Jonathan hasn&apos;t told us what he&apos;s doing here. We should keep searching.
Acid-Stained Key
*Ask what more he can tell you about Mordus.*
Hail, friend, and remember: In Lucian&apos;s love there can be no wrong.
I&apos;m told Justinia is safe, thank the Gods, though whether she&apos;s still inside after all the commotion, I can&apos;t say. I pray Ros found her a suitable hiding place.
*He gives you a cool look. Then he purses his lips as he decides what to do. Then he lunges for his sword.*
*You see a man, well-fed and wealthy - but stress has lined his face and narrowed his waist. He seems to be expecting you. He offers you a large and rusted key.*
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there, frog-legs. Jonathan&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt he&apos;ll be caring much who or what he slices.
*Warn him that as he dithers, the price goes up.*
Hurry now. It won&apos;t be long.
Destroyed Painting
*You want more.*
*The craft! The detail! You could spend the rest of your life here. Then your longing is crushed underfoot.*
Canvas
*He&apos;ll teach you to channel your Source right now? Sure, you agree.*
The Shield wants us to hide, Quercus? As if there were any such option. The Great Acorn will destroy &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
Magic Armour:
Lavender Necklace
How unbearably beautiful it is, having to dream no longer.
You need to understand something. A cataclysm is coming. Either you help &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;help &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; to stop it, or we stand idle while the shadows engulf us.
*One of the scouts saw him heading south in the direction of the graveyard. That&apos;s all he knows.*
Medusa Head Scroll
Agreed. And, my friend, when it comes to Lohar, &lt;i&gt;so should you.&lt;/i&gt;
Lagan left his over-demanding wife and began a relationship with a local bard. In the spirit of loving generosity, he returned the ring to his now ex-wife. In a fit of rage, she threw it into the sea.
*Tell him you don&apos;t have time for this and bid him farewell.*
*Between them the wargs tear the food apart, then wolf it down. They look up at you, hungry for more.*
*Alright. Yes. But, you tell the rat, you&apos;re not stupid.*
*Write &apos;Darling&apos;.*
*Confide that you sometimes wonder whether you&apos;ve made the right choice in such a companion.*
Stand back, there, short-stuff.
You... you.... damned you!
Hannag&apos;s Bargain
You don&apos;t want an enemy of the Captain.
Death brings me here. My parents&apos; death. At the hands of the man I once called friend.
No doubt in my mind.
Maybe I don&apos;t.
Brutal warrior and expert in close combat
*Tell her you aren&apos;t sure. How many more of these are there going to be?*
Runes
B-bloody f-f-freezing! I&apos;ve g-gotta get out of here!
*Give him the bad news. His friend Jonathan ordered his parents dead.*
Attack with your currently equipped weapon.
Mordus was feeding off the lich&apos;s Source. For the lich, it was torture.
...loyal and hungry. Go now. Save your questions for master. Spare me your presence.
Hush, Fedor. You may pass, lizard. Dare say you&apos;ll be aching to leave before long, anyway. But... before you do, find Reimond, the White Magister. He&apos;ll want to know what you&apos;ve seen.
Please, come in... oh DO make yourself at home, won&apos;t you?
I wish, friend. But there ain&apos;t nothing you can do, and there ain&apos;t nothing I can do.
You mean to say that carrot-cutting, cow-cooking elf has been killing Magisters? The fiend! Magister Carver must know of this! He&apos;s the one leading the investigation. Go on: go tell him post-haste!
A powerful assassin whose arsenal of both daggers and magic would terrify any enemy, if they ever saw it coming.
Very well, given that you&apos;re not a smouldering pile of ash I assume the ritual was a success. But... it was your Source, wasn&apos;t it? You are not strong enough to become the Divine.
Ancient Stone Hatch
For you, &lt;i&gt;rav&lt;/i&gt;, no bother. As your discount&apos;s still a go, it&apos;ll be cheap... if you have the coin, of course. (cheap [GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
*Pull away and leave her be.*
Well. I see no reason to mince words, Godwoken. You&apos;re here to die.
Mutiny?
A strong, promising bar of iron, the core ingredient of any well-made steel.
None of us was champion of the arena in Driftwood.
My King... Even tainted by the Void, I would sooner bow to His Majesty once more than Seven lords that doomed us to this.
*The flower&apos;s sweet fragrance fills the air.*
Just you try judging the state of a Verdistian armoire if you&apos;re not even allowed to rummage through its drawers.
Lead the way.
No, no - I don&apos;t cotton to violence. There are other ways. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find one.
*Tell her you&apos;re right behind her.*
And now, I break his shackles and end this misery. No goodbye has ever been sweeter.
I understand. The past can be a painful place to visit. Maybe another time...
*The spirit gazes at you joylessly.*
[BARBARIAN] *Barrel forward. And who&apos;s going to stop you?*
You want me to drag a White across the coast in viewing distance of a dozen Magisters, and get a tongue-lashing from Malady as reward? I have not lost &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; sense, I assure you.
I finally understand! Sadha... My word, yes, we will be one!
When you put on this armour, your heart beats like the wings of a thousand birds ready to take flight.
And to think people call &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;kind savages... I never heard of elves hacking each other to pieces in the middle of their villages...
*You cast a loving glance over her body, still soft with sleep. How you wish you could stay here forever.*
*Say you&apos;re still thinking about it.*
Toggle the Mood Panel
According to Malady, I must now seek out Meistr of the Seekers. She lives in the port of Driftwood, along Reaper&apos;s Coast.
*A rough-looking dwarf gazes over the side of the bridge at bloody wreckage below. Her eyes are shielded, but she seems unable to look away until you break her reverie.*
It wouldn&apos;t have changed anything. Dallis wasn&apos;t going to let any of us take what she wanted. And now... here we are.
[IFAN] *Reach out too, and grasp the spear.*
Oozes - Any
Well - you shouldn&apos;t. Not yet. Not until I trust you first.
So, you think those things down the steps there are dangerous? The ones hanging on the sticks?
Cave Entrance
*Laugh it off; every day&apos;s an adventure!*
*Try to get the spirit&apos;s attention.*
Hrrmh, alight then. Now leave me be, dwarf - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
Siphon Poison Scroll
Natalie&apos;s her name, by the way. I&apos;ve told her all about what you did for her. She&apos;ll be able to go home soon, as long as she steers clear of the Magisters.
Don&apos;t want food. Don&apos;t want shelter. I just wanna escape this gods-damned place for a few minutes.
Sanguinia Tell gave us a loan. For collateral she took a vial of our marrow.
You are welcome to stay and walk with me, should you wish it. Though... my vigil honours Rhalic, who bears no tenderness towards your kind.
Statue of Burning Prophet
Not in the mood for games? Me neither. So what shall we do? Would you like me to dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
Winnin&apos; has its own rewards, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after. Slip down the hatch and talk to Thorn. Put those greasy hands of yours to work.
Unfh! They got me good.
He was &lt;i&gt;Black Ring?&lt;/i&gt;
*Silently pray for a reprieve.*
*Hold the gem to the six-sided shape carved in the figure&apos;s forehead.*
Gods... h-have mercy...
Apportation
Be aware that the ones who travel with you are not your friends. They are your &lt;i&gt;rivals&lt;/i&gt;.
[BARBARIAN] *You are a brute, a beast, a creature of folklore. Confirm his story.*
On their way to the Lady Vengeance for further study.  Dallis was right about what we uncovered here - it could turn the tide against the Voidwoken.
Ain&apos;t a bad poem. If yer into humans, I guess.
They have me over a barrel, they do. I don&apos;t have a choice. It&apos;s hard enough to earn a crust around here, and me and the young one, we&apos;ve been starving.
An explosive filled with nails that do [1] and may inflict bleeding to everyone in a [2] radius. Creates a small water surface with a [3] radius.
Always business to take care of around here.
Water Barrel
Valve Half Open
You&apos;re... you&apos;re the Godwoken, right? This place is... scary.
M... mumsy? Is she herrre? Mumsy! Wherrre arrre you! &apos;tis I, Booply Bear! I am quite changed, but don&apos;t be frrrightened!
*The tallest, strongest elf, whom you take to be the leader, gives you a disapproving look, then turns away.*
Proceed carefully, then. A shadow comes...
*Well, now that he mentions it, a little shape-shifting might be fun...*
*Wait! Tell her you&apos;ve important information that her master will want to know.*
Y&apos;want some honey? &lt;i&gt;Y&apos;can&apos;t have&apos;t..&lt;/i&gt;
I feel like I could eat a whole bloody cow. I... I don&apos;t feel like myself...
This creature is born of fire - eat it, and you might gain some of its power.
Tir-Cendelius
*Encourage him to continue.*
Signpost
You&apos;re safe! Praise the Divine!
You can have anything you find in this house, but there ain&apos;t no money. Do we look rich to you?
*Nod. You enjoyed yourself well enough.*
Now that that&apos;s done, I ask you in earnest: are you truly alright? I can only imagine how you must feel now that you&apos;ve slain the prey you hunted for years.
Splendid.
*The weather-beaten war owl salutes you with one wing. Looking closer, you can see a telltale scratch on her left claw. This is the war owl who delivered your message from the Paladin Camp!*
Gotta hand it to &apos;em. Elves sure smell better than us when they die. Kinda like fall leaves, y&apos;know?
*Your eye is drawn to a large rune resembling an illustration you&apos;ve seen in a book.*
[RED PRINCE] *If he thinks he can be useful, say that you&apos;ll welcome his efforts.*
PAPA?! PAAAAPaaaaaaaaa...
*Ask why she&apos;s accepted so many people into this shrine.*
Let them speak. We owe them that much.
I don&apos;t know what rock he is hiding under, but he will be found.
Move along - nothing to see here.
This isn&apos;t the place to wave your weapons around like that.
An odd, crystalline (and, apparently, sentient) object pulsating with eldritch energy.
...my ring!
Pride was lost as humankind progressed...
Player [1]
What do you get the pyromaniac who has everything?
And after all, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am still here. Despite the Voidwoken&apos;s best efforts...
*Tell her she needn&apos;t go on. You shouldn&apos;t have brought it up in the first place.*
We make a pretty good team...
It&apos;s a miracle of the ancients. Priceless, really, and powerful enough to draw the Magisters&apos; attentions.
You also have some small reward.
Baran Levere&apos;s Ring Of Bartering
[1] was reflected to [2] by a summon.
*In that heat is a memory. A dwarf yearning to dig, unable to stop.*
*Pull the skeletal arm from your bag. Is this his?*
No...! Not yet... not yet! We aren&apos;t... we can&apos;t...!
A jewel with strange markings etched onto each facet. It would no doubt fetch a high price... but perhaps it has another purpose?
How beautiful a thing for me to see before -
But me? I love a good story.
We&apos;ve got enough wood for this fire, thanks. Move along.
New Level
These marshes were a playground for he and his necromancers. Many unfortunate souls were brought here. Blessed were those who died quickly. Or died at all...
