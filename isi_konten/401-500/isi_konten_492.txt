It&apos;s a good contract. Why else? Cut down a couple of know-nothings, and the gold pours in like rain. Been running since the Great War, too. Each of your kind gets me a hefty sum.
Raised as a zombie until status expires or character is resurrected.
*The spirit of a White Magister tips a vial of powder into a goblet of wine before her. She swallows it back without hesitation.*
The greatest weapon Rivellon has ever seen lands in his lap and he ordered the barrels thrown into the ocean!
If you wanted my attention, you could&apos;ve just said &apos;hi&apos;.
I never would have thought it myself either, but he resurfaced and won over us veterans - Magister and Paladin alike. Now he&apos;s set upon becoming Divine, just like his father.
Alexandar&apos;s survival didn&apos;t last long.
Excellent! It may well be within your grasp.
*Reply with &apos;The House of Trade&apos;.*
I&apos;m not at liberty to discuss that. Ma&apos;am.
He... he&apos;ll be back, Samadel. I &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;he will. He &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to.
In the meantime, have a little token as a thank you for all that you&apos;ve done for me so far.
*Chuckle that you would like a better sense of humour...*
*Place yourself between the spirit and whatever seems to be looming in front of her.*
Venom-Wing Voidwoken
*He staggers back to his feet, and walks backwards, eyes trained on you the whole time.*
Nemesis Soulhunter
*Change the subject.*
I am in &lt;i&gt;intense &lt;/i&gt;pain, kin. You are either insufferably cruel or insufferably stupid.
*His clenched jaw tightens further. And then, in an instant, Gareth&apos;s guard is broken. Tears well in his eyes. With every blink, a pearl of grief falls to his cheeks.*
Death Breath
Still, I won&apos;t pretend I&apos;m not grateful. I couldn&apos;t have done it without you.
*Ask if she ever felt a connection between the two of you.*
*Shrug and say you don&apos;t think anyone had much choice in the matter.*
You&apos;re... gods, you&apos;re so terribly kind. But I couldn&apos;t accept such lavish charity. I just... it&apos;s so unbecoming.
I suppose you want to cross?
*The elven warrior stands guard over a captive Magister. The Magister looks a little worse for wear.*
...where did you hear that, precisely? Never mind... the Aeteran is a children&apos;s fable, nothing more. Supposedly a wand with an infinite capacity for Source. Pure nonsense, I assure you.
*Extend your arm in a welcoming gesture. She&apos;s free to speak first.*
*Offer to put him out his misery. It&apos;s the best you can do.*
Crowned Pig
*Do as he asks.*
He has my eyes.
*Tell the child she smells worse.*
*Tell him you&apos;ll go look. He&apos;d better not be lying.*
Oh don&apos;t worry, I daresay there&apos;s still plenty of danger ahead.
The Devourer doomed us! And the Empress reveled in cruelty.
Trekking Boots
*She sets an empty bottle on the ground between you and looks at you impishly.*
Sturdy and solid, this crossbow was made to the blueprints of Lucian&apos;s own ranged infantry.
Don&apos;t waste your time here - the secrets of this place are protected by some of the finest ciphers ever created.
We read of the &apos;Artefacts of the Tyrant&apos;. A powerful suit of armour, it must be equipped in its entirety, lest the wearer be cursed.
*Say you don&apos;t quite understand.*
It&apos;s very pretty.
Please, hurry! It&apos;s stifling in here!

This chestpiece, grown from a poisonous spore, is lined with tiny, bloodstained roots. It won&apos;t be easy to remove.
*You do your best to remain inconspicuous, observing the scene from behind some barrels and crates stacked near the water&apos;s edge.*
If it wasn&apos;t for me, the armour wouldn&apos;t exist at all! This... oh, this is my fault.
Sick
*The troll stares at you in abject confusion for a long moment, before - *
*Tell Exter the Seekers should move forward in spite of the Shriekers.*

She&apos;s badly afflicted, but still powerful. Be careful.
You have a reputation for both malfeasance and chaos. Imagine my surprise when it took you so long to find your way here. I see the miasma surrounding our islet certainly did not hinder you.

I know. Or did you think I chose you for your beard alone?
*Reach for your weapon. You will finish this here and now.*
*Continue to listen.*
I suppose that puppy-eager expression of yours could be read as sincerity. Very well then.
There you have it.
The cook&apos;s been reported dead... I thought she was another victim, but if she had &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;... she must have been the culprit, there&apos;s no other explanation!
Everyone is so mean. Someone was hurt! It wasn&apos;t you, was it?
Saheila herself led the elves out of Rivellon.
*Ask what exactly Dallis had him do here.*
[LOHSE] *Without a word, in absolute privacy, let her know you too have much to weep about.*
*Shrug and take your leave.*
&lt;i&gt;Fear?&lt;/i&gt; Please, why would I fear these creatures?
We may have found Tarquin&apos;s artefact in the Surrey family crypt.
One of us accepted the Doctor&apos;s pact.

I did survive, yes. And chances are I wouldn&apos;t have, had you not returned to the aid of your fellow passengers down in that dreadful hold.
Don&apos;t you fight me, Damian! I&apos;m Lucian an&apos; I&apos;ll kill you!
*Say that you know who&apos;s responsible for the disappearences in town.*
Thank you, ma&apos;am. I just wish I could&apos;ve had a crack at Dallis.
*Repeat the phrase: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;

You&apos;re... you&apos;re a monster!
*He takes one last look around...*
*She gestures at the bound Magister - and freezes, as if listening.*
What&apos;s the difference? They fight their cosmic wars and we suffer. We should go it alone.

Sorry, but it ain&apos;t happenin&apos;. Ain&apos;t got a whiff of the One about ya.
You can&apos;t buy yourself out of this situation!
*The woman sees you approach - her mournful expression curdles into a venomous stare.*

My thanks. I pray we can end this quickly.

Gaze into the gem, my lovely.
The Blackpits took fire. The oil there burns still.

Braccus Rex the just can give you what you want and more. But who are you, the living, to hope to solve the riddles of Braccus Rex the just? Who are you to open the doors?

*Lohse sways to the left and claps twice, as though clearing the air. Her eyes flutter shut, lips set in a serene smile, and she starts moving to an inaudible rhythm.*
And - perhaps not. This is the chance I take.
The sweetest scents flourish in the deepest tombs. Tell me. Do you like roses?

*The Voidwoken claims that the Eternals can return to this world. That Fane can be home again. The skeleton looks back at you.*
Probably best to just carry on as usual. Ignore the blood, and the smell of burning Magister. Things will settle... I hope.
A thief&apos;s prowling about, I&apos;m afraid. Let me see all of your belongings.
E... eggwoken. Voidwokegg. Gone, gone, gone.

This booklet contains detailed instructions on how to throw and when to release the Holy Hand Grenade. There&apos;s even exercises that you can fill in, and very complicated rules explaining how to organise a role-playing game for practicing the actual throw. Finally, on the last page, there is the simple recipe on how to make one: &apos;Find the rare Holy Hand Grenade Orb, open it and fill it up with a starfish. Then close it. Or buy one in a shop.&apos;
