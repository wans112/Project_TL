You know, I think I&apos;ve heard of you. The assassin with the needle... Maybe I needn&apos;t be such a stickler for slave laws after all. Yes, I&apos;d much rather have you for an ally, not an adversary.
Holy, holy, holy... You oughta thank your lucky stars that thing hasn&apos;t turned you into a meat puppet by now.

*Tell her you met the same woman. She kissed you too.*
Much Eternal technology remains on the island. It feels familiar, and yet alien. I may be spending too much time with mortals.
Somehow, you recognise the words etched upon the tablet, though you can&apos;t identify the language.
Bloody Iron Key
We are free of the ancestor trees, kin. But it is said that there shall be a new Mother. I pray she is both strong and kind.

*Try &apos;open&apos;.*
Easy, eh?
Welcome to the Joy, my famed friend.
and the willingness of its denizens to stab each other in the back for the slightest advantage.
It was good to see some of them bleed after what they did to the ship.
[RED PRINCE] *You&apos;d be having orgies and winning wars. The usual.*
Now... you can play nice and we&apos;ll see about that discount, or you can play nasty and say farewell to your existence. Which is it to be?
This power is my birthright, same as yours! But one of us has grown to astounding heights, and the other has sunken to depths too humiliating to describe. Pity.

*Say that you just wanted a closer look.*
Dog
Unknown item
I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;hope you learned something useful on our little field trip.
*Ask what happened to the boy.*
*She turns to you, arms crossed, and grins.*
Pearl
How &lt;i&gt;marvellous!&lt;/i&gt;
Wishin&apos; you a better day than mine.
[LIZARD] *Remind her the ancestral goddess of lizards is Zorl-Stissa, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Amadia.*
Dead Commoner
Rhalic. A swindler and a brute.
*Tell him you were happy to aid him. No-one should remain falsely imprisoned.*
*When she looks up at you again the pink tint has cleared completely from her eyes.*
*Defend the queen, in spite of it all. This is not the young woman you once knew.*
Bloody rats.
The Master... Ha! Even he is but a mortal. His spells hold no sway over me! He cannot scar my bare cheekbone, but I can scar &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Scar you &lt;i&gt;all over&lt;/i&gt;...
I know someone on the outside. She might be able to help you too... if we make it out of here.
Cowaaaaaaaard!
Lohse?! By my boots, it&apos;s an honour to meet you!
*Tell her there are people you care for all around you. You can&apos;t leave them behind.*
*Insist that you didn&apos;t say anything! You were just minding your own business, and then... this.*
*Note that you are travelling with a lizard loyal to the Empire. She can trust you.*
We left the undead necromancers trapped forever.
*Admit that you have sinned.*
*Your eyes close. Death&apos;s shadows lift; rain becomes sun. Whatever fear this graveyard provoked is now bathed in brilliant light.*
*Say you don&apos;t want anything from him. You just needed some company.*
Are you sure you want to discard your changes?
Please... please don&apos;t leave me down here!
Hurt? Dear me, no. All I felt was pride. My Featherfall knew just how to slice and just what to chew.
Beast&apos;s loyalty to his people remains. I shall concede Divinity to him.
My... eye you will! I&apos;ll - I&apos;ll - !
*She looks around, checking for prying ears, and lowers her voice.*
Now of divinity, let me give you a taste.
The only thing that springs eternal is blood from gushing wounds.
[LOHSE] *Hesitate. Tell the dog he can&apos;t give up. Not yet.*
Moving to corporeal transposition engine!

To think, that lunatic Siva is loose again. We won&apos;t be so gentle when he catch her this time...
Watch your back, new fish. There&apos;s a murderer on board, and I&apos;d bet three months pay it&apos;s this tramp Ifan.
*Beg his pardon.*
Didn&apos;t hear me the first time, eh? That&apos;ll be a hard &lt;i&gt;&apos;no&apos;,&lt;/i&gt; dear.
*Sniffle...*
Leave me be, demon!

By the by, a black little birdie told me you&apos;ve a ship along the shore. That is where we&apos;ll go. Enjoy a bit of sun while we wait...
*Ask the elf about what comes next. How do you ascend to Divinity?*
Kemm claimed that Arhu was a regular guest, his visit unremarkable. Do we believe him?
Projectiles targeted at or near this character are sent back where they came from. On expiration, changes to Phase A Volatility, which reduces damage of nearby enemies.
Ah - a little reprieve from the din outside.
So, we have a new Divine?
*Ask what he means by that.*
My goodness. It was certainly an experience, but I must admit I was expecting something... more.
*Laugh heartily, and tell him that drink never gets the better of you - it is you that gets the better of drink!*
I wish it every night. More than anything.
*Ask her what happened - why the rough landing?*
Lohse... it&apos;s good to see your face. We lost too many friends, taking this ship.
Worst part of the job, this.
Undead! Strike it down!

Magical Big Warhammer
Well. I&apos;ve no doubt you&apos;ll get to it when you can...
[SEBILLE] *Say you don&apos;t answer to him or anyone else.*
Why, my dear Ifan, you already &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; the finest safeguard possible for traversing this place - a mercenary&apos;s reputation.
Undead Lizard Warrior
Bastard.
Spirit of Magister Knight
*Darkness descends, and quickly you are blind. Your other senses rise, and you hear and feel and &lt;i&gt;smell &lt;/i&gt;the world. You are not lost. You shall never be lost again.*
You take the first step towards godhood. The cost of all Source skills is modified by [1] Source Point(s). All primary attributes increased by [2].
With that mask I can shapeshift and walk through this world looking like any other simple mortal. I could look like a lizard, a dwarf, a human - any creature whose face I can procure.
*Tut and say he&apos;s being quite impolite speaking of the Divine like that; the Avatar of the Seven.*
*Say you met in Driftwood, but she disappeared before you had a chance to talk.*
He arrived in Driftwood some days ago, dressed as a tinkerer. He bought and sold a few knick-knacks, but we thought nothing of it until our brothers started vanishing.
*With the piece of your mind that is still your own, urge the spirit to run.*
You should have just confessed, spy... I might have given you a quick death then. Guards! Seize this one - she shall buuurn!
Remember how when we first met I licked your arm?
Blessed Smoke Cloud
*The dwarf bounces up and down with glee, then catches himself and clears his throat. He bows before you.*

*Say you want to help; ask her what you must do.*
You&apos;ll pay for that.
*She hands you a small yet heavy trinket crafted of tarnished metal. Though cold, it feels comforting to the touch, like a worry stone or a familiar childhood toy.*
Fane and I went below decks together, but I left before things got too intense.
A cool wind blows from the Spring Realm of Vernivia directly into this feather-light, enchanted orb.
By all means let us part - if you can part these bars that block us first.
*Ask what she has in mind.*
You deserve to know the truth.
*Laugh. She&apos;s making this up, isn&apos;t she?*
I pray the Seven guide Gwydian to safety.
...you! Glad to see you made it.
In my time I sculpted many elegant traps. My work with light was unparalleled. Such a precious material - capable of rendering something invisible or rendering it vapour.
You don&apos;t?
A healthy specimen fresh-caught from the seas around Fort Joy.
Forgotten? But that wouldn&apos;t do at all. I remember every dream &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; were in.
*As your vision fades to black, you see the walls shudder as the Peacemaker snaps in two.*
Large Frost Rune Of Power
*The spirit tries to struggle against your will, but the tendrils of your Source wrap around him, draining him of his essence. Soon there&apos;s nothing left but a gentle scream in the air.*
You&apos;re right about that. Right as rain, Hilga.
*She winces and clutches her belly, but slaps you hard on the shoulder with her other hand.*
We left the island without finding all of the &apos;Artefacts of the Tyrant&apos;.
*Explain that you&apos;re hunting down the groom. Does she have any idea where he might be?*
*You try to look out of your eyes; you see nothing.*
*The spirit offers you a friendly look, but does not speak to you.*
*Lohse&apos;s face goes suddenly pale and grey. She darts over to the young elf and they begin talking in earnest, more quietly than you can overhear.*
I don&apos;t think so, not for such a meager sum.
This place reeks of death.
*She removes the needle and draws her weapon.*
I wonder. How to extract the Source from the vessel without- *gasp*
No... why did this happen...?
Magic Armour Points
Now where shall I put this one...
There was no Legion in the slums of Yuthul Gor. There was no mayor, no magistrate, no law. Only the Fighter. If your horse had been stolen, the Fighter would find it. If your landlord extorted you, the Fighter would help him see reason. This justice was harsh but effective; order persisted.  When the king heard of the vigilante who dared enforce the law without the monarch&apos;s consent, he was outraged. &quot;Banish this traitor,&quot; the king said. But the king&apos;s guards could not subdue the warrior, no matter their swords and spears.  At last, the king called upon a black witch to cast a spell upon the so-called usurper. As the Fighter slept, terrible nightmares invaded where soldiers could not. Mad with terror, the Fighter fled and wandered for weeks before the nightmares began to subside. But if the Fighter dared wander in the direction of home, the nightmares began afresh.  The king might be untouchable, but dark magic was not. As a Source Hunter, the Fighter would destroy the charm at its root. Then would come the king&apos;s turn.
But it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, don&apos;t you see? It&apos;s the concern of the entire world.

The hand-bindings of the Knight of Amadia are ancient and faded in colour yet they still flicker and twitch with innate Source.

You know what affects me a great deal? Hauling you thither and yon only to see you still haven&apos;t managed to ascend. I want a god in my debt. Is that so much to ask?

*He must have seen a battle. Ask him more about it.*
It might be that you&apos;re right. We&apos;ve turned this place upside down, and still there&apos;s no sign. Very well then, I&apos;ll call off the search.
