T-t-t-t-to end my days &lt;i&gt;here &lt;/i&gt;where I once toiled... but oh how I p-p-p-p-prayed for an end... &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; the end...
Hands to yourself! I do not forgive you easily.
Unarmed
What say you? Have we time to spare?
A day like today and you&apos;re shopping? You people.
I can&apos;t hear nothing. Nothing but that voice. It won&apos;t stop. It never stops...
What an odd creature...

*With a dip of her head she indicates that you should talk to her companion... then she turns back to her drink.*
*Change the subject.*
Move FreeCamera Forward
Poor, poor fool...
Here now! When one&apos;s in a small town, one must expect small town manners, I see.
He should be left to suffer. Leave him in the dark to mull over his own belly button.
Hah. Never mind. I mistook you for someone else.
Bah. I&apos;ve had enough of your yowling. Get along, then.

[VILLAIN] *Tap your hollow head and say you&apos;ve changed your mind. Breaking a jar is less amusing than leaving a soul in torment...*
*Tell the Djinn he&apos;s lucky, the lamp protected him from the horrors the Gods unleashed on the world.*
Hope you can help us out, brother. I ain&apos;t ashamed to admit we need it.
Ha! No. In this, there can be no compromise.
*Say you still aren&apos;t convinced you&apos;re the person for the job.*
A new Divine rose, a true heir to the Seven,
*The man rolls his sleeves back down. He nods at you, the shadow of a smile on his lips.*
*Tell her she must answer for her crime: &apos;Operation Downfall&apos;.*
But these questions won&apos;t let me rest. To be a loyal soldier for so long, then... then treated like that.
No, no, no. What a stupid mistake you make. Think on that in your prison cell!
Yes... yes, I think so too. The story belongs to us both... and by now the Shield deserves to know the truth.
*Ask if the esteemed Cranley Huwbert was sufficiently impressed by what you told him.*
In a black mirror, I saw the Red Princess. She&apos;s in Arx!
Blademaster Guardian
*Tap Leya on the shoulder and ask if she can help you remove your Source collar.*
Fine Coif
...from death comes life...
[SCHOLAR] *Examine the blue lever - it seems to open the expulsion hatch. Use it.*
A book praising the military prowess of dwarves.
*Shake your head and take your leave.*
It is pleasurable to meet you.
*The thought occurs - the Scion replaced one bad deal with another.*
You are a beautiful specimen. I forget my manners...
*Tell her you&apos;ll see what you can do.*
The Path of the Soul
At least... that&apos;s what I thought then. I believed in the cause of the Great Acorn. I believed the Knights of Drey were righteous in their quest.
She is a goddess and I am her servant: a hand and shield maiden of Amadia, praise be her name and praise be her starlit eyes.
The War Room
A path has revealed itself! Looks like I just found a way out.
Pretty hot, right?
Talk to the boss, if you &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;talk.
You&apos;re very lucky I&apos;m helping them get you to where you&apos;re going, Godwoken.
UI Select Slot5
Alright. I&apos;ll go outside, but I won&apos;t go unarmed. And I&apos;ll take &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;weapon too, if it&apos;s available. What do you say, can I count on your help?
*Hide your arm behind your back. Why do you feel like a child, caught doing something forbidden?*
Acidic Explosion

*Assure him you know how to handle the damned House of Shadows.*
Charming Arrow
You&apos;re on thin ice, lady. And I&apos;m very close to cracking.

*Remember what Captain Orell said. Ask him if he knows where Dallis might be.*
C-c-c-CAT! Eeeek!
Before I leave you... I have something for you. Something I learned. A touch of Void, if you will.
You look almost exactly like every other elf out there, just as every human looks like every other human.
*Say there&apos;s something else you&apos;d like to discuss.*
*Grunt and tell him that you haven&apos;t seen any tinkerers.*
Ball-ball-ball-ball-ball-ball-ball-ball-ball.
Power of Innocence Orchestral
Can&apos;t join Arena game in progress!
[RED PRINCE] *Soothe her. She can be at peace now. She can go home.*
*She gives you a smile of the purest hate. Then she raises a hand and begins a silent incantation. You know that she is trying to boil your blood... but she cannot - her power is gone.*
This collar is choking the life from me; perhaps there&apos;s a solution inside.
Gaze Of Doom
Go to the Nameless Isle
Be ready to flee, if necessary.
*Let him continue. You want to see what happens next.*
Can only be cast outside of combat.
*The Doctor turns to Ifan after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*
That makes you a liability. That makes you needle feed.
Oh, but you must stay. You wouldn&apos;t be so rude to your hostess, would you?
In the bowels of Fort Joy we met a deranged Magister conducting horrible experiments on purged Sourcerers.
*Wonder how he ended up on the ship to Fort Joy.*
Junk...
The thing inside her is voracious. It&apos;s a testament to her strength that it hasn&apos;t long since consumed her whole.
Bishop Alexandar. The smug little tyke that thinks he can imprison a prince. How comical.
Still can&apos;t believe the Magisters were in cahoots with the Black Ring.
It looks like I was right to stop you!
Between haves and have-nots alike, dwarves are fiercely nationalistic. Even the poorest dwarf would die for their dwindling Kingdom. But not all would die for the Queen...
*The dragon whelp eyes you playfully, then unleashes a torrent of fire. You&apos;ve barely the dexterity to jump out of its way.*
Now, l-e-e-e-t&apos;s see...
The Four Relics of Rivellon
A spice beloved all across Rivellon for its power to transform even the blandest fare into a tasty treat. Some say its the only seasoning sprinkled by the elves to make the more mature meats they imbibe palatable.
Medium Intelligence Potion
*Seek his memories of Paradise Downs.*
Serrated Twohander
Goodness - how could I not? Her work on Blackpeak Isle is legendary, or so she told it, at least. The King has an eye for the arrogant; they make such valuable stewards as they clamour for his favour, as I well know.
*He smacks your hand away, refusing the potion.*
The Red Prince found a dead lizard. If this was a dreamer, she dreams no more.
*Ask what she means - what sort of matches are held here?*
*The dwarf shivers and wraps her arms around herself with a loud &apos;brrrr.&apos;*
Nothing. There&apos;s got to be more to it.
Blinding Radiance Scroll
I... I don&apos;t want no trouble, lizard... j-just leave me alone...
You must allow this. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;important.&lt;/i&gt;
Qanna
&lt;b&gt;Fool! She is ours. Any strength is OURS.&lt;/b&gt;
Good luck. You&apos;re going to need it.
Sure, why not? Not all of &apos;em hatch, you know. And between you and me, honey, I don&apos;t mind the taste of an omelette now and again.
*For a moment you think the Sallow Man may be smiling, then you understand; this is a deal you cannot decline. &lt;i&gt;Take the deal if you want to walk out of here alive.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Sadha appears in the wagon&apos;s door, her eyes wide with fright.*
Yes, &lt;i&gt;missing&lt;/i&gt;. I know you thought you&apos;d had your fun with the Boy Bishop, but you didn&apos;t finish the job. He escaped in the mayhem - I saw it with my own eyes.
What do I do now...? What do I do...
So. Now we must part, with fire in your soul and resolve in your mind.
Their tale is one of scholars becoming gods. If they &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt;, we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;. Which is rather excellent.
- um, that is to say, there is nowhere I would rather be than by your side.
*Squint your eyes. He doesn&apos;t talk like any philosopher you&apos;ve ever known...*
*Gazing towards some far-off sight you cannot see, the spirit of the dwarf glimmers, fades into nothingness, and is gone.*
*The cat begins to purr and rub itself on your ankles.*
*As the voice fades from your ears, a sigil appears in the air above you: a flaming arrowhead.*
... Quite.
Defeat...
*Ask if it can wait.*
Void Fiend
Herbs
Wait - wait! Care for him. If you can. If you can help me. He&apos;s my responsibility. I failed him. &lt;i&gt;I failed him!&lt;/i&gt;
she restored them to life.
*Ask him how he knows that.*
The Devourer&apos;s Maw
*She shuffles her enormous body closer, looming over you until you are enveloped under her shadow. Venom sizzles to the sand from her fangs as you are pinned in place under all eight of her eyeballs.*
Doomsday Device
*Alexandar holds his hands outwards towards Gareth, his blade resting flat across his palms - a gesture of goodwill and peace.*
*The Magister recoils, pulling against you. You try to keep hold but succeed only in driving it further into his chest with a wet crunch. He sags, eyes wild with pain.*
To all the dwellers of Rivellon, Noble and Common alike,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let it be known that the once-planned nuptials between Her Most Royal Highness Princess Zenthia of the Fire Lands and the fallen despot Braccus Rex have been annulled, and are to be stricken from all public records.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Her Royal Highness wishes it to be known that she is willing to consider courtship overtures from gentlemen of note and wealth who are befitting her royal status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All hail Princess Zenthia!
Truly? Good heavens, you hide it well. I&apos;m not sure your people really &lt;i&gt;look &lt;/i&gt;at things like animals any more.

You may go on ahead, if you prefer.
&lt;b&gt;Good, take your time. Prolong her torment.&lt;/b&gt;
Ring of the Pilgrim
Leave me... alone!
*Wary all of a sudden, she takes a step back from you.*
Ugly Sandals
Yes, but... just another little while.
*Say they haven&apos;t been very helpful.*
*Tell him elves are quite nice, too. And they don&apos;t eat pets.*
You poor child. There you are.
Imagine what would happen if I win? I&apos;d be god that can be controlled by a man with a song!
I suppose it will. Never hurts to shake things up a bit. Spice of life, and all that.
*Say you&apos;re sorry. You couldn&apos;t save her.*
*Say that you want to hear what this &apos;trial&apos; entails first.*
*Shrug. It&apos;s not like you meant to come here...*
*Take her hand.*
Blackroot
Tell them the truth about Joe. They have to grow up some time.
FXAA
From the rank and file to the top brass, they&apos;re as ruthless as the wildest Lone Wolf. But the difference? A wolf never tries to hide what he truly is.
[OUTLAW] *Wonder if she&apos;s thankful enough to throw a little reward your way.*
Master Tremly
I&apos;ve never &lt;i&gt;felt &lt;/i&gt;better.
*Tell him he&apos;s the best part of the journey.*
Calamity
And now for the rest!
Magister Houndmaster
Neat - I&apos;ve always wanted to explore a haunted house!
Weight
Oh, the usual drill. Pins and hooks and matches and all that. Most of the Godwoken are dead. We&apos;ve got to find out who&apos;s been hunting them, haven&apos;t we? My money&apos;s on the godspawn.
What do you th-think?
*Play along and say you always keep a spare.*
Wolf Die
Kemm is dead.
A grenade so terrific, it can scare off enemies in a [1] radius.
I proclaim thee the Champion of the Driftwood arena! Get yer gloat on, &apos;n&apos; take a swig of ale. Hell, take a dozen. We&apos;ll be singin&apos; for years to come of the great dwarven Void-slayer!
