*Stare at him blankly. He was looking for you to be his what now?*
*Another smile, and another cup poured.*
Big Piece Of Wood
But don&apos;t worry, I have studied the arcane arts for years, including necromancy and demonology. I do not hold the petty prejudices of common folks. In fact I prefer the exceptional in all things. Your secret is safe with me.
Potion of Vitality
Sister! Do not stay here. You must run. RUN!
I remember hearing screams, feeling the blood of others on my hands, in my mouth... then I ran.
*Sebille walks up to you and frowns.*
Do me a favour: Get out of here, and hie ye to the north of Driftwood. My old master was hot on the heels of something there, and if anyone can help you, he can.
*Say you&apos;ve heard tell of some kind of &apos;thieves&apos; guild&apos;. What does he know?*
My, my, Ifan! How you positively brim with Source. No wonder, after all the adventures you have had; all the things you&apos;ve had to do...
Poison Potion
*Tell him you&apos;d rather spill secrets and blood.*
Yes. More than enough room for your name...
Lesser Fire Ooze
Well, how do you think? I have a mouth, don&apos;t I?
*She twirls her needle nonchalantly between her fingers, but fumbles it and pricks her thumb. She pockets the needle and sucks away the little bead of blood that appears over the tiny wound.*
That of the Outlaw Empress and her misguided quest to claim the Devourer&apos;s power.
Hush, little one, hush now...
Dwarven Twohander
*He hurls the warhammer away with a final yell, before turning to you with a deep scowl, panting for breath that he no longer needs.*
Muh... muh... mother...? Is that you...? I had a bad dream...
*Slowly draw your needle. Say the needle doesn&apos;t like stupid questions.*
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry for his loss.*
I have known life and death and the wasteland in between. Do you really think you can intimidate &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt;
Here, missus! Alexandar doesn&apos;t have to stay dead, does - HEY! Are you a &lt;i&gt;lizard?&lt;/i&gt;
I... believe we are done here.
*She frowns and passes her tongue over her teeth once more, concentrating.*
The next Magister I meet is going to suffer.
Known as a &apos;Finnor Feather&apos; for the fletched and arrow-like shape of the head, this mace is commonly used as a ceremonial weapon by the nobility of Finnor.
Well! That&apos;s your right, isn&apos;t it. If you&apos;ll excuse me then, I have quite enough of my own to attend to.
Tell me, &lt;i&gt;Sammy Smartypants&lt;/i&gt;: is there such thing as free will?
I am your love of death... come embrace your cousin... come repay your debts... COME AND FACE THE END...
*Ask if he thinks you look like a Sourcerer.*
How did they get past the guards?
Aye, and nothin&apos; all-but-worthless, either!
There is only one fool among us - and it is not me!
Its seas, however, were mine. And will be, once more.
*Demand the voice gets out of your head.*
You desired strength, and so my venom gives it you.
And they ain&apos;t the only ones. Some places need rebuilt. Others... others need destroyed.
Down you go. But no shenanigans, mind. I hear of any more &lt;i&gt;incidents &lt;/i&gt;down there? I&apos;ll shave your damn wolf bald myself...
Seeing Spirits
There are no statuses on this character
*He pauses, then nods his thanks to you before turning and following a path into the unknown.*
Yet my failure was... absolute. I am not fit to bear the insignia of the Source Hunters any longer.
Oh! Well I beg your pardon and tip me stolen hat, but you can see I was meanin&apos; no harm. Jus&apos; nice to see a face that brings me real joy in the Joy.
That&apos;ll teach you to make assumptions then, won&apos;t it?
Crucifix
*He may have lost his people, but at least he&apos;s found his daughter?*
You speak my language! My lips are sealed on the matter.
House of the Lost God
Purging Device
Nothing good will come of speaking with them. They may sound merely mad, but they&apos;re infinitely more clever than you imagine. They move between moods like wind through trees only to settle upon the one that may just sway you.
Sebille...

Unfortunate. We&apos;re finished here.
This used to be a nice neighbourhood, you know.
I&apos;m so glad my Peeper is... WAIT! WHERE IS IT?! BABY?! BABY!
A very large-sized, bright-smelling, spicy elixir capable of protecting you against pyrokinetic attacks.
Report back to Marg.
*Tell him to stand down, &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;the God King&apos;s Godwoken, &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;give the orders.*
Enter at your leisure.
*Tell the dog you ate a bad bit of liver. That&apos;s what it&apos;s smelling.*
I am travelling, yes: to Arx. Lucian&apos;s Day will be upon us soon: a celebration no man with a heart that is both as pious and mercantile as mine should miss.
A Letter from Isbeil&apos;s Laboratory
Dwarves. Of course he turned to the dwarves. Sneaking little runts - Magister Carver will hear of this!
I&apos;m sure the bards will sing of your heroics for generations!
*Mumbles...* I am the last of my hide, my stripe, my streak. All of us but I fell dead in the mist when the two-legs had their war. I pray to thee, to bring us back, to save us from our end.
Posh Amulet
We destroyed the Shriekers barring our way.
I was almost free of this hell. Almost...
I ascended. I am Divine. May I be better than the last.
Perhaps we simply ought to hug the coast in search of a ship.
Not my proudest moment, I admit.
We&apos;re barely acquainted - why should I tell you anything personal?
And I heard rumours... he had a wand that could purge the Source from whoever he so chose. He could collect the Source and use it himself. Can you imagine it? Being so very &lt;i&gt;swollen &lt;/i&gt;with the power of a myriad of lost souls?
There&apos;s nothing to be done. Let&apos;s keep moving.

And when the war is won, &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;count the losses. &lt;i&gt;Elves&lt;/i&gt; count the losses. And so we fight, that we may count our victories too. We fight and win, or lose and die.
Shields Up
*The voice finishes with an aside - the elves will rise and follow &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; When you are all-powerful. When you are &lt;i&gt;Divine.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Squints.* Elodi... Oldwood? Impaler...
The Wicked
*Laden with the burden of the coin you gave them, the Brothers of Baladur sink back to the bottom of the well. Whether they will find their kingdom or languish in the dark, wet depths forever, you cannot foretell.*
[SCHOLAR] *Stay silent; in the right hands, this artefact may reveal more about the mechanics of purging.*
There are stories in our lore of elves who disobey the Mother Tree. The mother usually wins.
Blackroot has been added to the ritual bowl.
When we first met, I thought that maybe...
*Ask her why she was faking that whole sob story.*
We need to get to Dallis. We must find out how to get into Lucian&apos;s tomb, and do it fast.
The God King had defeated the Seven and returned from the Void.
*A lifeless elven child is cradled in your arms. Your vision blurs with tears - you look away...*

...Not that it matters. No one else will even listen.
*Ask your lizard lover if it&apos;s true - did he know this would happen all along?*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without meeting Roost.

Still, you have the look of a criminal. Say something for yourself!
*Say yes. You love her too.*
I mean - this &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;what&apos;s right. Of course it is. My people suffered too long - they can finally live again.
And much as I&apos;d like to blame your scaled hide, you&apos;ve only just arrived. Now tell me, have you seen a man in a grey cloak? Grey beard? Carrying a satchel, perhaps?
I will fix a terrible mistake. Not that it matters to you. You won&apos;t be here to see it.
*Burp!* Woops. The thing inside does &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;like the sound of that.
They should call him Alexandar the Misguided.
Let&apos;s rest up. Whatever comes next, I want to be ready for it.
Abandoned Temple
*Leave the spirit to her guilt.*
Divine blessings, it&apos;s good to see Gareth safe and sound.

New Human Female Player
Good to see you, Bishop. Now I know who oughta answer for this collar.
You are a fitting one to attempt ascension, Godwoken. I am proud to have met you.
[RED PRINCE] *Sarcastically declare they forgot to send your slaves along when you were exiled. A darned nuisance, that.*

Give me your map. There you are. Tell her I sent you, and she&apos;ll handle the rest.
At one time I thought we&apos;d face this moment together.
*A spark crackles between you. Visions flash before your eyes - you, using the air to cow your foes... or mastering water to leave them cold and helpless... or watching them fall as the earth moves beneath you.*
Dwarf Prisoner
But you haven&apos;t answered my question. Who are you?
Remarkable! A brave hero and a cunning foe from the Ancient War, preserved in their final battle.
You got business inside, you ought to make it quick.
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry to hear that.*
*The creature warns you away with a throat-melting groan.*
I suppose this is my fault for hiring some... some horrid elf barbarian!

*Gareth&apos;s head is steady but his face is pale and his eyes are lost.*
So journey forth and tread the proper trail...
&lt;i&gt;Fool!&lt;/i&gt; No hell knows the wrath I&apos;ll unleash upon you!
*Once, this was a fishmonger&apos;s. Or a tackle shop.*
[Furiously-scribbled notes cover the parchment front and back. The pace seems to slow as the scrawl reaches the end of the page. Only the last lines are legible.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... seems amenable, though it is undoubtedly a shock. His own father, after all. Still, I can draw no other conclusion. They are to blame, and Lucian was no less guilty.
*Demand passage.*
Nothing. Huh. What can I say? You carry an air of... mystery.
You take me for a fool. Good day to you. Don&apos;t let the door hit you on the way out.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 35: The History of Braccus Rex

Alongside Adramahlihk, the victorious Godwoken rose to Divinity. Can their alliance hold? Who will win the battle between dark and light?
Besides, what&apos;s the alternative? Guard this door forever? Feed them like pets? Get yourself together, man.

We told the Elven Scion of the Shadow Prince&apos;s demise.
You are about to enter a higher level area and will not be able to return to the current area. Open quests will be closed and archived. Are you sure you want to proceed? Things may get very brutal.
Love? Duna&apos;s beard, is that what passes for sense amongst the lower classes? She is quite enamoured with me, of course. I can be - well, irresistible.
