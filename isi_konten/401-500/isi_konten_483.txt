*Scratch your chin. Interesting, interesting. Now how about the other song?*
Maybe... but... no. No. It&apos;s too dangerous. I can&apos;t see more Seekers lost. I won&apos;t.
Well, that unlocked something... or locked it.
*Slide into the woman&apos;s memories.*
Are... are you sure? Them Sourcerers from the caravan...
This place is not for you. Leave.
My friends here tell me that demonologist I mentioned isn&apos;t far from here - off the island somewhere, they say. Do go have a chat with him. You won&apos;t regret it.
that the world may never forget the greatest heroes Rivellon had ever seen.
*Take his hand.*
This is unbecoming of a dwarf, my daughter. I pray you realise that.
Please. You&apos;re too ugly. But Cap&apos;d probably look forward to spillin&apos; yer guts for the fun of it.&lt;br&gt;
*Well someone had better go looking for him. Ask which way he went.*
He&apos;s dead... he&apos;s dead...
*Ask about these dusty wolves.*
*Ask what&apos;s been going on.*
I don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;to be.
That doesn&apos;t sound promising...
How about this: if you can guess the answer to my riddle, I&apos;ll give you a delightful discount on Sourcerous Sundries, hmmm?
I must admit, I had no intention of visiting a demon&apos;s home plane when we set out for Arx. Now we&apos;re the wiser, I suppose.
Boosted [1]
Nice try, but you&apos;re stuck with me... at least until we figure some way out of these close quarters.
Our world abounds with demons and dark forces - those who prey on the weak. They are a curse, but we were a scourge upon them.
*Offer the traditional elven greeting, then ask him how he died.*
I am the Devourer, a dragon who darkened the skies of Rivellon. And I have chose you as my champion.
For now, I go back to the kingdom. There&apos;s a lot to do there. Damage that needs undone. Dwarves&apos;ve lived in fear for too long, on the outside &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the inside.
This richly bound book contains the names of the Seekers fallen in battle against the forces of the Void.
[BARBARIAN] *Tell him you don&apos;t like shows.*
I can help you with that. I can share my bond with the Source with you - fill your well to the brim, make you a master. The rest of the story - well - it&apos;s yours to write.
Elven Warrior
*Do just that. Turn and go.*
HALT
Large Sword
Hmm. Pity. I certainly saw you with the crown of power on your head. A shame you didn&apos;t see it too.
There is not much mirth to be had these days. But the Gods turning to the creations they&apos;ve abused to save them? What could be more hilarious than &lt;i&gt;that? &lt;/i&gt;Well - I do have &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; idea...
*Say you bear no news but seek it yourself.*
This potted ingredient grows.
Ah. It&apos;s you. You&apos;ll want your reward, I suppose?
Decide how to deal with the dwarf.
&lt;b&gt;We are not trapped. We are home. This girl&apos;s body will be our vessel. This city will be our larder.&lt;/b&gt;
*Pull open the door.*
Tomb of Garrick
What&apos;s going on...? I was having terrible dreams... there was something crawling about inside of me... making me &lt;i&gt;do things&lt;/i&gt;...
*The spirit whispers...*
You&apos;d better keep away from things that don&apos;t belong to you in future.
*You peer at the statue and recognise the face as that of the goddess Amadia. You read something about her once, long ago.*
Oh no! I&apos;m sorry to hear that. Mine didn&apos;t start all that well, but it improved immensely.
And you, my fellow adventurers. I don&apos;t think I can leave the responsibility for this with you.
After that&apos;s done, He&apos;ll be able to exorcise the demon. It&apos;s... almost too simple to be true. I guess we&apos;ll see what kind of fellow this &apos;Advocate&apos; turns out to be.
Be quick about it, who knows when that Magister might return?
*Note the grave look on the elf&apos;s face and say that you heard a Seeker died while searching the ship...*
The grateful Mari suggested we meet her cousin - White Magister Reimond.
Do you think me as soft-brained as a child? I know what you are. I smell it on your corpse. You &lt;i&gt;reek &lt;/i&gt;of Source.
Don&apos;t be obscene. He&apos;s as human as you or I. They&apos;ve only... put him through something. Something terrible.
*You can&apos;t stomach more, though Diliana is prodding you, pushing you. &lt;i&gt;&apos;There is more to know&apos;,&lt;/i&gt; she insists, and motions to the lizard limb before you. &lt;i&gt;&apos;This is your duty.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
We consumed the spirit of the Craftmistress.
*...with a rending, tearing sound that fills the whole wide world, your blood thins and dirties and your nobility - as much a part of you as was your heart - is torn away, and you are left bereft.*
Very well, I can see them straining against your fangs. Unleash them, Godwoken. Ask your questions.
The boss has certain... exclusive wares for a few choice customers. You seem like the type to appreciate such things, thought you&apos;d be interested. It never hurts to take our minds off these terrible times.
&lt;i&gt;Hyaaaaaaaargghhhhhhh!!&lt;/i&gt;
Look. They may not want me around anymore, but I&apos;m no snitch!
*Inner doubt rips through your mind, soul, and body. The pressure builds... and builds...*
It is over, isn&apos;t it? This voice, this body - they were never mine to guide, were they? Rest... yes. I am ready.
Ugh... I never want to be higher off the ground than I can jump - not &lt;i&gt;ever again&lt;/i&gt;.
You say that now. Let&apos;s see how you feel when you realise the &lt;i&gt;true &lt;/i&gt;implication of a world filled with Sourcerers.
[VILLAIN] *Tell her you&apos;d make very good use of such instruments. Very good use indeed...*
*Shake your head. Is this all a joke to him?*
*Suck her dry of Source.*
What do you mean...? You mean... my gods, were we too late?
His realm knew peace, and the world did not burn.

Sadha will always come first, but of course gods do tend to have a rather large appetite, don&apos;t they?&lt;br&gt;
*Ask her to tell you more - what were her boys like?*
Where is your collar?!
[SEBILLE] *Tell him it&apos;s lizards he ought to worry about... and his own kind besides.*
To snuff out all those lives would&apos;ve been akin to genocide. You did the right thing.
*He takes a deep breath, then bows to you.*
Arhu the wizard became one of Lucian&apos;s most trusted advisors once more.
*Tell her you&apos;ve encountered this Windego. It was... not a pleasant event.*
Help the other survivors; I can dust myself off just fine...
An ominous phrase. It&apos;s as if I can feel the onset of night.
[SCHOLAR] *Ask her if the great intellects of Champion Academy would have offered the same cold welcome.*
*Text appears before your eyes once more.*
*Lay a hand on his shoulder. You&apos;re here if he needs you.*
She loves me, she loves me not...
Makeshift Two-Handed Axe
So easily fooled! Drape a little bit of money over a dead pig, and folks&apos;d say it was the second coming of Lucian.
I have an offer, if you&apos;ll hear it. There&apos;s a great deal I could show you, regarding the power within you. A great deal of potential I could unlock. But there&apos;s something I need, too...

Find the red lizard princess.
If not for your crimes, I would never have been reunited with my people.
*Wonder who this &apos;Reimond&apos; might be.*
*Sigh. The guilt weighs heavy on your shoulders. You acted rashly; it was not yet the time for an uprising.*
Go on. Get outta here. Before I change my mind.
Colleagues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has come to my attention that some workers have been &lt;i&gt;slacking off&lt;/i&gt;. This is unacceptable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The pace must be increased if we are to satisfy the Lady Dallis&apos; bidding. Do not make me bring painful incentive into the equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reimond&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The page this note has been written on is covered in vulgar doodles that the captions suggest depict said Lady Dallis and Magister Reimond in some unorthodox ritual positions.]
You waste my time. You&apos;ll not waste more.
*Friends? Tell him friends don&apos;t enslave the races of other friends.*
*Shudder. You&apos;ve seen enough Voidwoken for one lifetime.*

I bid you... good day.
Very good.
We move, Seekers. Now is the time to resist. &lt;i&gt;The Lady Vengeance will be ours!&lt;/i&gt;

It&apos;s beyond fixing. Like the rest of these poor souls here. Here, see for yourself.
*Say you meant no disrespect; it&apos;s just that the Divine is, after all, &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt;, even by the Divine Order&apos;s admission.*
*Ask if it was he who sent the explosive toys to the wedding.*

*As you walk through the library Harina expresses her condolences: it is a shame the King forbade further investigation into the Veil. It was a fascinating topic.*
...and once the Deathfog spreads across Arx, I&apos;ll cross off another.
*The spirit stands there smiling, utterly oblivious to her own outburst, leaving you to ponder the strange words she shouted: &lt;i&gt;mamtehnem rnekt oood il!*&lt;/i&gt;
Sure. Go ahead. I don&apos;t need it when this place is half burned to the ground!
Mm. Mm. Mm.
*Ask him to enlighten you. Who&apos;s Isbeil?*
I admit, I thought it was a beautiful little piece of irony, but it is somewhat grim, I&apos;ll grant you that.
*An intense-looking man steps between the thug and the elf and rolls up his sleeves, revealing well-muscled and heavily-scarred arms.*
After some persuading he starts jabbering in their speech - and the thing bloody &lt;i&gt;bursts. &lt;/i&gt;Hammond and the elf get a face-full of poison.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Arx Prison Master Key
*The spirit of the owl known as Jimmy hops heavily from claw to claw, squinting up at you over his bulging fluffy cheeks.*
&lt;i&gt;GUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!&lt;/i&gt;
...no! You...! You the monster...!
* - and then he is gone.*
*Say that you&apos;re curious about her tattoos. Names, are they not?*
And this used to be &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a nice neighbourhood.
Oh... now you&apos;ll make me talk business!
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the statue behind.

Move along there, elf.
*Shake your head sadly and say he should stay true to Sadha.*
*Ask why he didn&apos;t save Alexandar.*
I am a &lt;i&gt;rare trophy animal&lt;/i&gt;, not some gaudy parrot! I just... with this sickness, I can&apos;t quite recall what I am, exactly...
How about you tell me something of yourself - I&apos;d like to know just who my valiant rescuers are...
*Ifan smiles and moves even closer, nuzzling at your neck with his nose. His beard tickles your reddening throat. Aside from your voice, the only sound is the whisper of fabric between your bodies.*
A new Divine will ascend. Bishop Alexandar, if we&apos;re lucky. And it&apos;s him, not your towers and your spells, that&apos;ll save us.
