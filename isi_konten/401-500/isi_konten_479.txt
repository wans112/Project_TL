I&apos;ve never seen one up close.
*Say it&apos;s probably for the best, all things considered.*
Pfeh! &apos;s &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; tongue that should be looking for some action!
If I have to deal with one more buck looking to court me, I&apos;ll take a chunk out of his ear!
*Tell her you&apos;re going to free the hanging prisoner. Offer her ten gold coins to look the other way.*
[BARBARIAN] *Growl that you let a slug get the better of you once before - you won&apos;t let it happen again...*
Beach Cozy
There&apos;s a Lone Wolf contract out on the Godwoken.
Flaming Club
Yarrow gratefully reunited with Migo. Even in his madness, he recognised his daughter.
[1] determines how well you can Charm in dialogues.
Stay strong on your holy mission, Godwoken.
How &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; you. &lt;i&gt;How dare you.&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;m forced to dig my murdered parent&apos;s graves. To watch the soil cover them, little by little. And a clown wanders in to &lt;i&gt;dance on them.&lt;/i&gt;
You&apos;re right. Pearst wouldn&apos;t want me to wallow - he&apos;d want me to carry on with our mission. Let&apos;s get moving.
Maximum Summons
Do you wish to move forward?
Richly Bound Book
You have a good heart.
*Report that yes - you did indeed.*
Why not. I love a good story.
Make Firewater the Lone Wolf say the name &apos;Edie Engrym&apos;.
*Gasping on the fumes, you are dragged to safety by a wolf, a wolf who appears out of nowhere. He pulls you free, clawing an elven woman who gets in your way. She collapses, wheezing under the choking dust.*
*Tell him to leave it be. Whatever he&apos;s up to appears to be a fool&apos;s errand.*
Welcome to the spider&apos;s web, darling little flies.
F12
I like this place. It&apos;s nice.

*He passed the test and you were murdered. And all the time you knew him, &lt;i&gt;he never spoke your name.*&lt;/i&gt;
Most of my wares were lost in the attack, but I did manage to salvage &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of our Sourcerous Sundries. Maybe you&apos;d be interested in taking a look?
*His head suddenly falls forward. He starts to sob, though no tears fall from his wounded eyes.*
I&apos;d wish you good luck, but I&apos;ve a feeling you&apos;re the one who won&apos;t need it.
May Lucian return.
*The scent fills your mind and your vision starts to swim. You blink and find yourself standing in a dark glade. On the wind you hear a whisper.*
*The scent of incense abounds as the Red Princess reclines luxuriously upon large pillows embroidered with mythical scenes.*
[SCHOLAR] *You see a mark on the side of the figurehead - it&apos;s a living scar, used to enslave elves.*
Surrounded by Deathfog, Arx slowly starved. Lucian&apos;s great city faded from the world.

We freed Lord Arhu - but when we were ambushed he was too weak to fight.
*Ask her to explain what, exactly, she believes the risks are.*
[Arena_AvailablePlayer_4_3f666e1e-7f5e-43e8-8c02-3c61966147d3]
*Put your arms around her. She needs to go somewhere and rest. The drudanae&apos;s been too much for her.*
Not as pant-wettingly fearsome as Silver Claw, but not bad. Not bad at all.
*Call him an ingrate. You didn&apos;t have to give him anything at all.*
*Wish for knowledge.*
That much at least is apparent. Hm. Alright. We have a deal.
&apos;s our honey. Bog off.
It is...? W-well we must for Sir Gareth then - we can&apos;t leave without him!
[1] new recipes learned.
Dallis and Vredeman are looking for a powerful object that can purge and store infinite Source. The artefact is known as &apos;The Aeteran&apos;.
Is the time at hand?
Everyone in camp&apos;s got to contribute. For food. For protection. No exceptions, especially not for &lt;i&gt;elves&lt;/i&gt;. Griff&apos;s orders.
Necromancer Tamsyn&apos;s Soul Jar
&apos;Here lies Porfiria Swann.&lt;br&gt;Died of shrieking hysteria.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Let the gossips chatter. No matter.&quot;&apos;
Fish Pie
&lt;i&gt;Fie!&lt;/i&gt; Hearrr this feline&apos;s lament, O immorrrtal gods! I am so wrrretched! And what is a Booply Bear without his sweet Mumsy? I say, &lt;i&gt;he is nothing!&lt;/i&gt;
Burnished Ring
*The plinth of the statue bears a series of deep, circular scratches upon its stone - the statue can be rotated.*
Now, as for your reward... this mightn&apos;t be quite what you were expecting, but, well...
Exactor
*Wonder what a Seeker is doing here, of all places.*
What a cursed Lucian&apos;s Day this is...
[1] allows you to repair your own items. The higher, the faster you repair. Required to create and improve weapons and armour if any metal is involved.
Why sir, you smell... divine. Do you eat cheese?
*Say you&apos;d like to see what she has to sell.*
I wonder what happened to his orcish Godwoken...
Nightsky Amulet
Trying to hide, are you? Don&apos;t do that.
Too heavy. Needs a lever, a key, or a troll.
Lake 03
Dungeon - Empty Room Dead End A
*Take offence. Tell him that Duna deems you worthy of divinity!*
*His eyes narrow.*
*Focus on his nostalgia.*
Oh yes, that I do. Some older than even this isle upon which we stand. Trinkets from ancient humans, relics from fossilised dwarves and what-have-you...
That&apos;s it, off you trot! Lest you want to end up like old Finn did...
Who summons m- What? One of &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you are a master, the Champion of Fort Joy Arena.*
*Soften your voice and ask again if she&apos;d please remove your Source collar.*
Potion of Nimble Fingers
*Tell her you&apos;re not going to remain here. You&apos;ll leave Fort Joy or die trying.*
*Smash the jar to pieces.*
*Say it&apos;s been quite the journey so far.*
Rahimus
&lt;i&gt;The House of Shadows&lt;/i&gt; stirs!
Nothing, until I know the way is clear! Get that collar removed, purge those Shriekers of their Source, and return to me when it&apos;s safe.
*Smile. Eye him mockingly. You know precisely what you must do.*
Corpse Explosion Stone Huge
*The spirit spins around and levels her blade at yet another foe - you. But it&apos;s already too late...*
*Say that you want Exter to join you - his longbow could prove invaluable.*
I guess this will have to do.
*In Mordus&apos; dungeon, it called itself &apos;Xhaxh&apos;. Demand to know more.*
A
Alice Alisceon died a painful, unfair death.
*Tell her to accept fate for what it is.*
Lucian and Damian.
Trust is all we have here. I do not counterfeit. I have... honour.
I&apos;ve a proposition for you. I&apos;ll reveal if I&apos;m telling the truth, but only &lt;i&gt;if &lt;/i&gt;you disown your God.
Bandit Dwarf Nature Warden
*Tell the Magister that you did see someone hiding in a barrel nearby.*
There&apos;s one here. It&apos;s pretty.
Together we are a force to be reckoned with, but if we seek to survive the onslaught of the Void, we stand no chance unless we become &lt;i&gt;vastly&lt;/i&gt; more powerful than we are now.
*Tell it that in order for you to be able to continue this conversation, you&apos;ll need it to give you the password.*
Sadha entrusted me with one of her eggs. It will respond to fire. A dragon will hatch!
Beast by name, and so, it would seem, by nature.
*Tell her her magic is uncanny. She even tasted the same as she-of-dreams.*
If Boss trusts you to find somethin&apos; for him, you better not disappoint &apos;im. You wouldn&apos;t like &apos;im when he&apos;s disappointed.
Vignette Window
Sewers Beneath the Prison
You want to enter the tomb of Lucian, don&apos;t you?
What I know is not for your ears - not without the permission of Lord Arhu! That&apos;s my final word on the matter!
My child, my sweet Fane! You positively brim with Source. It is good to see you more like your old self.
TO ALL CONCERNED WITH THE CAVE DIG&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only those with authorisation may enter the cave and proceed to the dig site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not attempt to travel to the dig alone. In the first antechamber you must await the Blind Guide. He and only he may guide you through our defences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Failure to observe this instruction will result in your death and a great deal of inconvenience to our lady Dallis. You may decide for yourself which is worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- R
We&apos;ll just see about that!
*Treacherous undead! Draw your weapon and defend yourself.*
...I just didn&apos;t know. I didn&apos;t know what darkness lied &lt;i&gt;beyond&lt;/i&gt; pain. Now, well. Now I do.
*Ask that she purify the feathers - you have great deeds to accomplish with Duna&apos;s armour.*
No, no, no, it is not wine that makes me dream. Hmmm. It is quite another balm:
You should have just forgotten about all of this...
It&apos;s not too late, Master Fane. We can fix everything that went wrong. &lt;i&gt;Everything.&lt;/i&gt;
Arcane goods, over here!
Well then. You already have your answer. If you&apos;ve spoken to him, he must be safe. Is he?
*Tell him you are the champion of elves and dwarves, and he &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;listen to you.*
Where are the smells?! I miss the smells!
The Empress gave the dragon&apos;s bones, and I spent every waking hour perfecting the design.
*Step back and leave the Paladin to her fate.*
I can&apos;t let that happen...
Flattening Boots
*He catches your hand before it can make contact. His grip is like a vice.*
I know the sand must be warm, but all I feel is a deep chill.
Marla
*Scowl and say that you didn&apos;t need to eat the damn stuff to learn that.*
...uuuuice?
[SEBILLE] &lt;i&gt;*&apos;Give or take&apos;? &lt;/i&gt;You remember every kill. Show him your arm.*
Pitcher
*Another click.*
We should stay here until we&apos;re sure we&apos;ve checked every nook and cranny.
It might be if you quit preoccupying me. If Kemm says we&apos;ll find something, then we&apos;ll find something, and that&apos;s that.
You&apos;re pathetic. Ha! You want to hit me, don&apos;t you? Go on then - give it your best shot!
*Promise him. You would never do something like that.*
*Tell him you&apos;re with him - you&apos;ll kill the Divine Order scum.*
What&apos;s it to ya, slow-wit?
Use Delorus&apos; boat to escape.
Boletus Seedling
*He considers you for a moment. He inhales. He exhales. He nods.*
And then suddenly I&apos;m here, apparently facin&apos; the elven inquisition.
The are part of a private collection now - Lord Kemm&apos;s. Perhaps he&apos;ll grant you a viewing... but I doubt it.
What would he say if he could see us now...
Oh by the Seven, what did I do?!
They are rivals. They are enemies. They must never be mistaken for anything else.
The annals of elvendom are written in flesh - elves eat of the dead and absorb their memories. Now, the elves are in peril. An unforgettable hero must rise.
Small Thunder Rune Of Power
*Snap your fingers. Demand that she concentrate and tell you what caused this carnage.*
Do not mock me. You know what lies beneath. But I will not allow you another step closer. Qanna&apos;s already laid claim to it.
I discovered the existence of ancient implements called &lt;i&gt;Swornbreakers&lt;/i&gt;. They are rumoured to be able to break any magical pact, including the Covenant.
*Note that the dwarven thug seems happy to rip off one of her own... or at least someone who looks the part*
*Say you don&apos;t respond to threats.*
Bonecage
Here! Take the key and in you go... we&apos;re not going to lay down our lives for some Silent Monks.
*Gasp!* Kitty! No!
*The Magister&apos;s stern face slackens and turns pale.*
This horrifying brew reeks of a disturbing bovine mix. It was prepared by the Witch in the fields near Driftwood.
Did they regret the deal with the demon?
*He gives you his mischievous grin.*
You met me as a Lone Wolf... but did I ever tell you of my past in the Divine Order?
*Your admission only seems to make him more furious.*
Did I say aficionado? My sweet boy, you are a connoisseur!
