*You remember how overbearing the Mother Tree was. You&apos;re not sure you want to become such a ruler.*
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Understanding is all rather relative.
Excuse me? Why am I being spoken of in the past tense? That...that is an insult.
*Apologise.*
Death Wish
*Insist that there&apos;s no time to spare. It&apos;s time to go. &lt;i&gt;Now.*&lt;/i&gt;
So that&apos;s that. I didn&apos;t want to be there anyway.
*Question him. That doesn&apos;t make sense - he was already in the middle of packing when you arrived.*
A trapped soul, at last liberated.
Saheila offered to help us improve our mastery of Source by connecting us with the roots of the Ancestor Trees that lie all across the world, deep beneath its surface. We accepted her aid.
&apos;ullo, mister lizard!
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? A suspicious creeper?
All this extra work, you&apos;d think we&apos;d get a few kind words now and again.
Void Ravager
...good enough for me.
Dwarven criminals lured a ship called the Peacemaker to its doom. On board, they found a shipment of Deathfog.
[DWARF] *Declare that you&apos;re not looking for trouble, unless he&apos;s intent on causing some for you.*
And what kind of Divine led the fight,
*Shrug and say people see castles in the sky. Might as well see them in the sea.*
...the secret to passing the Path of Blood. My other servant is disposable; if his death makes your task easier... so be it.
Smooth Belt
We found the diary of a long-dead adventurer. He was after the gauntlets of the Devourer, supposedly hidden in the tower of Braccus Rex.
Decide Wyvlia&apos;s fate.
It &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt;, doesn&apos;t it?
*The machine creaks to life and the Deathfog begins to flow through the other pipe.*
[LIZARD] *Say there&apos;s no love lost between elves and lizards.*
I&apos;m sure you only meant that in jest... but you can&apos;t force the muse, my friend.
*Say you&apos;ve had enough sore surprises here. Ask him to send you home.*
Heh! You again! What is it this time?
My princess was to marry that vile cur, but instead he took exception to her outspoken nature - he cursed her and all of her retinue, including me!
Reimond&apos;s a good sort. You&apos;ll see.
And that is all you are, aren&apos;t you? A red puddle of madness.

*He looks at you in surprise, passing his eyes quickly over you.*
But there must be more...
*As the Source flows into your body, you feel a sudden gloom. Your helmet starts to twist and warp. Darkness pours from it, and a demon steps out from your shadow.*
*Ask if it&apos;s responsible for the destruction at the harbour.*
*Inform that Knight&apos;s spirit that the Sallow Man is dead. He can consider himself avenged.*
Well.
The God King&apos;s punishment awaits. I pray it arrives soon.
Waiting here could give them a full life in Amadia&apos;s grace. But the swamps are death, and the Magisters - even worse than that...
A fair question. My name is Withermoore. I have been trapped here... I know not how long. Long enough that my flesh has long since withered to dust. Long enough that your visage is... quite foreign to me.
But I still don&apos;t like to see it.
Justinia&apos;s father. His death was... mysterious, as I recall.
[RED PRINCE] *Look away in doubt. It&apos;s early days yet to talk of divinity.*
You might be Godwoken. But it ain&apos;t all about &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
Return to the spirit of Edie Engrym.
*Sigh!* Oh, to be a dwarf. You lucky, lucky thing!
The Gods must have had good reason to keep this from us. We should not let it shake our resolve.
It&apos;s a city at a crossroads. Volumes could be written about a single conflict, yet Arx endures an infinitude at once.
My lad&apos;s gonna wanna make sure his ma&apos;s alright, after that.
Amadia&apos;s blessing turned the pig back into a human.
Big Two-Headed Warhammer
Not enough to trouble a fine specimen such as yourself!
Hold it there! You are under arrest! Looks like you&apos;ll be spending some time in prison.
And to think I once sparred with her. How wretched.
I&apos;m sure you do. Later, bub.
Trethon&apos;s Robe
Lord Eredor&apos;s Hand
So soon? Oh, that&apos;s too bad. It gets so lonely here...
The arch-demon possessed Doctor Daeva and left the island. Eleanessa urged us to find him. And kill him.
*She doesn&apos;t lift her eyes from the bottle, but quickly corrects it to face you. She looks up then, drawing an arc with her eyes from the bottle&apos;s tip to your gaze. Her dark eyes are deeper, lusher, than ever before.*
Fine-spun yarn crafted from the fleece of happy sheep. Delicate on its own, but several skeins braided together might be of more formidable use.
I spent a night of passion with the Red Prince. Despite his deep love for Sadha, he clearly has a crush on me as well.
I can&apos;t imagine you picked that up in Fort Joy! You&apos;re welcome, sister. Even with the collar.
*Ask what could hold back the King and the Void?*
You must call her spirit back from the dark, guide her into the light. Let your voice be the shepherd that leads the lamb through the valley of wolves. Go on! Call to her!
*Shake your head. You have unfinished business to attend to first.*
They killed most of us, and then Voidwoken appeared to drag the rest off to a cave near the ruins.
*Leave him be.*
*Leave him to it.*
*You try to take a deep breath. You try to remember who you are. Your name is Lohse. You love music.  You are Lohse. Remember. Remember.*
*Say nothing - this is Fane&apos;s business.*
I hope it burns your tongue to say my name. Don&apos;t think yourself atoned for what you did, Lone Wolf. But me... I&apos;m free of you now. To the Halls I&apos;ll go.
*Tell the Magister you&apos;re not looking for a fight.*
They&apos;re still there, spreading their rancid smell through the house. Paladins came to clean up the mess. In the name of Lucian, they say, and they seem to believe it.
This vessel is unlike any I have seen! Let us hurry - there are secrets to be plied from these boards.
&lt;i&gt;The Doctor thanks you for your help on Bloodmoon Island. Some advice from him, in thanks... explore the gardens of Linder Kemm. An entrance to his vault of treasures lies hidden there...&lt;/i&gt;
*He looks from the ground to the bow and continues sanding.*
*This time he hisses loudly, the sharpness of the pain getting the better of him.*
*COUGH!* AHEM!
Dorian Gall&apos;s Place
Speak.
Nice doing business with you, I wish I had better wares to offer.
That said, I do have... more secular motivations as well. Arx positively overflows with pilgrims during the festival: pilgrims and their purses.
It will be so much more than merely an honour, I hope.
*Warmth. Comfort. You are Kinnet, playing cards with your mates in a cosy barracks. You stagger to tipsy attention as a white-clad Magister commands that one of your troop seek a lost caravan.*
Lohse... To behold you in this naked glory is to surmount the boundaries of existence and step into a more perfect universe.
The Magisters fought with all the skill you would expect of peasants. Not that we were flawless.
The riches world over do they seek...
*Shaking fingers fold into a crude gesture, one final insult before the bones go still.*
Now now. That&apos;s enough of that.
Ah, today is a fine day, my friend - a fine day indeed.
*Tell him you didn&apos;t ask for any of this. You never wanted to be his chosen.*
*The spirit leans back to appraise you, a guarded look on his spectral features.*
It&apos;s true, you know. What the Magisters say. My brother&apos;s boy Gwydian... he&apos;s got Source in him. When his folks passed, we were all he had. We thought we could keep him safe.
*Examine the second candle.*
The Gods choose &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;as their champion. Some washed-up pirate.
You&apos;ve got guts. I could never deny it.
*Angrily demand to know why after all Zorl-Stissa&apos;s talk of divinity she resorts to this childish game.*
As the forests grew anew and the elves were equals at last, Saheila shared elven knowledge of Source with the world. But some elves disagreed, and plotted against her.
He knew &lt;i&gt;you&apos;d&lt;/i&gt; have to be tricked.
This creates rays of sunlight. Disable this if you don&apos;t like the effect. Disabling this does not yield a whole lot of a performance boost.
*Clink your drink in cheers.*
Confound my drug-addled brain, it is... She. You&apos;re She. The Master&apos;s chosen! W-w-why do you seek me?
Necromancer
Sebille! It is good to see you. We are free, Sebille! Now, where are your friends?
*He shrieks and recoils from your touch.*
I was wondering when you&apos;d make your next appearance...
Well, nothing&apos;s free in life. Hop along now. I have business of my own to attend to.
*Ask to trade.*
*Promise it will be done.*
We found the pages missing from ‘Dwarven Customs &amp; Traditions’.
Now go, and take this ring with you. It is the ancient Circle of Suns. By this ring I make thee one with fire, and one day, by this ring I&apos;ll thee wed.
shot
But that doesn&apos;t mean I had anything to do with the disappearances! I&apos;m a tinkerer - I fix things for a living. I would never hurt anyone!
What. Is. Your. Price.
Lone Wolf guards ahead. I hope they&apos;re friendly.
Phase A Volatility
With Fane&apos;s research on the Veil, the Seven stole their people&apos;s Source and went to war with the King. Aetera couldn&apos;t stop them. The Seven cast the King and the Eternals into the Void.
Do it, then.
*Admit Lohar didn&apos;t send you... but tell him you know about the weapons in the basement.*
Cor, Aldus! He&apos;s the spitting image of that Sourcerer fellow, ain&apos;t he?
So... time to find this Borris fellow.
Your powers of observation astonish me.
*Grab his arm. Try to wrestle yourself free.*
I have some items of value to show you, my lizard friend!
Leave me be, or I&apos;ll... ungh!
Free the dragon.
*She trails off, and limply gestures to her paltry makeshift infirmary.*
[FANE] *A cold fear grips you. A presence you have not felt in a long time. Ask who you&apos;re speaking to.*
Mercury
But you didn&apos;t ask me down here to talk about all &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, did you?
Voidwoken Spider
like the memories of the peoples who had built them,
No... nonono... h-he can&apos;t be dead, that would mean I&apos;m in charge... I c-can&apos;t do it! I can&apos;t!
Indeed. And so I&apos;ll acquiesce.
Leg looks bad, boy. Let&apos;s see if we can patch it up.
Why have you come here? This island is nothing but pain and blood.
Undead Black Ring Painweaver
Pressley&apos;s Locker
Desert - Red Mesa
*Ask what the elves are doing in the region.*
*Tell him to watch his tongue - if you disrespect a Lone Wolf you pay in blood.*
Dead Trader
*Let her suffer.*
Skin Colour
*Say that if he&apos;s needed elsewhere then he&apos;s honour-bound to leave. He doesn&apos;t want to look back and realise he wasted his days guarding petty criminals.*
*Stare at him in shock. So... what&apos;s he going to do?*
Ooooh you know how to make a girl hungry, so you do. I tell you, it&apos;ll be full bellies and happy faces tonight if I can get this one made!
The fool ran into the swamps. He pestered me for aid against the Shriekers, and when I finally told him of a cache of Braccus&apos;s soulforged weapons, he rushed away to find it.
SqueakSqueakSqueak!
Levitate
*Stay silent. Let him continue.*
*Though your spell tore through her like a spear through flesh, Amadia looks grimly happy - if haggard.*
