Lucian blesses me in his own way, soft-slither. I glide on his breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
You would have my gratitude. And whatever aid I could then offer to you.
*Tell him you suppose the Magisters will want to hear about it.*
*His eyes widen. His lip quivers. You expect him to be afraid, even ashamed, but he&apos;s... &lt;i&gt;relieved.*&lt;/i&gt;

Ryker was potentially a powerful ally in the continuing war...
Say your prayers, friend. Say your prayers.
This violence must stop!
Of course you are. We&apos;re taking very good care of each other, aren&apos;t we.
*Grill him. He seriously knows nothing more about this thing he wants to find?*
*She is close to you now, her great, round eyes peering affectionately into your own. She cradles your face in her hand and continues to sing.*
Armies? Merely sheep with swords. Minds that &lt;i&gt;beg &lt;/i&gt;to be controlled.
Come, Marla. You&apos;re one of us, ain&apos;t you? Tell us what happened.
BOCK?!
Put your weapons away, if you know what&apos;s good for you.
You leave me no choice. Prepare to die!
Ochre Ring
*Nod solemnly.  You&apos;re sorry...*
This - this is my academy! It&apos;s where I did my research...
*Say that you presume she wants a word with him. Tell her to go right ahead.*
*Now and forever you&apos;re the Master&apos;s. There is only the Master. There is only the Master.*
Griff was killed before Sebille could talk to him. She&apos;ll have to ask elsewhere.
*The fiery creature gazes upon you, before uttering a disquietening gurgle.*
*That&apos;s heartless. He could be saving people right now!*
*You behold a face you&apos;ve seen before, in blackened glass. Soul-sickness incarnate, the rotten flesh of the world&apos;s most shameful desires, an all-knowing affliction, this is the God King&apos;s pallid envoy...*
Well Fed
*Ask Malady to clarify - does snuffing the candle... &lt;i&gt;snuff the person?!*&lt;/i&gt;
Silence! Those of false faith will never bathe in the dragon&apos;s glory.
*Tell him the roads are dangerous these days.*
Weak Stone Wall
This amulet is cold and wet to the touch, and when pressed to the ear it sounds like harvest rains.
We&apos;ll meet again, Red Prince. Always will I walk beside you.
Gods&apos; blood - fine, if you insist on racing to the Hall of Echoes...
*Your heart pounds like an angry fist inside your chest.  The insistence of it is a challenge and a comfort. Be worthy of your blood. Be worthy of this power.*
But if the mother endures, the father must die. Face my phantoms, Red Prince.

Looking fresh from some hellish abattoir, it&apos;s hard to imagine that this dismembered torso was once a walking, talking, thinking being. Just like you.

*Keep up the charade, asking if a lowly servant like yourself can enquire as to what Braccus did to her.*
*Tell him he isn&apos;t responsible for you. You&apos;re leaving.*
I inquire because I enjoy painting a picture, a picture with which I&apos;m so very &lt;i&gt;intimately&lt;/i&gt; familiar.
We convinced him to leave unarmed.
*Tell him you hope he likes his cage, because as far as you&apos;re concerned he can rot in it.*
*Ros peers into your eyes as if looking for a reason to believe you - and his face softens.*
The Devourer
Duna mentioned this&apos;d happen. If someone has to wield power, it ought not to be someone who&apos;s already proven themselves corruptible.
We must stop it while we can, before it leaves a trail of blood in its wake.
Sounds like she needs help...
*Glance towards his easel and wonder aloud how he could even consider painting at a time like this...*
*You feel as if your mind, once but a single palace, becomes a city, then an empire, then a whole world filled with every morsel of knowledge and power ever accumulated by any elf since the birth of the species.*
You didn&apos;t know my little one. My little egg baby, my little chick baby, my little littlest pre-chick baby egg...
*The kids vanish... and you hear the grumbling of a couple of... &lt;i&gt;trolls.*&lt;/i&gt;
Cow Talk
Stool
A perfect, orange death-globe of possibilities.
FOR RIVELLON!
*Tell her you&apos;ll do exactly that.*
Poor cat! No good omen, I think...
*The dog keeps sight of the shiny red ball, waiting for her turn.*
No. I got no excuse. I&apos;m going to do what I can to stop the queen. I suggest you try the same. Get to Arx. End this - before Justinia does.
*Scoff. You would never do such a thing!*
We see the golden throne. We see you: the shimmering flame amid the gold.
Persuasion: Charm, Intimidate or Reason with NPCs
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast, the matter unresolved.
Find a way to save the other cow.
Fretful Rat
Report the caravan attack to the Magisters.
You don&apos;t know - you didn&apos;t see it! It was awful.
*Inform her that the uncorrupted egg was broken.*
&apos;Stonegarden. Be welcome.&apos;
My, my, Sebille! How you positively brim with Source. No wonder, after all the adventures you have had; all the things you&apos;ve had to do...
Anathema is near. If not here, then deeper within. We will slay living and undead alike. There will be no mercy!
The polymorphed cows have fled.
!@#$%^
*You see him sitting around a campfire with a band of Lone Wolves, laughing as their leader tells a tale.*
You&apos;re still here being all scaly and weird, I see. No offence, etc.
*Ask the strange figure who - or what - it is.*
Ah yes. Are you glad you gave him my name? This is what happened. He ailed me. I, the physician, healed myself. But I forgive you. We can get past this together.
As soon as we asked him about it, he fled. Who knows what he&apos;s done with our divine brothers.
Nasty Deeds
But more than that, I am trying to get to Reaper&apos;s Coast. There is an excavation site at the Blackpits oilfields there that holds answers.
I guess it&apos;s sort of like sitting around the dinner table with someone who&apos;s in a really bad mood. You can try to enjoy your meal, but your food loses its flavour, and your appetite shrivels up, and in the end all you can feel is what they feel.
Go on - burn me!
The damned cells were empty. The Magisters arrested hundreds, but they&apos;re not here. They&apos;re gone.
*Say you love this moment; you love the feeling of her body against yours, her heat, her burning heat...*
The Shadow Prince is on this island, seeking our annihilation.
I suspect it has seen better days.
Do not lament, Seekers. Your sacrifice is not in vain.

*Tell him you know an excellent one about a dragon king. He ruled vast lands and married a beautiful elf princess.*
Well done! You made it through! Well... &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of you.
*Ask what he makes of the gods, the tree, and... everything.*
Help! Somebody &lt;i&gt;help! &lt;/i&gt;VOIDWOKEN!
That might have been my only chance...
Hmm. &apos;Thieves&apos; guild,&apos; you say? If I knew of such a guild, I wouldn&apos;t be inclined to speak of it, now would I?
*Ask him about the most recent time that he heard from Arhu.*
*His body stiffens, as if enduring a harsh wind.*
*Interrupt the pleasantries. What is it they want of you?*
*She nods her broad head approvingly.*
I&apos;ve warned you enough, prisoner. Not another word.
Ha! Oops, I think I broke her.
The horizon&apos;s clear for now. We ought to move out, though.
*Creeeeeeeeeeeeak... click...*
*A trembling spirit wrings his hands, his eyes darting around the room. They settle on you.*
Sweet Blessings
Don&apos;t I know it.
Oh, dear Lucian, how blessed I am to greet the pilgrim worthy to walk your path!&lt;br&gt;
This was a mistake. This was a terrible, terrible mistake.
The Avatar of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[Here, Huwbert speculates on the origins of the first Divine. He believes that the Seven gods united to create a lone, mortal champion whom they could empower to repel the Void. This, he believes, happened many times before the rise of Lucian. He finds it surprising that Lucianâ€™s replacement has not emerged to combat the Voidwoken. He suspects that this may be because Lucian himself will return. (Here, a note of anxiety creeps into the text, as if Cranley were feeling... fearful.)]
They knew him to be Godwoken. They sought to kindle the divinity slumbering deep within his soul.
Do you not realise what you are?
You... you&apos;ll put this to good use, I think. Thank you for your help. Truly.
*Change your mind.*
N-not yet, Lord Kemm... but we will!
She&apos;s mute; we need to free her tongue.

Gareth says we must always help others. This was my privilege. Go in peace.
Shiny! Looks like the world is your oyster after all.
A fair sum. But... we have a deal. Here are the terms: I lend you the gold, and you leave me... a part of yourself. The contract is, as the sign says, bonded by blood. The debt is repaid, at fifty percent, or you die.
*Hold your hands up. Fair enough - he should finish what he started.*
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you, Prince. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
[VILLAIN] *Whisper in his ear - ask him if he&apos;s comfortable; is his grave cold and dark enough?*
It was for the good of the many. Sometimes sacrifices must be made.
*Back away.*
Honestly, you turn your back for just a few millennia and the world goes to stink...
Here, take this tome, I believe you will find it challenging, but rewarding.
No... die here... *gasp*... monsters in the water... monsters in the deep...
*Produce the blade you found in the archives.*
Haaarrruuurrgh!
You had no right to take that!
I&apos;d sooner take my business to Blackpeak Isle than stay here a moment longer.
*Quicker than quick, he plants himself in front of you, one scarred hand solid against your chest.*
*Refuse to snuff out the candle.*
Alexandar is alive. When he wakes from his coma he&apos;ll have questions to answer.
*Search the imp for what he knew about the machine.*
*Inquire after the Hollow Marshes. What is this place?*
You shine like the others, but different. They&apos;re grrreen and yellow. You&apos;re... diamond-white.
*Your greatest desire? How could she possibly grant such a thing?*
Me too. If we hadn&apos;t met way back when, I can&apos;t honestly say where I&apos;d be now - for better or worse, we&apos;re in it together, aren&apos;t we.
[SCHOLAR] *Suggest there must be a compromise that&apos;d satisfy you both.*
*As your fingertips brush the cool stone, you feel the depths of your being crack open. The relic seeks your power, yet you have none to give.*

Aren&apos;t you supposed to be the bright one?

Ooh, I knew a man named Ollie, &apos;n&apos; he was all I had. &apos;til Damian came one mornin&apos;, put an arrow through his back...
The cart was good-going, but we hit a snag. Those bloody skeletons had lain a trap for us.
