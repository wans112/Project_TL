Those beasts weren&apos;t any match for you, eh? Glad to see it. Now let&apos;s find the others.
Puzzle
*Pinched of face and stern of features, the spirit of a matronly nun eyes you gravely above her prayer beads.*
&lt;i&gt;...Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt; Is it true? You&apos;re like me?
Ship Upper Deck 01
*Smile. Thank the gods he came to his senses.*
Back so soon, &lt;i&gt;my prince?&lt;/i&gt;
I do hope the Kemms might reopen the school. Children should not suffer from our misdeeds.
Let&apos;s get to the finale, shall we? It&apos;s not like this little discussion was getting us anywhere.
*Breathe. Try to quell the agitation within.*
The Final Word
*You step forward to protect Hardwin as the axe comes around. In a moment you&apos;re staring at the ceiling with Thom&apos;s hands pressing on your neck. A tavern wench is screaming...*
*She taps your map. The resulting dent appears in the Blackpits.*
Have no illusions. Our cure will not heal &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. But it &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;heal all of Rivellon of those monsters. Would you like to see a demonstration?
Deidara&apos;s Amulet
Immemorial Thunder
Jus&apos; that I trust ya out there. The Order&apos;s got Justinia&apos;s back. Always have. When you went against her, you went against them. You got the guts, is all I&apos;m sayin&apos;. Least someone does.
Hmm... I assume you must be a fan of I, the esteemed Cranley Huwbert, if you saw fit to &lt;i&gt;invite yourself into my private chambers.&lt;/i&gt;
Rhalic
Looks it, yes. But I sense something... more. Something sinister.
An Eternal does not answer questions from whatever creatures happen to lumber into view! Especially when there is so much to be learned about their Source...
Hmmm? Why yes, I suppose answering them &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the polite thing to do.
Time to get outta here. If I ever run into the queen, I&apos;ll let &apos;er know some lizard were out here doin good deeds.
I went to the Hall of Echoes. My parasite gave me Spirit Vision to commune with the dead and Source Vampirism to steal their Source.
You... you saved Arx. For that, you have my thanks.&lt;br&gt;
I... I know who&apos;s hunting Godwoken. It&apos;s the Lone Wolves.
Gods at war. Gods at war. I never thought it would come to this.
I&apos;m tryin&apos; to relax here, aren&apos;t I? Whatever&apos;s going on with you and your &lt;i&gt;passenger&lt;/i&gt;, I don&apos;t really need it in my vicinity.
Well, well, well. I go looking for signs of one crime, only to find evidence of another! Come on, then. Off to prison with you.
*He passes his gaze over the fresh corpses bleeding out at his feet.*
Squee squee squee, squee squee squee squeeeeeee!
Pay Lohar a visit.
Magister Greeve
It&apos;s impossible to tell whether it&apos;s the bottle or the liquid within that gives this vintage its sulfur-yellow glow.
But just as I was about to see how it happened, the Magisters beat down my door. This is my last chance to find out the secret. To find out how to save us all.
Reinforced Sabatons
*Tell him you&apos;ve never had an exam end as badly as his seems to have.*
*Leave the dwarf to his work.*
*Tell her you understand. You will do as she asks.*
*Tell him the game is up: you met with the real Baran Levere, or rather: his spirit.*
Kemm? &lt;i&gt;Linder&lt;/i&gt; Kemm? All the better that he&apos;s avoiding Paulina like the porcine plague, then. This rot has infected the very soil we tread and the air we breathe. I must not let it reach the kingdom...
*Death Heralds were responsible for ensuring that dwarves who did not die under the open sky were granted passage to the afterlife.*
*She breathes heavily as she looks past your face, pupils dark and wide as the Void, then resumes her twitchy post.*
Lohar? One more worm, wriggling in the filth.
*Ask if she thinks there still might be a chance. Down the line, maybe.*
Clothing Colour 3
Did she sacrifice others as Lucian had done?
But you... There&apos;s something different about you. A desire to be... seen through, so that I may know you for who you truly are - when you&apos;re yourself &lt;i&gt;alone.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that you&apos;re not interested - there must be some other way to access the Council.*
*The dwarf winks in an exaggerated fashion, squeezing one eye shut so forcefully it looks like his face just swallowed an eyeball. In return, Ifan raises one eyebrow. Slowly.*
*Inquire about the tension between the Paladins and Magisters. Where did it come from?*
*Say you&apos;re not sure who she means.*
*She smiles, her dark eyes glittering.*
A game profile created in Steam is needed to use the cross-save feature.&lt;br&gt;The cross-save feature will be disabled.
Is it time to leave?
Provoke
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her you&apos;re just someone that wants to go home to their books.*
Well, when you run into some enemies that you &lt;i&gt;just - can&apos;t - kill&lt;/i&gt;... you know where to find me.
Rumour had it she were to attend the wedding at Ros&apos; estate, but rumour &lt;i&gt;also &lt;/i&gt;had it she were very, very late. Haven&apos;t heard anything since.
A visit to a demon&apos;s home plane wasn&apos;t on my agenda, but I admit it was an interesting detour. Now, back to reality.
Adept Inquisitor
I&apos;ll mourn her with my morning c-c-c-AWKAWKAW!
I have you on your knees.
Neep? Neep eep!
Mari Pruitt&apos;s Chest
Wasn&apos;t that Prudence? Barkeep at the Black Bull in Driftwood? Mother of Kniles? Oh well. She&apos;s in a better place now. And her sacrifice served a very good cause. But please, let Lohse lead here. This is &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;business.
We left the island behind us, and Slane with it.
Yeah. Same...
*You make it to civilisation. Too late. An explosion devastates the beating heart of the elven city. Ancestor trees thud to earth, strong trunks crack even louder than the horrified screams. A fetid miasma palls the air.*
Get everyone back here, &lt;i&gt;now.&lt;/i&gt; There&apos;s no time to spare.
Let your stumpy legs carry you away, while they still can!
Driftwood has far too many Magisters for my liking. I fell for one of them, not &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of them.
*Beg her to be quiet.*
So little? You can sit and think about your stinginess at leisure... in a prison cell.
...or face the consequences.
Brittle
[LIZARD] *Sneer that you saw plenty of slaves try to bury themselves in worship back in the Ancient Empire. It didn&apos;t help any of them.*
CAWKAWRIKAW! RIKAW! RICAWKAW!
This ancient tome is falling apart at the seams. Much of the scrawled writing is faded with age, but squinting hard, you can decipher most of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The esoteric illustrations describe how to create a variety of elemental scrolls for crafting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though this knowledge is older than your ancestors, it could still prove to be useful for you today.&lt;br&gt;
*Give him a stern look... then smile. Hook a finger towards him: &apos;Come here.&apos;*
Leave me be! &lt;i&gt;I need this!&lt;/i&gt;
Nurse Mi
Tell &apos;im a chap wants to talk. Baran Levere. Black Bull Tavern. First floor.
Use an identifying glass to learn about an unidentified object.
My god took refuge in my soul. I must still find help in expanding my Source powers, then claim Divinity at the Well of Ascension.
*And suddenly you&apos;re engulfed by a sea of memories - every life the entity has consumed, stretching back millenia. Fragments buffet you, gnaw at you, until everything you are is falling away.*
What do you think you&apos;re up to?
The trial is yours to attempt, if you have the will. But beware - the seasons can be cruel to those who underestimate them...
*Leya waves excitedly as you leave.*
A blade through the heart would be a kindness to these lost souls.
*Meistr Siva&apos;s shoulders slump, a tired, melancholic grin on her muzzle.*
*Hold your ground. You won&apos;t give Stingtail up.*
I used to sell recipes in Driftwood. I can do that again. Anything you want.
*Look at the console. There are four buttons. Ask what they do.*
Why don&apos;t you make something of yourself? Go to the Cathedral and take the Path of Blood. If you have it in you.
*Touch the mosaic at her feet.*
Back again, eh?
Your offer insults me![1]
Such a weapon does not discriminate in which lives it takes. Nobody should have it at their disposal.
Fancy Letter
Oh, may the Seven have mercy on their own creation.
As long as I remain, so too do the Seekers.
Dog-Chewed Bones
The experience of a lifetime, is it?
[UNDEAD] *Tell him there are worse fates than death.*
We read of &apos;The Mistake&apos; - a Godwoken trained by Seekers, who&apos;d turned on the Divine Order. The Magisters still hold him captive.
Gravekeeper Farimah implored us to kill Ryker and free his servants.
I know a lot more after your tale. Using the Aeteran to steal the Source from the world? She&apos;s lost her mind.
You&apos;ve a wicked mind. You&apos;ll enjoy this.
Old Lady&apos;s House
Looks like this place has seen better days. MUCH better days...
Can&apos;t forgive it in myself either.
*Shrug and say that you&apos;re a student, you guess.*
Provoked indeed! He &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; Sourcerers lure Voidwoken. And he &lt;i&gt;knows &lt;/i&gt;we&apos;d all still be alive if he hadn&apos;t attacked our caravan.
No, my child. This is the natural way of things. The Source of the Eternals is to be returned to the Eternals.
At least you managed to murder one of the Seven! &lt;i&gt;Quite &lt;/i&gt;the spectacle.
*Tell her that her secret is safe with you.*
Very well. Here&apos;s a little something special.
Wondrous Wraps
Tempting, mate, but no. Got to deliver it myself - the spore might kill me, but disobeying orders &lt;i&gt;definitely &lt;/i&gt;wilL.
Sack
Side with the Sourcerer.
I don&apos;t have the right tool for mining.
And listen: You keep your nose down, why don&apos;t&apos;cha. Stay outta trouble and you may make it out o&apos; here alive.
This will work much better if you close your eyes. Please...
That they were. We don&apos;t burn friends in the street. Nor enemies, for that matter. But these... &lt;i&gt;things...&lt;/i&gt;
*You feel the needle being driven so deeply into the bone that it snaps your neck. All goes dark, forever.*
*The headless statue looms over you. Its praying, decapitated form resembles that of an executed martyr.*
Behaviour
Find the Source weapons.
&lt;i&gt;Demonic&lt;/i&gt;, indeed? Didn&apos;t take long for that particular cat to come out of the bag, now did it?
*Recall the madman who attacked you on the beach and say you may have seen him.*
Still, I&apos;m nothing if not a tolerant man who believes in individual growth. I&apos;m sure the journey taught you much! As such, I&apos;d like to offer you what was denied to you before: the opportunity to become my slave!
To lock someone away for eternity is terrible, but to leave them with no-one but a demon for company? That is unforgivable.
*Tell Kemm to let Arhu go. You need him and you need him alive. Everything depends on it.*
[OUTLAW] *Nod along and encourage the lizard to tell you more about his &lt;i&gt;genius&lt;/i&gt;...*
You will be one, or you will be &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt;. The other gods must bow to you, or be undone!
Of course, this particular kind of disease is invariably fatal, unless one catches it in the early stages. To be frank, you&apos;re not in an early stage at all, but your Godwoken self has managed to keep the darkness at bay.
I know you, Scion. I hear your name. You are our last hope. You are the hope of the elves.
*Describe where you met him, but caution her to be careful; there was something terribly wrong with him.*
Honey
Sparrow
Malady is... unfortunately mistaken. I cannot train you, but I can certainly help you on your path. As long as I am free of this rope.
*Ask what business it is that Lord Kemm went in pursuit of.*
Have it your way then, thug!
