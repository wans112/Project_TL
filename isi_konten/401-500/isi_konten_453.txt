I can feel Source radiating from the golem - we can&apos;t defeat it while it contains such power!
No.
*...into your mouth... forming a tongue... a smooth mass, latching onto the back of your throat... then smooth becomes rough... almost &lt;i&gt;scaly, &lt;/i&gt;and you feel your Source... unsettled, as if attracted to the man&apos;s black eyes...*
*Admit you&apos;ve heard rumours. Ask her if Alexandar &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;do his... you know... in the woods.*
Bottle of Wine
*He belches, then pokes the fish with his milk-white nose.*
*Tell her you&apos;re looking for Gareth. You too are searching for Braccus Rex&apos;s weapons.*
Letter
Saheila&apos;s People
I know.
*As the alcove opens up, you see the same skeleton that you met on the boat before it sank.*
You are no Magister. Haggard look. Haphazard garb. I dare say you fled Fort Joy. The name&apos;s Gareth. And you are...?
Axes
In your case, more than I suspect man, God, or even reptile can provide. However, we must soldier on.
*Reach left and trace a random name. A victim from the past.*
And?
The Doctor is not taking visitors.
*Stingtail writhes in your grip as he gapes at you with fear-smothered eyes, his voice a pitiful wheeze through his tightened throat.*
No, of course you wouldn&apos;t. It&apos;s a written language, unreadable to most... but myself, naturally. It comes from a mysterious race from another world - beings that &lt;i&gt;feed on minds.&lt;/i&gt;
Vignettes
Bark At The Rune: Thunder Rune
*Consume Pavlonia&apos;s Source.*
This skull-shaped pendant provides some magical protection.
Imagine - me completing the ritual of Mord&apos;Akaim. My lord honours me.
A massacre, away from public gaze. Perhaps the dead flesh still holds secrets...
*The figurehead looms ahead, continuing its silent watch over the seas.*
*Ask for him to explain once again how to get past the statue of Lucian at the Path of Blood.*
*Push the button.*
Two birds, one stone. How about it?
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;. The damn recruit. I&apos;d be wining and dining aboard the Lord Dread if it weren&apos;t for you. Your meddling in Magister affairs had better be worth it!
It is time. The Elves need a new Mother. They need you. Take root, Sebille. The Mother demands it of you.
Shall we go?
Enemies around you receive [1]. You receive a status that turns enemies in [2]m radius Blind.
*Ask the lizard what&apos;s so special about this tree.*
Well then. This is, as they say, it.
*Say that you&apos;ve heard a little, but implore him to remind you.*
We must heal the Veil. We must banish the Void forever. We must give up your Source.
I&apos;m not leavin&apos; just yet. Not &apos;til I know who or what is pullin&apos; Mordus&apos; strings - or whose strings he&apos;s pullin&apos;.
Meet me please, prince, at my abode. Ocean view; rag ceiling; carpets of finest sand, oh wondrous, yes. Come talk to me there, Your Highness. They really want you to.
*Wonder what he was asked for in return.*
Wise.
After all, the power of the thing is not the point. It hid something. Who knows what that might have been?
*There are rumours that the symbols were carved by ancient dragon cults, luring in new members to proving trials.*
*Tell her the Mother Tree can live.*
Still, I have full faith in you, Lohse. You&apos;ll find them, and you&apos;ll convince them to teach you.
Frog-woman.
Kept close, this skull ring will lend you the magic bestowed upon it.
Welcome to Four... oh. You again.
Hmm. &apos;Isle of vaults&apos;, yada yadda yadda. &apos;Priest Surrey&apos;, and so on and so forth. Wow - and it even revealed an exact location. I&apos;ll mark it on your map.
Ugh. Why are you still speaking?
&lt;i&gt;Scram! Scram while you can!&lt;/i&gt;
*Invite him to join you aboard your ship, the Lady Vengeance. You could use a fletcher.*
If you&apos;re the same as Verdas, then we have to get you away from this place. Someone&apos;s been killing the few Godwoken that&apos;re out there - likely that dog Alexandar.
Explorer mode
I must take a moment to breathe. Freedom agrees with me!
*Say you certainly understand the gravity of the situation - all the more reason to help her get that demon gone, fast.*
Either you&apos;re very good at guessing or the slightest bit clever. Let&apos;s find out for certain...
Inventory
[JESTER] *Note that she&apos;s someone with a poor understanding of personal space.*
Walking through this world is as repulsively bland as staring at a wall for a century. After a while, the very sight of you disgusts me.
*He points to the fallen Black Ring.*
*You look to your hands, your belly, your feet. Flesh you don&apos;t know, molded into unfamiliar shapes. You cradle your aching head, where another&apos;s memories and wisdoms mix with your own.*
The quality of Godwoken has declined since my time, it seems. Very well - do what you will, to survive.
Conall, the Boastful One
[1] passed [2] onto [3]
*Tell her that you haven&apos;t cleared a path yet.*
Tattered Letter
Rename Player
*Vow you will avenge her death. Whatever is sending these Voidwoken, you&apos;ll put a stop to it.*
Sadha trusted me with one of her eggs. If I cast fire on it, a dragon will be born!
*Your query passes unanswered. She nods to the royal guards, and they point their blades not at Isbeil, but at the queen.*
Whaddya want, reptile?
*Request to hear his royalist song.*
We&apos;re restin&apos; up now. A bit o&apos; sleep and a sip o&apos; drink, and things&apos;ll be as smooth as a troll bbay&apos;s bottom!
But I will find them. Wherever they are, I will find them. We will have our world again.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast, but never claimed the Treasury of the One.
Look at that: a fresh face! And a pretty little kisser it is too!
*Summon the great well of Source within you and cast bless on yourself.*
Attracted by the Source unleashed in the explosion, a gigantic Voidwoken attacked the ship.
...they fear the final snuffing out of light.
*The woman takes you into her arms, pulling you close in a warm, soft embrace. You almost can&apos;t help relaxing as her warmth spreads through you.*
Take Micheil Ros&apos; will.
And I will never again bow to tyranny.
...but I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;you&apos;ll be just fine...
Red Prince! You have returned!
Penny for a grieving beggar whose dog ran away?
You&apos;ve got me close to my snapping point!
A vast continent, full of people. Full of destinies...
A beautiful piece, isn&apos;t it? Have you charged it yet?
*The cat sniffs the fish and wrinkles its nose. It chows down - but it doesn&apos;t look happy about it.*
Heh! That&apos;ll happen here. Hope Griff and his people aren&apos;t givin&apos; you too hard of a time. He and his have it out for anyone who ain&apos;t a human. More and more do these days.
The reward&apos;s whatever I damn well decide it to be! Now clear off unless you know anything useful!
Guards! What&apos;s this elven prisoner doing in here?
Huh. &lt;i&gt;Charming.&lt;/i&gt;
I don&apos;t know you... do I?

Favourable Wind Skillbook
I still owe you my life. When the fighting starts, you can count on me to watch your back.
*...and something blasts right through the warrior&apos;s torso, like he was made of parchment. He topples forward, a gaping hole visible in his back.*
Captain&apos;s Medic
Greetings, my lord. Looking to ease the pain of a decaying world? You&apos;re in the right place. Beers are ordered at the bar, but can I interest you in a nourishing bowl of stew?

What you don&apos;t realise is...
You can learn new skills by finding or buying skillbooks.
What kind of Divine was he, as the Eternals took their place in the world? Did he show mercy? Did he sacrifice others to empower his people? Did he wish he&apos;d given his soul to the Veil, or was he sure he&apos;d done the right thing?
I&apos;m sorry, but you have to go. What if you&apos;ve scared her off? What if she never comes home? Oh Erma...
*He&apos;s assuming an air of levity, but he&apos;s clearly unwell. Ask him what&apos;s wrong.*
*Apologise and back off.*
Oh - would you look at that?
First, you must understand the madness the King unleashed on the world.
Press-ganged
Daylight! There must be an opening nearby.
You... you do not ask. It does not like your questions.
Thank the Divine you&apos;re here to protect us!
*Ask who or what he is.*
*Give him a thumbs up. Boy, he sure showed you!*
*He winks and flips a gold coin toward you. It makes a long, high arc, glinting in the sun, and lands squarely in your hand.*
Amadia&apos;s blessings upon your brave soul!
*He starts to cry.*
Secret Slot
Then it&apos;s time to smarten up. This responsibility isn&apos;t one of the meek, the selfish or, in &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;case, the ignorant.
Pretend to be Almira&apos;s thralls.
Keep back! I found this bounty - it&apos;s mine, and nobody else&apos;s!
*Kill him.*
It is hard to hear of such power, and not covet it for yourself. I lie to myself, and convince myself that I am special. But I am not special. I am dead.
You shall end then.
&apos;Sundries, Oddments, and Generall Miscellany available across the square.&apos;
Ugh, must you? Bad enough they were left like this...
This lever is rusted stuck. It&apos;ll need a lot more strength to force it.
*Say you aren&apos;t sure. You might be mistaken.*
Is there no blessing that will cure us?!
Stop right there, Sourcerer. Friend or foe?
You were the key to it all.
Don&apos;t tarry, my princelings need blood to feed them and bones to grow them...
*This is the heart of the Mother Tree, the centre of the elven universe. It looks... &lt;i&gt;unwell.&lt;/i&gt; The Deathfog device sitting inside it only accentuates the impression of ill health.*
*She bows her head in deference and allows you to leave.*
Not without that fine armour set.
Once she screamed and screamed and I thought she&apos;d never stop. But now it&apos;s done. Her roots don&apos;t quake and my bones don&apos;t clatter. Silence and silence is golden and silence...
Well, you know what I think. We need to find Lucian. Without delay.
*HRR!*
Others as well. Even the God King.
You cannot... defeat me... Godwoken. &lt;i&gt;He... &lt;/i&gt;does not allow it. Rise... my decaying... army! Rise!
It had to be the lower one. Dorian&apos;s a dwarf, after all.
Hey, now where&apos;s that spitfire of a gal I used to know? Used to be we couldn&apos;t keep you still for longer&apos;n two shakes. Now it looks like all the life&apos;s been drained out ya.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell Beast your only enemy is ignorance.*
*He nods and turns away from you with a twist of his lip. He mutters and paces, tapping his chin as he tries to remember.*
*The lizard screeches, slamming her fist against her throne, sending sparks flying. One of the stars above her ignites, wreathing itself in flame, and with a blinding flash, she&apos;s gone.*
&lt;i&gt;Why do you come, dwarf-&lt;/i&gt;breaker? &lt;i&gt;You who hollow the earth but are not of it? We have a vessel already.&lt;/i&gt;
Hope you like what you see.
Hmm. Let&apos;s take a look, shall we?
So much death for nothing. Lucian didn&apos;t stop the Black Ring.
Mask of the Shapeshifter
Goatskin Gloves
*She laughs. The sound fills the air like the ringing of a bell.*
*Tell her you killed Roost. One in your party consumed his flesh, too.*
*Ifan scowls at you, but says nothing further.*
