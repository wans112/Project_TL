*She stares at you blankly, empty sockets seeming to stretch into the farthest reaches of oblivion.*
Spinning Wheel
In eternity&apos;s dream, I have seen you time and again. Time stands still in this moment.
*Your mind races. Could this be true? Could it be &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; who brought death and destruction to the elves? All those lives... who would set you up like that? Not... Lucian? No, Lucian couldn&apos;t... &lt;i&gt;wouldn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;...*
You *are* guilty! Someone, help!
Beware! Playing as an &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Undead&lt;/font&gt; poses unique risks and benefits. Undead must &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;veil&lt;/font&gt; their true selves from the living or risk being attacked. Healing potions and spells will &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;damage&lt;/font&gt; you, while poison &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;heals&lt;/font&gt;. Undead can &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;pick locks&lt;/font&gt; with a bony finger alone and can &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;survive&lt;/font&gt; the scourge of Deathfog.
*Try &apos;dragon&apos;.*
*Tell him you wish to fight the current arena champion.*
*Featherfall hops eagerly onto your shoulder and digs his claws in deep. He pecks your cheek in what could charitably be called an affectionate manner. Blood drips from the wound. At least he didn&apos;t go for your eyes.*
Besides that mad scientist at her side? Hard to say. Isbeil pulls the queen&apos;s strings. No idea who pulls hers.
*Poke him.*
The Last Forest Tiger
Ability Skillbook
*Ask if the magic word is &apos;Arx&apos; or &apos;Lucian&apos;, or possibly &apos;Lucian&apos;s Day&apos;.*
No. I can hear it. Not the echoes, I can hear &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;. The voice. It... it&apos;s here.
Alas, I fear reality calls. We had better get back to the others.
*She glances over her shoulder, checking that no-one can hear her, and whispers to you.*
I&apos;m a humble child of the Divine. No more. My boy Kniles has gone and made something of himself in Fort Joy, but we don&apos;t pretend to be anything but what we are. You&apos;re welcome to drink here, if you like.
Effects unknown
A... A Sourcerer?! I... This can&apos;t be... I need to apprehend you!
*If any doubt remained, it has now been erased: he is a god, all-powerful.*
*The girl&apos;s eyes clear for a moment, but then are swallowed by darkness once more.*
Fine Book
*Tell him it was a pleasure meeting him, but that you really ought to leave.*
My demon became Divine. This should be interesting.
[RED PRINCE] *Scoff and tell her a mightier fire than you hasn&apos;t been born. You&apos;ll demonstrate.*
*Declare that you are no fugitive, and demand to know the source of these lies.*
A bad gig landed me on the wrong side of the Magisters, but how bad can Fort Joy be? If the voice in my head shuts up, I should be okay.
Warning! The savegame has detected tampering or corruption.&lt;br&gt;It is strongly advised that you do not continue on this savegame.
*Tell the other presence to shut up - you want to speak to the girl.*
You clearly have a hard time understanding all this, so let me paint you a picture.
You will see the power he has given me. You will see the majesty!
*A few moments pass. She breathes in and out heavily, then gets back on her feet with all the makeshift dignity she can muster.*
Can&apos;t be sure what I did or didn&apos;t see. I&apos;ve known mirages like this one before, but I&apos;d sooner not speak of any of &apos;em.
Mack The Knife
But they do.
*Karon wishes he could have been more than he was. He wishes he could have been the Creator. But he was the Destroyer, and he embraced destruction, fearing he could be nothing more.*
*Tell her nothing has changed; you care for her, but love isn&apos;t on the table.*
Spirit of a Masked Servant
Before you I moved through this world like a ghost. I tried to see everything while remaining unseen.
Do not mock me. You know what lies beneath. But I will not allow you another step closer. Qanna&apos;s already laid claim to it.
You take care now! The new tenants rigged this place to holy high heaven just after settlin&apos; in. Some folks are very private.
What I wouldn&apos;t give to be able to close my eyes...
Next Level
*Hurry them along. Enough talk.*
Change
*Insist Billy share his profit from your answers with you.*
Brahmos
*Tell him you&apos;re not interested in making pacts with strangers.*
Observing the Roll
*Turn and walk away.*
*Change the colour of the water from black to crystal clear, that he may see his fear.*
I used to like fishing. It relaxed me. Now I have Voidwoken on one side, the wife on the other. It&apos;s just not the same.
We had a little chat a while ago, you and I.
*Reach for the gem.*
Escape the fort? Hah! To what end? To return to your home and lead a Voidwoken straight to those you love?
And neither will I.
*Stand in silence.*
*Offer him your wrist. Your pulse will convince him otherwise.*
Who...who has taken my books? My notes? They were here just a moment ago. Everything was peaceful again!
Yes - yes, definitely. I think. So, team: Ready to roll?
Clothing Colour 1
Turn into an Elf
[1] doubles the effects of food and potions.
And if I&apos;m honest... that&apos;s just fine with me. I&apos;ve seen enough. I&apos;ve heard enough. I haven&apos;t got much space left to fit anything else. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;out.&lt;/i&gt;
UI Map Right
[1] improves the ability to intimidate people during dialogue.
How you have suffered. How much blood you have spilled. To make it this far... it is no small achievement. Especially since...
If a fight is getting the better of you, you can always flee and come back when you&apos;re more prepared.
Delorus thanked us for our help, and went to rejoin his comrades.
HAH! Stupid.
Come here.
*He smirks.*
*Tell the cat that you mean no harm. You just want to try and help.*
*Tell the dog you&apos;re not the one who did this. You&apos;d stop it if you could.*
*Take your leave.*
You&apos;d presume right.
*Tell them you&apos;re done with them.*
*Say that&apos;s not what you meant! Of course you didn&apos;t mean &lt;i&gt;her.&lt;/i&gt; You meant Roost.*
May your reward be as great as your sacrifice...
a spirit
Deal with the dead.
*Shrug. No reason.*
Until then!
[UNDEAD] *Drily remark that you&apos;ve been inflicted with mortal pain before... but not in this case. You&apos;re fine.*
Sister! Help me, please!
*He turns and snarls at you, the expression on his face so vicious you recoil involuntarily. Seeing this, he falters. In an instant, he is a blank slate, devoid of any descernible emotion.*
They&apos;re wrong about me. They were ALWAYS wrong about me.
*Ask if she plans to use the skill from the book you gave her on herself.*
*Your palms prick with sweat and your heart starts to race. Yes, you&apos;re ready.*
*Bloodied and sad, a severed head sits on its stick. Its eyes snap open and dart from you, to the nearest noxious bulb, and back to you again.*
*Grin and say you&apos;re ready to turn his fears into reality.*
Oh, phew! Well, Amadia knows I have days like that.
The result of a blessed union between tomato and hammer.
*The Magister nods towards his hand and you see the skin is midnight black. It seems to undulate, as if worms were squirming through his flesh.*
Well... like I said Mordus is a special guy. A Sourcerer, matter of fact. Maybe even one of the ones Siva&apos;s after.
Believing war between the dwarves and the Order inevitable, Queen Justinia resolved to strike first - and destroy Arx.
Prince of princes, I am humbled and grateful!
*Grunt!* *Squeak!*
Extravagant Ring
You can set the edge panning speed in the Game section of the Options Menu; you can also disable it entirely.
Hatch the egg.
Oh, I see through your shell, dwarf. You want more than booze and brawls.
*Ask what he knows about the Paladins&apos; accusations - treason, heresy... collusion with the Black Ring...*
And I&apos;ve heard of you. You&apos;re what gets some of us out of bed each day. What do you make of that?
*Demand that she tell you the truth, or you&apos;ll have to pry it out by force.*
I need more than that to go on. Now leave me - I have work to carry out.
I&apos;m not so daft as to fall for that trick. You&apos;re under arrest!
*If she&apos;s not fit to be a Paladin, suggest he banish her. No-one needs to die today.*
Yes. The tale of your birth and the love borne to you by the sun will always remain a part of your mythology.
*Reach for your weapon; you cannot allow this ancient evil to live any longer.*
You have set me free!
*As she pushes off of you, she reaches lightly into your pouch. She stands up, straightens herself, and skillfully tucks some of your gold coins into her waistband.*
Lighting
I am sworn to the Covenant... and you too will be far from alive after I face you in the Arena of the One.
I&apos;m not getting in that boat - not yet, at least.
Raaaaawrf!
*Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;dwarf&apos; and &apos;cave&apos;.*
Cycle Stats
Dusty Old Axe
*Her eyes widen in horror and she turns towards the man she loves for help - but he doesn&apos;t know she&apos;s here.*
In Vignette
Look what you can do: You can bless. You can see the spirits of the world. When will you believe that all I want is to see you - to see &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; - succeed?
Small Flame Rune
Staircase to Magister Barracks Chest
...the only problem was that I didn&apos;t have the right gear to dig all the way down. I wasted months trying to dig a tunnel with a bloody spoon.
Plain Amulet
Our sins are legion, beautiful, but they didn&apos;t land us in this dungeon. No, we were fool enough to do the right thing, and try to stop the madness of Braccus Rex.
The Whites are long gone. They could be running right out of the sewers while we stand here gabbing!
Incinerated Seeker
NnnnnnNNNNGH!
No. And neither will you.
You too will bow to death.
*Say you intend to seek ultimate power and ultimate strength - but not for him or his cause.*
Doesn&apos;t seem like the kind of place you&apos;d hide a vault.
*Reply that morality is a river, steered by the impulses of men and women, Gods and Goddesses, chance and nature.*
Rezik
*Inform Gareth you already have a weapon: a wand that can destroy Shriekers.*
*Say you know her, but that she turned out to be rather inhospitable a lady.*
*Appeal to Justinia&apos;s better senses. She is in thrall to Isbeil; Lohar said as much!*
Water
*Wrinkle your nose and state that you have no interest in stealing the rat&apos;s &apos;bounty&apos;.*

My word! I sent you into the dark, but you managed to return? You impress me quite beyond measure.
*The shimmering ghost of a lizard Magister turns her gaze upon you. She holds your stare, boring into your mind, searching the blacks of your eyes for the secrets of your soul... but in so doing she shows you hers.*
Blackring - Normal
*The dog&apos;s spirit rolls his head around, gawking at the ground and sky as if he&apos;s never seen them before, then locks his eyes on yours. He snarls unconvincingly.*
Amadia
I am not falling for your lies. Time to die!
*The pedestal seems empty, as it if once supported something - something powerful; something now missing.*
A great tree stands here, tall and strong!
If that&apos;s all, sir. Roost&apos;s upstairs in the big house. He&apos;s waiting for you.
P... Prince...
*He bursts out laughing, and his guffaws shake the bridge.*
