You want it bad, don&apos;t you? You&apos;re chasing this thing - this label. Maybe you&apos;re trying to save the world. Heh. Maybe you&apos;re just doing it because they tell you to.
Lone Wolf Roost Anlon sold me to my master. I must go to Reaper&apos;s Coast and track the Lone Wolf down.
*Even if it led to his downfall.*

Perhaps the Void corrupted him... maybe his sacrifice was a lie.
Pants of Empathy
The Paladins overthrew the Magisters and ransacked their barracks.
I guess you mean the clown I caught stealing from my kitchen. He&apos;s not going anywhere.
Almira will only help us if we rescue her lover.
I&apos;d never have joined the Magisters if I knew what a pitiful end I&apos;d meet.
*Try to understand what you&apos;ve just seen. It&apos;s as though the spark of life has left her, but here she stands.*
*Inch a little closer.*
A crossbow that looks as though it were carved from solidified shadow. Cold to the touch, it envelops you in misty shade when used.
You lie before this court. You lie to Braccus Rex the just. Every you are closed to yourself. So too the doors.
A Seeker c-can always recognise a Sourcerer when they see one.

Did you get it? Did you get the potion?
*Ask by what means you&apos;ll be able to get out of here.*
*Tell her she&apos;s in for the time of her life.*
*Ask what she needs him for.*

Everyone needs to make a living. I make &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt; running errands.
I - eh - well, that was &lt;i&gt;most &lt;/i&gt;unusual.
Deal [1] damage. Damage is doubled if you are sneaking or invisible. Target is killed instantly if below 20% Vitality.
*Tell him the scar on your face is your best feature. Then tip him a wink and walk away.*
Your mind. The demon that&apos;s in there. As long as it possesses you, divinity will be &lt;i&gt;his,&lt;/i&gt; not yours. You mustn&apos;t give it the chance, Lohse!
But as for &lt;i&gt;using&lt;/i&gt; it, that was all Lucian and Alexandar. I was there when they made the decision. I stood by while they took action. Lucian knew &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;what he was doing.
Blocked by Atrophy.
The impostor is dead... My name is mine once more...
Now. You don&apos;t know yet what I&apos;m about to propose. Take a moment. At least hear me out. And if you&apos;re inclined to respond with violence, well - just know you cannot hurt me in my own home.
They were local boys you killed. Good folk. I wasn&apos;t going to murder innocents.
Even if I believed that... it&apos;s the coldest of comforts...

Captain Arthus,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operation Downfall has commenced, and Her Majesty&apos;s orders are clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My men will make their move when the Peacemaker nears Reaper&apos;s Coast. Trust me: the Divine Order drunkards onboard won&apos;t see it coming. Sail the Victory on my signal - when the bonfire burns, under cover of darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not bother disembarking. We will load the cargo and then return to Driftwood; you only need transport it. And be quick. Her Majesty does not tolerate delays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is time to strike. The rebellion will fall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Lohar

Fashioned to resemble a bird of prey&apos;s talons, these feather-light boots are as soft-footed as they are dangerous.

Not too long ago, I had hoped for the lies to end. I know better now, Godwoken.
You were... &lt;i&gt;reminiscing&lt;/i&gt; about the things you used to do together.
She is gone... she is gone...
I heard something, when I was beneath the waves. Someone&apos;s looking out for us.
Waypoint Shrine
If something weakens the spine of a demon, that &apos;something&apos; is formidable by definition.
But the House of Dreams trades in prophecy. They&apos;ve always known we could be dragons again, for &lt;i&gt;&apos;one day a man and a woman will be born, and their skin will be red, and the fruit of their union will be Great Red Dragons&apos;.&lt;/i&gt;
Ah! Then perhaps my luck has changed. Yes, perhaps this awful business might soon be behind me...
&apos;Here lies Maurinia Grigsby-Barflett.&lt;br&gt;Died wealthy, days after her husband.&lt;br&gt;Aged 21.&apos;
As have I, but not in the ways a &lt;i&gt;true &lt;/i&gt;Godwoken can. Forget those ghastly little jars and wands to which small people must resort.
Just what I&apos;d hoped to hear. And I&apos;ll tell you all about Justinia&apos;s game. I&apos;ll even help you end it. But first - a favour.
That&apos;s a mistake you&apos;ll come to regret.
I&apos;ll make a deal with ya. You cut out the clownin&apos;, and I&apos;ll refrain from slicin&apos; your tongue next time I catch it waggin&apos;.
*Say you had understood that the rules here followed the &apos;finders keepers&apos; school of thought.*
The farms and the fisheries fought to feed the people, against the Voidwoken blight.
Still, I can&apos;t get something out of my head.
*Demand to know why she just brutally killed Stingtail.*
So. We&apos;ve got quite the task on our hands, haven&apos;t we. I have to admit, the whole thing is &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;intriguing.
Lyn and Conway Pryce are safe.
See? Still awake. &lt;i&gt;Always!&lt;/i&gt; We must be vigilant!

Duna damn it all. Deathfog? Is this... is this what Operation Downfall entails? Can&apos;t be. Jus&apos; can&apos;t.
Slumberjack
Wh... what? &lt;i&gt;Destroyed?&lt;/i&gt;
You were called to a world beyond while &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was left standing in some fetid swamp? Have the Seven lost all leave of their senses?!
Even if I knew I wouldn&apos;t tell you! Okay, I&apos;d tell you! But I don&apos;t know! So that answers that!
Back off.
Betrayal, right at the cusp of my destiny...? I stand with you no more.
*Turn him down - you want to talk to her.*
You&apos;ve known each other all your lives through dreams - I watched. You&apos;ve longed for one another in loneliness - I saw. Two flames you were, with a long black shadow cast in between. But soon: no more in between at all.
Dead?! In... incredible! You met Septa with nought but your fleshly carapace to commend you, and you emerged&lt;i&gt; victorious?&lt;/i&gt;

Spoke to the lady captain, didn&apos;t ye? I seen ye, cosying up. Are ye her woman or sail ye with us?
A delicately-perfumed wedding invitation.
*You&apos;re just curious about the camp. What&apos;s going on here?*
You think you can pull the wool over my eyes like that?!
*Source washes over him: a wave over a single flame, but unlike last time, it seems to have precious little effect.*
Damn you. Damn all of you!
*This is it. It&apos;s time to kill the Master.*
*Tell him he should try it.*
*Keep your weapon trained on him and thrust your note in his face. You&apos;re here for answers.*
So ye return.
We gave those powers up freely to create the first Divine, a mortal we infused with our united strength. To bathe in the lake, is to become the Divine.

Ungh... my helmet. It&apos;s getting... tighter...
*As your Source flows into Kinnet, the straws in his hands disappear. He weeps with relief as his wound disappears in turn, and he is restored to the model image of a strapping young soldier.*
Sadha is the secret of my soul. I have no doubt whatsoever we are meant for one another; meant for dragons.
Warning
*Say you have a mission you intend to fulfil.*
Get lost, funny &apos;an. And don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
Trying to buy me off, I see. Well, good. Now, go on with you, before I think better of it.
*Nod. Tell him you&apos;re quite the wizard in the kitchen. A true chef.*

You are the joke if you believe that the Gods will honour their words. You will see!
Ugh. A foul odour.
Come now, it can&apos;t be that hard. How many immortal demonologists are wandering this region of Rivellon, after all?
*Gather your courage and ask about the heirloom you&apos;ve heard about.*
Thinkin&apos; he needs t&apos; change things up. Gettin&apos; tired of hearin&apos; &apos;bout you damned elves.
*Wonder what happened to this place.*
*Tell him the Lone Wolves decide their own business.*
Didja hear about the cat who lost all its money?
Lost a Source Point.
*Wish her a good day and take your leave.*
*Another memory comes into focus. Flashes of light, then overwhelming power. But... it isn&apos;t enough. You will have more. &lt;i&gt;You must.*&lt;/i&gt;
Looks like you&apos;re singing my tune! Now you go your way, and I&apos;ll go mine.

*His eyes meet yours once more. He holds your gaze for a moment, allowing you to see his sadness and pain. Then he turns to look back over the carnage - the aftermath of battle, won at a terrible cost.*
&lt;i&gt;...i am here to tell you the truth... the terrible deep down truth... the inescapable deep down truth...&lt;/i&gt;
We&apos;ve learned that the Seekers are trying to escape the Reaper&apos;s Eye, just like we are. We should find out more about these Seekers whenever the opportunity arises.

Vampirism? As if killing a creature weren&apos;t enough, you should utterly destroy its soul too? A dark skill, but certainly useful.
No way. Ma didn&apos;t leave me; I&apos;m not leaving her.
Don&apos;t toy with me, Sourcerer. You know where she is, and I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; you know it. So talk.

Goodbye, then, lady. I hope I didn&apos;t say anything wrong.
Looks like we&apos;re chiseled from the same stone, Godwoken. You must be so proud.
This empty flask is not much to look at. You have a strange feeling that throwing it far away would improve the aesthetics somewhat; might as well fill it with something first.
Poisoned Pumpkin Soup
More than mere weapons. Traps, purging wands, war wagons - every tool Braccus needed to bend the world to his will.
I guess so. You&apos;re free to go. But just so you know: I watch for you.

That&apos;s one less horror stalking these lands.
Hmm... well that&apos;s... &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; to know.
Sadha knows the Red Prince is near. She wishes to speak with him.
*Say you don&apos;t want to get mixed up in their troubles.*

Sadha made it to the lizard consulate but remains in danger.
Farewell, take care of yourself.
