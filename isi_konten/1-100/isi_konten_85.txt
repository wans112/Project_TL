Of course! Don&apos;t you know the prophecies? &lt;i&gt;&apos;One day a man and a woman will be born, and their skin will be red, and the fruit of their union will be Great Red Dragons.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;d give anything to see her home. But Gareth says we needed her to remove Verdas&apos;s collar, and what Gareth says, this one does.
But to be a master, one must master one&apos;s own kind. Tell me this, have you mastered any Arena?
Certainly! And here I am, all by my lonesome. The &lt;i&gt;other &lt;/i&gt;Godwoken will find one of the Seven hiding out in their souls, you know. Shrivelled, half-dead gods looking to steal Source from their chosen in exchange for the power to see spirits.

Crafting Bible, Part I
I pledge my soul to Lucian, and to his worldly messenger.
*The spirit resists - she bombards you with memories of everything but the dreamers and to where they escaped. Visions of life at the consulate assail you - *
I am &lt;i&gt;better.&lt;/i&gt; I find another thief - and the armour reveals much.
I tell you nothing until I am free. I must return to her. I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt;.
NUHRAAAAAAAAWWWWWGHHHH!
His name wouldn&apos;t mean anything to you. He&apos;s beyond your ken and your claws. You, however, are not beyond &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.
Holy, holy, holy... You oughta thank your lucky stars that thing hasn&apos;t turned you into a meat puppet by now.
Crucifix
I solve my own problems.
Time to wake, sweet prince, and return to the mundanity of dreams once more.
Scorch
Creates Blood surfaces
*Say the operative word here is &apos;phantasmagorical&apos;. This is probably no more than an illusion.*
If you went back to the Ancient Empire, they&apos;d kill you on the spot or put you in shackles and use you for a rent boy! Isn&apos;t that right? Say, why don&apos;t we practice...
An unknown ritual grants access to the Council. We should search the island for clues.
Cleanse Wounds
Dozing Adventurer
Everyone talks a big game when they get here. Big games get smaller when you&apos;ve got one of their weapons in your face, though.
Equal parts savoury, soft, and tempting. Bake to bring it to crispy perfection.
[BARBARIAN] *Tell him he should follow his nature. Be free, and pull what he likes!*
We gave them up freely to create the first Divine. Each of us donated half of that which makes us gods. To bathe in the lake, is to become our chosen.
My word, a Dreamer! But she dreams no more, alas. Just like Stingtail...
Have you seen the things Alexandar has been doing lately? Divine? Nuh-uh.
...they hunt and wander, seeking rotting flesh.
Back to the ship - we&apos;re not needed here.
Village Busy 03
Garrick&apos;s Buried Valuables
&lt;i&gt;*This&lt;/i&gt; is where that Source came from. These poor unfortunates died suffering, that you may be more powerful.*
Soul Gateway
*Better him than you. Consume Kinnet&apos;s Source.*
*Decline her advances.*
*Shake your head. You&apos;re happy enough exactly where you are.*
You&apos;re CAW-close, little Peeper babe. You&apos;ll hatch soon. If only AWK-any of the others were alive to brood you! My poor little Peeper egg...
*Ask how he got involved with the digsite.*
Better not linger. I can&apos;t afford to get frozen in place.
*The time for timidity has passed. Slay Jonathan yourself.*
*He holds the apple to your mouth. It feels not cool and dry, but warm and wet. And more - it tastes of fear.*
*The Hall of Echoes manifests as a crude stone arena. With an impact like an earthquake, the Devourer descends.*
*As you remove the lid, a fresh wind fills the room and power rushes inside you. You can feel Source coursing through your bones.*
*Tell the cub it might be time to consider that its mother isn&apos;t coming back.*
Birds Deep Forest 03
[SOLDIER] *Explain that you&apos;re just here to fight another battle.*
[JESTER] *Volunteer &apos;in his sleevies&apos;.*
Find Gareth.
I&apos;ll need help removing my Source collar.
Champion to the gods, eh? Colour me impressed.
I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t accommodate you with the opportunity to have a word with milord Kemm at this precise moment, sir. Milord left early in the morning in pursuit of business and he hasn&apos;t yet returned.
*No, you wish you could have saved Dallis too. Offer your condolences.*
Do you faint at the sight of blood...?
Go to the crypt. Find Lucian. Say hello to the Doctor. Become the Divine of the light. Easy, right?
Looks like those Black Ring made a lethal enemy...
*Holding her head in her hands, her bones start to fall to the ground, one by one, where they slowly melt to dust. Eventually her mask clangs to the ground, leaving just her robe fluttering in the breeze.*
*This jar glitters and glows. From within you think you can make out the distant sound of laughter.*
Punisher
A striking painting - and featuring some familiar faces.
*A compartment in the side of the contraption appears to be empty - there&apos;s a part missing.*
*She leans toward you, her veiled eyes directed toward the ground. The slightest of smiles plays over her lips, then vanishes.*
*Tell him there&apos;s been a misunderstanding - you have permission from Sister Avenny &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;the Paladin guards!*
*Say you didn&apos;t follow her - you found her by accident.*
*You can feel your thumb slide through his eye as if through a hardboiled egg. A thick mixture of blood and jelly gush down your hand and Stingtail&apos;s face.*
*The spirit takes great pains to ignore you.*
*The tablet is ice cold to the touch. No matter what you do, no further message can be deciphered from it.*
melee
The fisheries returned, and the fertile farmlands produced the greatest harvests the surviving farmers had ever seen.
*Tell her you don&apos;t see any guards around here.*
Barrage
*Reassure her - the Magisters got what they deserved.*
You beastly thing. I abase myself serving a lizard, and you reward me with that filth? Stay away from my bar, you hear? This is a &lt;i&gt;civilised &lt;/i&gt;establishment!
You feel the anticipation of agonising death with every swing of this hefty axe
*Laugh. Fort Joy seems like a lifetime ago.*
Old Ancient Empire Key
Shut up! It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;m talking to.
And when I say always dark, I mean always dark. You&apos;re either in the room or in the box, for it&apos;s in the box that you travel.
*Say that combat has been alright.*
Large healing potion
*Leave him to it.*
[OUTLAW] *Stand firm, but clench your fists in case things go south with this Ifan.*
*Stare at the slain beasts, and comment that they must have been the cause of the shipwreck.*
Sadha is dead.
We aren&apos;t really safe here, are we?
People like you are the reason it must be recovered.
*Slobber drips from the dog&apos;s bared fangs. Where the driblets land, the soil bubbles.*
My own name... A little gift from Tir-Cendelius. Leave it to a god to be overly dramatic.
*You are a Sourcerer, strapped down, your head ringing with agonising pain. You feel strange and cold, immobile on the stone... cold inside... cold at parts of you that should not feel the air.*
*Whisper that he shouldn&apos;t listen. The Void can&apos;t be trusted.*
Tactical Retreat Skillbook
I am consort to Her Royal Highness Justinia. It is my business to know who serves the queen&apos;s allies and abets her enemies. Lizard royalty does not roam this land unnoticed.
Keep your rune stones safe from harm.
*His eyes lock to yours. You see little of the Gareth you&apos;ve known in them. There is no faith, no moral compass - only ire.*
*She looks at you in surprise for a moment, then barks furiously.*
Well, the consequences caught up with him. The consequences of Lucian&apos;s actions caught up with all of us.
Go hence, learn, and do not tarry. The Void grows stronger with every passing hour.
*The chest sits silently for a moment before answering.*
It was absolutely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;.
You cannot even comprehend the master you seek.
Whether a populace pulsing with ceaseless Source can keep the demons confined to their own plane, I can&apos;t yet say. But I think we&apos;ll know soon enough.
Sir, she only -
Oh, I&apos;ll do you one better. I&apos;ll take you there.
Fascinating. So quick to anger. It has the outward appearance of one of our kind, but underneath it is so very primitive...
Raaaaarrrrrgh! &lt;i&gt;ARRRRRRAAAAAAAAARGH!!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you know the perfect way: You&apos;d like to discuss the dragon Slane.*
The enemy of my enemy isn&apos;t always my friend. If I see Alexandar, I&apos;ll be sorely tempted to finish him off, once and for all.
the wireless controller
Move along, eh? Don&apos;t want to get the Atusa treatment myself.
*Slane rears back in eagerness, grasping the Purging Wand with razor-sharp claws. Before your eyes, the Source from within the wand surges into his draconic form, filling him with a light so bright that you must shield your eyes from the glare.*
Saving...
*Ask her what sort of power this is.*
[UNDEAD] *Sympathise. Tricky individuals, those undead...*
*Dryly point out you are no noble.*
Do stop gaping. Anything can be procured inside these walls.
Then... I need wonder no longer...
Undeployed Displacer Trap
Good news, definitely.
Abilities
Until we meet again, Ifan.
You pull that move one more time, and you&apos;ll have more trouble than you can handle.
*Her eyes flick down to your mouth. She smiles coyly, then slinks forward to kiss you.*
Now this is more like it! That barrier could resist the Great Acorn itself.
This collar. It&apos;s choking the life from me.
Bit boring to be so unexceptional all of a sudden, isn&apos;t it?
Easy for you to say, innit? Bet you could punch a Voidwoken and get it to apologise for getting in yer way!
My advice? Leave Arx for fairer ground. No reason to remain.
*Consider what she&apos;s saying. With enough power, you could even replace her...*
The Eternals reclaimed the world.
A cat-shaped whistle.
Keys
You&apos;re still here! Oh joy! The thing under the floor didn&apos;t getcha!
*Calmly suggest she stay quiet. If the Magisters come, you&apos;ll both be in terrible trouble.*
*The state of his boots: point out they look quite travel-worn.*
*His beard twitches as he fights to hide a laugh, but it barks free anyway.*
*She recoils, crying out - but not at you, to someone else... someone who is not here...*
*He smirks and holds the little knife up to the light, watching it glint.*
It&apos;s easier than boiling an egg! Just place a seedling in a bucket and then place it in the ground. The plants know what to do from there!
What? No... no, that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; true. That&apos;s impossible!
I&apos;s dying! &apos;urned alive! Er... undead!
I sense a trapper has been at work here. Take care.
You&apos;ve given me a second life. I won&apos;t soon squander it. Or forget what you&apos;ve done. Thank you.
Elven games. No-one cares!
What happens now?
I wouldn&apos;t imagine the likes of you would know one end of a fish from the other, but I shouldn&apos;t think that&apos;d stop you trying. Good day to you. Don&apos;t let the door hit you on your way out.
Level [1]: +[2]% Magic Armour.
*The two Magisters whistle up their Source Hounds and advance upon you, deadly intent darkening their expressions.*
Brun the Honeybear
*Sigh* Alright. But do mind your manners. For everyone&apos;s sake. Yours in particular.
*Take your leave.*
Belowdecks we found Dallis&apos; stateroom. To enter, we must get past the two doors that bar the way.
UI Select Char4
*Quercus arches his back, almost dislodging Sir Lora, who just smiles.*
The Devourer
Improved Organisation
*Shrug, and turn to other matters.*
Speak with Duna&apos;s Undertaker.
Upon death, heal the wearer of Devourer Armor and reset their cooldowns.
Void Deer
I mean... I never imagined...
This plant has roots of steel.
*Tell him to stop stalling and come right out with it.*
