Umbral Link
Witch Despawn
You should know, I&apos;ll take no pleasure in killing you.
*Ask what he&apos;s going to do now.*
*Nod tentatively and ask to cross the bridge.*
Take the head of Mummie Dearest the Lone Wolf.
And lemme tell ya, runt, by the looks of ya, I ain&apos;t got no reason to stop believin&apos; her now.
Ruphus! Am I dreaming? How could we be together after -
*Nod and tell him to follow you.*
It&apos;s getting *gasp* tighter! I can... I can hardly breathe!
I admire your will. But I am the best chance the Paladins have of learning something from this witch. I won&apos;t rest until she speaks truth.
Hm.
Take on the Black Ring.
*She gives you a quick peck on the cheek and off she goes.*
&lt;i&gt;&apos;...sorrow...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Elk
[IFAN] *Tell her you&apos;ve got to follow up on a very special contract.*
This is Dallis&apos; ship, but she can&apos;t have been the only one who could get it moving. It&apos;d be too risky - and Dallis is anything but careless.
Take the wheel! We sail from Reaper&apos;s Coast!
Here in the underground darkness, Wulfrum heard voices in his sleep. His helpers were fearful. We should stay alert.
Look, by all means, but do not come close to the merchandise. Foul breath may taint even the least delicate of my herbs and tinctures.
You can keep asking, Kemm. I&apos;ll keep telling you to go to hell.
The implication being we are equals, I assume? I no longer a prince; you no longer a slave?
P... peep...
*Agree to help him and break his Soul Jar.*
Drudanae Pipe
Increase the range of a target character&apos;s ranged attacks and skills by 4m.
Ever tell you I worked with Lucian? Fact is, I was once pretty high up in &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; Divine Order. He was... a good man.
Well, &lt;i&gt;rav&lt;/i&gt;. At some point, long ago, I decided poetry had but two purposes: to quicken the peoples&apos; river of tears, or to stave them.
Thank the Gods you&apos;re alive! Hurry, let&apos;s find the others.
The ghost of Brother Kalvin, jailer to a possessed dwarf, told us that to exorcise the demon we must torture the dwarf.
Rat Form
*CHT!*
That&apos;s just not the kind of business I&apos;m interested in anymore...
*You&apos;re intrigued. Ask for more details on the reward.*
It&apos;ll be alright. I&apos;m so close now. So close to getting it gone for good.
Leather Drop
*Tell him that you&apos;re fairly sure the Divine Order are not on your side.*
[JESTER] *Say of course! Does a bear... you know... in the woods?*
*Raise an eyebrow. Rather cowardly to put such responsibility on your shoulders if all you did was go into hypotheticals.*
Thing is, I forfeit my hand. That&apos;s right. I&apos;ll tell you where your Master is. Just like that.
*Divinity has eluded you so far, but humanity - humanity beats strong within you, here and now.*
I figure I find something unusual, but no such luck.
It made her into a monster. She was already prone to brutality, but the voice of the Devourer bid her to rip soul from flesh.
Pity.
[1] was hanged.
Mind yer manners &apos;round Griff, eh?
The staring hollow eyeholes of this rusted helm seem to penetrate your very soul.
Victory! The artefact is yours!
*Assure her you&apos;re far from a &apos;misguided dear.&apos;*
*Shrug. It all depends on who the Magister wanted Ifan to kill...*
*Tell her you thought she was someone else, and step away.*
*He walks over to you with slow, smooth steps, his staff clicking sharply against the stone.*
*Laugh and say that you&apos;re not here to let an insane man loose.*
It&apos;s a mistake I can never make up for, and one I&apos;ll never make again.
*Tell him to fight his own battles.*
Once all are well once more we take the mill.
Sebille killed the Mother Tree and freed the elves from their subjugation.
Yes! Sourcerers. Bad! Kill! But... Master. Nice. Rub. Food. Friend.
Although it seems you already have quite a pack of travelling companions.
Create a magical field that restores Magic and Physical Armour and increases elemental resistances on allies in an area.
Best let me handle this.
*Ask if she can remove your Source collar.*
You must realise, Beast, that our fates are now as one, just as our souls are now as one. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; are &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;.
I&apos;m in no mood for these silly games!
Unsheathe
Well, unless you count... never mind. So. Malady says you&apos;re like me. A... a...
Huh? Wut? Oh. Hi. Soooooo... yeah. Hey, here&apos;s a thing: don&apos;t get too close to the sticky-out thing with the shape thing near the door. Thing&apos;s dangerous. What a shock! Uh... bye.
[LOHSE] *You watch Alexandar in disbelief. You have the sinking feeling that the thing inside you is watching, too.*
Not nasty, no! There&apos;s &apos;retty stuff in the chest. &apos;eautiful stuff! O&apos;en the chest and find out!
Breathe flames in a cone, dealing [1] and leaving fire surface behind.
Where is it, where is it! Madam! Please, have you seen a small, burlap pouch lying about?
Oh hi!
*Tell him you need the money to cover your expenses - gear and bribes.*
Krylr the Kettlegrinder
Ah, yeah. Yup. It was a shipwreck alright... Not much more to say about it, I guess. Papa Joris used to tell me &apos;Lohse!&apos; he&apos;d say &apos;Lohse, you ever find yourself in a sinking ship, follow the rats. They&apos;ll find you a way out.&apos;
*He hands you a damp scroll. In between the fish guts it seems to give details of how to cast a powerful Source spell.*
Hnr!
*Pause. Enslaving the ship seems - immoral, somehow. It isn&apos;t right.*
Sourcerer&apos;s been wandering through the Blackpits, infecting the place with Voidwoken. And these murderers - these &lt;i&gt;traitors&lt;/i&gt; - sheltered him. Clothed him. &lt;i&gt;Fed &lt;/i&gt;him.
Damian&apos;s bones, where is he hiding?
*Alexandar has plans for you; Siva has plans for Gareth. As you watch the newly anointed Seeker walk away, you know you mustn&apos;t mourn for long. Your commitment is to the Magisters. Without Gareth, they are all you have.*
Bah! Rudely am I denied! You may break my heart, but I&apos;ll have yours with strawberries!
*Ask how she and Amyro came to Fort Joy.*
*Ask him what&apos;s happened here. He doesn&apos;t seem well.*
From a scrap of a diary, we learned that the vaults have failsafe measures where the levers to each vault door chain be broken, should the demons within manage to escape their chains.
*Maintain a stony silence.*
Think of it this way: you&apos;re not being robbed, you&apos;re making a generous donation to help support your own kind.
Wits
*He smiles brightly and pulls you in for a short, if warm embrace.*
I&apos;m told Justinia came to express her best wishes to the bride and her father. Whether the queen&apos;s still inside after all the commotion, I can&apos;t say. It seems the Void sent some uninvited guests...
Alright, lass. Colour me convinced. Excited, even...
*Say that you don&apos;t think you&apos;ve spoken to his son - he&apos;s an artist?*
Ryker&apos;s Rest  - Upper Floor
*After a quick back and forth the squirrel throws up its paws and reaches out to touch your foot.*
Tanzanite
*Tell her she should be true to the woman she is. The present is all that matters.*
*The dwarf&apos;s shoulders sag in relief when he sees you.*
*The wood groans and creaks. For a moment, you swear a face appears in the wood. A face tortured and tormented, a six-sided shape carved upon its forehead.*
*Crack open your rucksack; you&apos;ll have a look.*
Apparently you didn&apos;t hit hard enough.
Class Selection
All is well that can be well. Enjoy the freedom of the breeze upon you. For now.
*Ignore the guard, lunge for the lever, and yank it downwards.*
Sovereign&apos;s Orb
We found a strange skeletal arm on the coast. It&apos;s waving to get our attention.
*Tell her to quit fooling around. You want to talk.*
[1] gives you +[2]% maximum Vitality and +[3]% Dodging.
Cave In
Wasn&apos;t easy, I know.
*Lohse&apos;s eyes are ink-black, her skin corpse-grey; her chest heaves in rapid pulses as she stares intently at Jahan.*
*She quails at your touch, shrinking back from you.*
*Take the red fish.*
Silence! Do not interrupt the trial.
*In the span of just a few seconds, panic crosses his face, then sadness, then numbness.*
You hear me, now. You get out of this place. You keep fighting. You become the One. And you think of ol&apos; Nebora when it&apos;s all over.
*And? What are you supposed to do about it?*
And what kind of Divine was the Red Prince, as the world battled the demons?
Enjoy your freedom while you can, lizard. Your day is coming. Oh yes, it&apos;s coming alright. Good day.
And to you. And to you!
*The spirit opens his arms to embrace you, but he dissipates as he nears you. Another adventure awaits him.*
Fair enough. I shan&apos;t pretend I don&apos;t feel the same.
Big Chicken Foot
These questions won&apos;t let me rest. To be a loyal soldier for so long, then... then treated like that.
*Tell him you&apos;ll take the key right now, if it&apos;s all the same to him.*
We don&apos;t know from whence these beasts came, but we do know Source calls them.
[LIZARD] *Ask if Griff won&apos;t be angry to see her selling to a lizard.*
Beneath the smell of rotten meat and scab of yellow filth, it appears to be made of ivory.
You got anymore songs in ya? This savage Beast could use some soothin&apos;!
Why slaughter these people like this...?
*Wonder aloud what he did to deserve such a punishment.*
[ELF] *Hold your tongue. You know not this Sarias.*
*You don&apos;t need to be told twice. Undress.*
Heavens. There&apos;s not enough tea in Rivellon to put out a blaze that hot.
I let Lovrik off the hook.
Audrey...
*The dog just lies there, still in pain.*
It&apos;s a rather &lt;i&gt;strong &lt;/i&gt;presence. Hard to miss.
As you so rightfully point out, milady, &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; unlike a butler.
Ai! Ai! Ai!
Glurgh...
Spider Legs Skillbook
I pledge my soil to you, O Lucian. Please return.
*Say you don&apos;t know what - he? - means.*
*Tell him he&apos;s a funny one. He&apos;s picked a golden jester.*
Away with yeh!
*Say it felt great. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;free &lt;/i&gt;now.*
I bet it tastes like you.
*You suddenly hear something in the distance. A familiar tune. It&apos;s your scar song...*
Walk on, bones. I got nothing to say to you.
*Ahem* Juicy little roundlings, aren&apos;t they. Yes indeed, they are!
Since my emancipation, I have sought clues of what happened to my people. In those caves, I may find answers.
The Paladins are no longer a problem.
Harrowblade
*You grin broadly. You were wondering when they were going to ask for help.*
Coy? Why, I don&apos;t know what you mean! I&apos;m as transparent as the spring sea.
Please tell me that my dear sister equipped you well with Sourcerous Sundries?
Then... there&apos;s nothing left here for us. The Magisters will come back - evil always returns if it doesn&apos;t get its way.
I&apos;m in rather good spirits after that invigorating fight, so I think I&apos;ll return the compliment:
*Claim that the Magisters already know - she&apos;s surrounded. You&apos;re here to try and take her alive.*
*He scans the death strewn at his feet.*
Huh? Oh. You look thiz - thurs - thirsty.
*He pauses, then continues to hum, all the while working his whiskers.*
Truth be told, I&apos;ve had a lot of bad adventures in love. But I keep looking...
*Wonder what he&apos;s heard about you.*
But why seek to be rid of it, when it is a badge of honour?
The Empire used the war to expand its territory.
Not even if the waves bring you home? Out of Fort Joy? Away from Magisters?
