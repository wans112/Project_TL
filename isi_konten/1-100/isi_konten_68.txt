*Ask why he wants to know.*
[NOBLE] *Think to yourself that this Alexandar seems the type to roll over for a compliment. Could be worth remembering.*
Oh, you can&apos;t tell me you&apos;re not judgin&apos;. Puttin&apos; &apos;em in little boxes in that head of yours. I do it. You do it. And let me tell you somethin&apos;...
Hand it over, and righted will a great wrong be.
Finally I found her... Finally I found her only to lose her again.
*Ask what she needs it for.*
And what kind of Divine led the fight, as the world battled on?
[RED PRINCE] *Without a word, in absolute privacy, let her know you too have much to weep about.*
What would he have to gain by killing me? I need to keep my guard up...
Spirit of Trader Liam

This monster is &lt;i&gt;huge.&lt;/i&gt;
Give me back my ring or walk on, stranger. You and your Voidwoken are scarin&apos; the fish.
*A skeletal hand reaches through, package in hand. &apos;Cheers, Zaleskar, old mate!&apos; you say. &apos;The Lone Wolves provide,&apos; comes the dry-voiced reply.*

*mm-mm* ten spans up *hmmmmm*
I don&apos;t trust those Paladins an inch - they don&apos;t give a damn about common folk. I hope the Magisters return soon.

*Shrug your shoulders and follow your dwarven companion.*
*The hunger dies away. For now.*
Windego

Oinks and Odes: A Celebration
Hush!
*Say she should probably start saying her goodbyes.*
*Ask the ghost what it knows about the missing Magisters.*
*Tell him you will not forsake your companions. You &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;find a way to work together.*
There is safety only in silence. I&apos;ve... nothing more to say.
It is not right that such a creature has fallen. They are the princes of creation, greater than any of us could hope to be.

Love...
*Say you can&apos;t imagine doing such a thing. The only thing you&apos;ve ever stolen is another&apos;s heart.*
*His laughter turns into a scream - *

Of course you can. You&apos;re the light of my life. I worship you as it is.
[SCHOLAR] *Ask if she means an impish pocket realm. You&apos;ve heard of them, but doubted their existence.*
Tarquin scoffed at the idea of the Aeteran. No one artefact could purge the world. He quickly shut the conversation down.
Did the, uh, the &lt;i&gt;tree &lt;/i&gt;have a message for me?
You! Daughter of Tenax! Has King Thoran come to liberate this isle? Braccus always feared him - he always feared dwarvish might! Oh, blessed day...!
A thief &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;a liar? I&apos;ll see you rot, scum.
Only
I must confess, your knowledge is impressive.

With the rise of Adramahlihk, Demon Divine, Lohse could no longer resist.
Indeed. Then I say death is the only proper punishment!

*Demand to know who his lord is.*
Give me your body and soul. Now, before the others come. There can be only one now. &lt;i&gt;Give yourself to me.&lt;/i&gt;
*She lifts your veil. Her eyes widen and her lips make a perfect &apos;o&apos;.*
*Say you saw how he died, at the hands of his apprentice. Ask if Garvan is the culprit.*
So will you help us?

Find out how to control the ship.
There&apos;s only one right answer here: Snuff the candles. The spirit will be lost, but the demon will be weakened.
*Lohse turns to you.*
Dunno if you could tell, but mysticism&apos;s kinda my specialty. Let&apos;s get into the nitty gritty, while we&apos;re at it. What sort of magic are you interested in?
*You agree. You always did find history a little tedious.*
*Step away.*
Thanks to green thumbs or black magic, this vegetal creature has become Overgrown, which increases its damage and restores [1] per turn. Removed by &apos;Cursed&apos; status or Necrofire.
*Refuse once more.*
*She nudges you away with the back of her hand. The time for talk is clearly over.*
And I see so many victims of your actions, Ifan ben-Mezd. Yes, I know who you are. You did not know what you were doing, but still. All actions have consequences. And your actions were grave indeed.
*Thank her for the tip.*
I haaaaaaaate this cage. I hate it!
*Ask if it isn&apos;t obvious - someone came in search of something and trashed the place. It wasn&apos;t you, though.*

The question of Divinity is resolved, for better or worse.
*Announce that his God is here. Maybe he could - you know - say hi?*
I see you in my wondrous, foggy fantasies, Sire. They speak to me. They say that you are the one that will bring about the &lt;i&gt;Change...&lt;/i&gt;
With every piece, they grow clearer - and they show me things.
I swear, if I never face another undead it&apos;ll be too soon. They give me the creeps...
Now&apos;s your chance. Just wander up the path there. But I sincerely suggest you don&apos;t do that. If you like living.
*Join your voice with his and follow it to a crescendo.*
*Say that it&apos;s over: Lohar is dead. You haven&apos;t any evidence though because you ate his head.*

Ah. It&apos;s nothing really, it&apos;s just... I&apos;m just a bit... well, a bit &lt;i&gt;hospitable&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell her you&apos;ve cared about her from the moment you met her, forever ago on that ship. You didn&apos;t leave her then, and you aren&apos;t going to leave her now - but she has to trust &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;to ascend.*
...they&apos;re doin&apos; the same to you.
Physical Concentration
*A firm handshake and he&apos;s off.*
The Void. It is not just coming. &lt;i&gt;It has arrived. &lt;/i&gt;It delivered this vision to me - a threat, a promise. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;must stop it.
*She shivers and whispers.*
*He searches your face for a trick. Doesn&apos;t seem to find one. Yet.*
What a disgusting smell.
*Feign confusion and claim you were here last night; doesn&apos;t he remember you?*
Micheil Ros&apos; Estate
*She reaches out and gently lays a hand on your neck.*
I don&apos;t make promises I don&apos;t intend to keep.
HA! Ask me a real question, why don&apos;t you? The answer is Hubert Oak of course - my near-namesake. A question for you - in what year did Lucian the Divine depart from us?
I can grant you majesty beyond compare. Go the land without a name. Find the mark of the dragon worshippers.
Snakeroot
*The object speaks once more, and you consider your fortune in understanding its demonic monologue.*
I miss it. I miss &lt;i&gt;them.&lt;/i&gt; They&apos;ve been forever understanding of my duty. But I admit... I&apos;ve been neglectful. I have some wrongs to right.
Meat Abomination
Deactivate the unstable core.
*Good. Tell her you want to get started as quickly as possible.*
Good luck to you... but please - I need to get back to work.

*Tell her Lohar sent you. You&apos;re a friend. She can trust you.*
...
*Ask if he has ever heard of the Aeteran.*
You &lt;i&gt;had &lt;/i&gt;to push me, didn&apos;t you.
Oh. I do not cover my eyes. I cover the place they used to be. They are gone now. Taken. But I see all the same.
*The elven priest prays on...*
Move Character&lt;br&gt;[1] - Selector Mode

*Shrug. Fair enough.*
We came across Magister in the Blackpits wearing a chestpiece that had rooted itself to him.
*Ask what comes next for him.*
Here for the fight?
