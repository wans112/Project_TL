You&apos;ve summoned the great Prophet Patryk. I counseled Braccus before I knew his madness.
Her Majesty is trying to do what&apos;s best for the dwarf people, and there&apos;s not a thing more you need to know.
Amphibian Leap
Deal with the monster.
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for White Magisters. Ask why there are none in the barracks.*
You&apos;ve no reason to fear me, darling. I could never hurt you.
*The Doctor turns to your companion after the late Divine falls, lifts a vial of marrow, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*
Spirit of Windego
I must be burned - it&apos;s the &lt;i&gt;only way! &lt;/i&gt;Burn me!
Hello again. You&apos;re looking even worse than usual, I must say. Nice to see you found something useful to do at the head of this rag-tag bunch of degenerates.
*Dorotya sees you and heaves a shuddering sigh. She bites into her lower lip with enough force that a drop of blood seeps out - blood, and something else. Something green.*
*These are the dissonant notes of a curse. If you wish to open the chest, the barrier must be destroyed first.*
*The Eternal&apos;s gaze never flicks to you as you turn and walk away.*
*Tell the elf to get lost; you&apos;ll go see the Doctor if and when you&apos;re good and ready.*
We don&apos;t have much yet, but we will tear down every brick until we find their wretched hiding hole. And then we&apos;ll haul Dallis into the light.
But carry this message, traitors. Tell your friends. Tell your neighbours. Tell them all about your fallen angels. Tell them what happens when you defy the will of the Order.
With poisoned Rivellon fries at the ready, you&apos;ll have more dead friends than the man with many poisoned cheeses.
Terrorbite
Are you sure it will work? How d-do I know it won&apos;t make this even worse??
*Gasping for air, he gropes for his pouch of gold and hands it over.*
Tir-Cendelius, hear my prayer. Show us the way forward. Deliver us from peril...
As the world prospered, the number of spirits available to serve him would dwindle.
This egg was born of fire itself - it&apos;s earned its place in this world. Keep it safe, I say.
Unrepentant, Alexandar told Ifan that Lucian&apos;s Deathfog attack on the elves was deliberate. The Divine tricked Ifan into genocide!
Of course I can&apos;t, you dolt. He&apos;s out there, in the marshes beyond the fort.
Honestly... I&apos;m not sure what to think about you. One minute you&apos;re fantastic! And the next, I want to knock some sense into you with a many-pronged cudgel.
I am yours to command, mistress.
But this? To bring us to the land of the dead? This is beyond my comprehension. She truly is a... demon.
Come play with me, Ifan. Come die with me.
Snuffing these candles is an act of mercy. No more will a demon feed upon these spirits&apos; souls.
Hm. Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm. &lt;i&gt;Interesting&lt;/i&gt;.
*She looks around theatrically to see if there&apos;s anyone listening.*
Yeah, whaddya want?
*Ask how she feels, as a kin, about her man fighting against the Empire.*
*She takes a hold of your arm to restrain you.*
[ELF] *Bow. It would be your honour to aid a Scion.*
[LIZARD] *Scold him. This would never happen back home in the Ancient Empire.*
[1]% chance to turn water and blood surfaces and clouds into poison
Sadha entrusted Red Prince with one of her eggs. If one casts fire on it, a dragon will be born!
I&apos;m going to eat it.
*Answer cautiously - the King thinks it&apos;s dangerous. He says that if a veil has been created to hold something back, perhaps there is a reason for it.*
*As he howls his anger free, you hear the echoing howl of his trusty soulwolf. Together, they roar in tandem: grief, loss, and rage. When Ifan is howled hoarse, you feel his anger slink away, like a whipped cur. Yet his soulwolf remains.*
*Say that you and your compatriots have seized this ship from the Magisters, and demand to know who he is.*
In time, the great city, memorial to Lucian the Divine,
*The creature resumes its militant pose.*
*Motion to the shielded cell. What is all this?*
We learned from the elf&apos;s flesh memory that she was trying to grow a set of armour from poisonous spores.
*Your whispered blessing slithers up the tree, cutting the heavy, dark vines that hold Amadia in place.*
Yes. Now get out of my face.
The Great Acorn would stop you all. For good.
You there. Lizard. I&apos;m looking for an inmate. A smallish man, thick spectacles, prone to... somewhat eccentric chatter. He wears a large bronze pendant with a dragon stamped into it.
You? Godwoken? That seems... unlikely. Never mind - there are more important matters at hand...
*Shrug and back away.*
Death
It&apos;s good to be back with my comrades again. I thought I was done for.
Cat and Dog
I am &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; of the opinion however, that this man was to be believed. Was he prince? Maybe. Did he truly work for the good of our empire? Perhaps.
*Tell him the Sallow Man has sent you to kill Alexandar.*
*Hold your breath and cling to the rope for dear life.*
*A sage old dwarf holds his own innards in his hands with bloody bemusement.*
The dragon&apos;s dream sleeps within the armour. I can lead you to this dream to destroy the Devourer&apos;s essence.
Civilians - Tough
*Mention that Verdas seemed to recognise you as &apos;the same as him&apos; - does he know what that might mean...?*
*The smoke envelops the Djinn completely before slinking back into the lamp&apos;s spout, leaving you alone with a silent, inert lamp.*
Plate Leg Armour
He had t&apos;leave somethin&apos; behind, yeah?
*Look about the empty deck. Ask her what happened to the others.*
*Ask if after all that&apos;s happened, she can truly let go of the darkness.*
*She grabs you by the back of the neck to pull you in for a kiss, and as she does so, her other hand slides down in between your legs.*
White Tea
I belong to no-one, and you, strange voice, are the one who&apos;s lost.
...of course. You sang the song - now I am yours. We may sail whenever you wish.
Is it not enough for them to curse you with their faces? Must they inflict them on stone too?
*Tell her that Mordus was controlling her, but he&apos;s dead now.*
*Tell him that against a man of matter and substance, you wouldn&apos;t have been caught off-guard.*
*Chuckle. She&apos;s a cold-blooded killer! You didn&apos;t think she had it in her.*
...greetings.
I appreciate the effort in gaining the respect of one&apos;s fellow refugees. You have my attention, Godwoken, if not my adulation.
*Play along. Go down on bony knee and bow to her.*
Yeah, well the joke&apos;s on you, &apos;cause some scumbucket&apos;s gone and stolen my purse. So go on, get lost. You&apos;re not making my day any better.
*The silent spirit sways gently to and fro - an ephemeral lily in a peaceful breeze.*
Marg the troll is dead. Grog will be happy. Or at least less grumpy.
Whatever you want, just... leave me out of it, lizard. I don&apos;t want any trouble.
In the inner vault we found Rajjarima, a possessed lizard. She claimed to be Godwoken, destined to be Divine.
Mouse Motion
As for me...
*His lip quivers. You expect him to be afraid... but he&apos;s not. He&apos;s &lt;i&gt;ashamed.*&lt;/i&gt;
What is your problem?
*Tell her you&apos;ve asked yourself the same question. All we can do is try, and see...*
I too wonder why, you know, for look what a sadist you&apos;ve become. What a wonderful killer...
Verdas
*The prince narrows his eyes at you, each one glittering in the light.*
The hunt is on!
*The beast has a wild look in its eye; it seems tense and bristles at the sight of you.*
I&apos;ll do me duty, I will, I&apos;ll ring the bell forever more. Forever, Cap&apos;n! Forever! Can you hear it, Cap&apos;n? Rocks ahead, Cap&apos;n! Turn the wheel, Cap&apos;n! Hahahahahahaha! TURN THE WHEEL!
I&apos;m a Paladin of course! My, you must have been here a long time if you don&apos;t recall what the Divine Order&apos;s finest look like.
Apportation Skillbook
The world is mine. There&apos;s just a small detail I need to work out...
*Ask what she is doing in this place.*
*Confirm and say you&apos;ve made some unlikely friends.*
Host
[UNDEAD] *No-one, you say, is livelier lying down than the undead.*
*Leave the lamp where it is.*
*Your voice catches somewhere deep within; it doesn&apos;t reach your throat.*
Hmmm? What? You be needin&apos; something from me, lass? Ain&apos;t much inclined to rub elbows with elves if you catch my drift.
Rich Elf Citizen
You chose a poor place to stick your nose into.
Very well. Embrace thy fate.
You really brought some mess into my life... and I&apos;ve loved it. And &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
You&apos;re still here. Still mewling.
*Tell her she&apos;s a sorry sight indeed. You wish her all the best.*
I don&apos;t rightly know. This was the Source King&apos;s way. Befriend you, then destroy you. I was a fool to expect I&apos;d be an exception.
To the Temple of Amadia
*Note that she seems to be in some pain - was she injured during the taking of the ship?*
Magical Two-Handed Wooden Axe
*The man glowers from under his hood. You can&apos;t see his eyes, but you know they are trained on you.*
I am! I&apos;m a good dog!
Look out for the child who went swimming.
Involuntary death assistant projectiles spent!
*Tell her you&apos;ve seen better fighters than her laid low by hubris.*
*Nod solemnly and tell her you&apos;re sorry for her loss.*
*Reveal yourself as a Sourcerer. Did he know you could banish him to the Void if you wanted?*
Civilian
*You listen to the whisper inside you. It&apos;s so quiet you can hardly hear it. Ask Saheila what it is.*
Single Player
Actually, I&apos;ve never looked better.
We have all the evidence we need. There will be no court of appeal for this Sourcerer.
*Take your leave.*
*Panic flashes across his face and his voice constricts into a harsh whisper.*
Decomposing Terramancer&apos;s Belt
The world as we know it will soon come to an end, and welcome a demon-ridden wasteland in its stead.
You&apos;ve been making quite the mess. And I&apos;m afraid I have no patience for vandals.
Are you sure you want to reset the keybindings to the default settings?
Bloom of Momentum
Stop the Black Ring flooding the temple.
[ELF] *Say that memories of the past are precious to your people. At least they were, until your homelands were destroyed...*
Gold Necklace
*Nod and ask who she is.*
There&apos;s no time to waste.
Nothing. He must be here somewhere...
I pray it helps. Voidwoken at one gate and the Black Ring at the other? We need to stop to this madness.
We told Julian we ate Lohar&apos;s head. He didn&apos;t buy our story.
He cannot do it... we cannot let him...
*Tell him you aren&apos;t interested in his plan.*
Kikiki-ki-ki-kuk...kuk...kuk...&lt;i&gt;kuh!&lt;/i&gt;
*He rubs his jaw in thought and gives you a long look.*
Business Rivals
My, my, look what the ship&apos;s cat dragged in!
What do ya know? The Beast o&apos; the Sea isn&apos;t much like the one in the songs. Turns out you held on to your soul after all.
Consider me to be a final gift - from Malady. My wood was splintered and Malady defeated. But our spirits were intact. In death, she sacrificed her own essence so that I would be whole again, in time.
*Say that the Covenant demands you claim the powers for the God King.*
pin
*Ask if she can see who - or what - is inside you.*
Owlmistress Aoife
*Say you&apos;re not very clear about what&apos;s going on.*
