Entrusted to one person, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a force for good.
Dream Realm
Hiding. Protecting my children. Protecting...
And so it is done. You, the god of light. I, the god of dark. Balance. We should be proud of what we&apos;ve accomplished, Lohse - and all that&apos;s yet to come.
*Gareth&apos;s brows furrow. His thoughts are many, but he&apos;s clearly unwilling to share even one.*
The best... I don&apos;t think that really means anything anymore...
A beautiful day, isn&apos;t it? A &lt;i&gt;most &lt;/i&gt;beautiful day.
Set Chilled on enemies around you and deal [1]. Freeze all susceptible surfaces.
Enter the shop at your leisure.
*Say you were talking about, well, who you&apos;re talking to.*
&lt;i&gt;Dallis&apos; reasons weren&apos;t mine to question. All that ever mattered to me was peace - peace for Rivellon, peace for me, whatever the means. And now, we are on the precipice.&lt;/i&gt;
But not just yet.
Leave? You stand between us the door to freedom. Pray friend, why would we let you leave?
And a wonderful conversation it was! I never would have guessed you knew so much about the history of our world. You must know your Cranley Huwbert by heart.

*The spirits around you bow, showing their respects one by one.*
We found the Surrey family crypt. Johanna Surrey&apos;s tomb should lie within.
Waypoints
Legend holds that these mushrooms are the eyeballs of the dead, poking up from the earth to see what they are missing in their graves.
*Assent: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Contract? What contract?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Umm, well... &apos;Elves eat people and their pets; elves don&apos;t know the alphabet.&apos;
*Tell the kid to run along and play by himself.*
*The book is halfway out when he feels the squeeze of your hand and pauses. After a moment&apos;s hesitation he smiles, returning the notebook to his robes.*
This must be the Dreamer Stingtail was babbling about. She dreams no more, alas.
But the vision always fades! I am just a remnant of the Empress&apos; ambition.
It looks like we have more of the same before us now...
Why do you think? Why do we &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; do any of the ridiculous stuff we do? It&apos;s for a contract.
*Whisper &apos;please&apos;.*
I will be your surgeon, but it will prove to be a difficult operation, for the worm in your heart is none other than Adramahlihk.
Restore Vitality of a target character. Restoration also cures Poisoned, Bleeding.
Okay! I love being all sneaky and sh... uh, well. Yeah. But you better believe the bill for &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;will be a doozy!
I won&apos;t coerce you. Speak to Thorn if you change your mind.
Heh. Cheek, hand, and bottom too. Let Queen Justinia plant a big ol&apos; smooch on all three.
*Nods.*
*Say you understood you&apos;re meant to grow your powers, but you&apos;re not entirely sure where to start.*
*Ask her if she feels responsible for the carnage at Paradise Downs.*
*Give in. If this is how it&apos;s supposed to end, then this is how it ends.*
*Tell her you were just admiring the egg-child.*
*She mumbles to herself. Something about &apos;idiot outsiders&apos;.*
Oh, I only need one.
Well well, there you are. Another fine specimen of your kind.
[HERO] *Ask that he compose you a poem - on the house, of course. You&apos;re an illustrious hero, after all.*
Saheila&apos;s Arm
Min Koor
The reason I know so much about the Knights of Drey - the reason &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; the one who needs to stop them - well...
Spirit of a Possessed Markswoman
Living Crossbow
But before you lope away, let me ask: you are travelling... with company, yes?
After casting Spirit Vision, we noticed several spirits were following us.
Baron Judas
*Tell him that praying to Lucian is barking up the wrong tree for salvation.*
*Gently ask the dwarf what happened here.*
*She set you up. You should kill her.*
It eases my soul to hear this. I pray the Goddess will keep you safe on your journey.
Now. How do you think it feels, Quercus?
Leave me alone... please!
Here - this is the amulet. Wear it, and it will absorb some of the Source that you gather.
Relics of the old world remained, but in time they crumbled and fell, like the memories of the peoples who had built them, lost to time like sand in the wind.
What... What are you getting at, lad?
I don&apos;t do it for the money.
*As you enter the room you see three skeletons sitting around a table, cards in hand. They creak and turn to stare at you.*
*BAA!*
*Deny it.*
*Say &apos;River&apos;.*
*Wonder what he intends to do now.*
Hrrmm... Grisha&apos;s still the favourite...
*Show him the object you found. Is this what he wanted?*
This makes no sense.
[SEBILLE] *Say your eyes see far enough to glean his dark intentions for them.*
I... Well I suppose I understand. But the time will come that you&apos;ll celebrate. I know it!
Isbeil was planted in the Royal Court quite some time ago.
I summoned demons, the most dangerous game in the world. But they knew they met their match in me, and so we conversed; we drank wine; we played chess.
We think alike, you and I. See the captain, adventurer, he&apos;ll put some work your way.
*She slumps in her seat, looking even more miserable and dejected than ever.*
Magic in the Air&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Here, Huwbert warns of the dangers of those Sourcerers who may manipulate the very air. The wind, he says, may be bidden and twisted to unnatural ends, and lightning, he notes, may very well strike twice. Or indeed thrice, should the victim be deemed deserving.*
I sensed no danger. Who would, if a cook approached them, smiling...?
*Leave Jonathan to his sanctimony.*
Bah, take a hike then. I don&apos;t need your pocket lint anyway.
*Suggest that maybe there aren&apos;t that many spare faces lying around...*
List of Prisoners
You need something? Or you just enjoy watching men die?
I trusted in Lucian&apos;s mercy. In his protection. Yet all of it, &lt;i&gt;lies.&lt;/i&gt; Jonathan&apos;s lies. Lucian&apos;s lies. &lt;i&gt;Your lies.&lt;/i&gt;
*The belt may have been gnawed by rodents and reptiles, but the name engraved on its buckle is unmistakeable: &apos;Victor&apos;.*
Alright, buddy. Colour me convinced. Excited, even...
*You&apos;ve heard that Amadia has something to do with magic? Ask for more details.*
Our tastes are different to the others - you know this. Trust me, you don&apos;t wish to have your mind clouded with the last moments of the dumb animals that end up in my pot.
The Godwoken are helping their gods. I&apos;ll need to be stronger than them if I am to ascend.
*She smiles warmly, laying her hand on yours. &apos;My child,&apos; she whispers. &apos;My child...&apos;*
Isbeil&apos;s Missive
*The Queen&apos;s eyes grow wide and she nods appreciatively, then looks to Isbeil to continue the ovations.*
I... I... Mother, I have no words for that.
Nice doing business with you, I wish I had better wares to offer.
&lt;br&gt;From Fists: [1]-[2]
*With a casual flick of the wrist she withdraws the needle from your neck and smiles as if she just invited you to sit down for tea.*
*Accuse him of being reckless. He put the region in danger.*
[FANE] *A crude tool. Cruder still when it&apos;s broken. Ask why he still holds it.*
Mystical Large Flame Rune
*Reach out and take his hand. You&apos;re together now. That&apos;s what matters.*
I should stop caring so much, but the kids shouldn&apos;t suffer. They don&apos;t deserve this Void-infested hellhole we&apos;re handing to them.
It&apos;s water. Putting it in a bottle doesn&apos;t make it any fancier.
&lt;b&gt;The Void, the Divine Order, the God King and his Voidwoken - it&apos;s very confusing. But maybe we can make sense of it together?&lt;/b&gt;
The spirit of the Godwoken initiate Taryan Graye was desperate to know what happened to her lover Raedalus.
Lovely instrument, that. I could go all night with that little incentive at my beck and call.
*Reach towards the sculpture.*
*Tell the door you work with no-one, and you&apos;ll batter it down if it won&apos;t open up.*
*Uh-oh.*
Haven&apos;t you heard? Bishop Alexandar, the Divine&apos;s own son, is &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. He will ascend. He will protect us from this darkness.
Hmm? The ground? I don&apos;t know what you... I&apos;m just trying to work it out. What happened. Why.
More likely than you think. But it means keeping your pride in check.
*He appraises you with a look... then grimly grins.*
Black Ring Captain
Create Water Surface
You savage! I hope you &lt;i&gt;choke &lt;/i&gt;on me!
A letter finished, but unsent.
I beg your pardon? You would interrupt your genial hostess?
You think I like it? It&apos;s a compulsion. And I have to live with it. But I think you should focus your attention on the rather large Voidwoken just... over... there.
*The boy&apos;s frown turns to a smile, and he beams like the summer sun. You see some of you in him, from a simpler time when the future looked bright and endless.*
*Grab him by the collarbones and demand he tells you about the Deathfog.*
Keep those grubby mitts of yours away from me, dwarf!
I&apos;m getting tired of this. Senseless death and corpses...
All that fighting&apos;ll be worth less than nothing if we can&apos;t get this tub moving!
Reset all cooldowns. Removes Burning, Necrofire, Poisoned, Bleeding.
Barnacled Chest
And then there was you.
*...then her fingers run across the names tattooed upon your skin, and her blind eyes see it all.*
Bring Lohar&apos;s head to Magister Julian.
*Note that he seems to haunt one of his own kind - ask why.*
Ifan wants to ascend to Divinity at the Well of Ascension. I agreed and will stand beside him.
This used to be farmland. Beautiful land. Perfect land. Good for growing. Good to raise a family by. Good, good...
*Tell her you&apos;re going to set the Meistr free. She&apos;d be wise to stand aside.*
Pearst was one of the finest men I&apos;ve ever known - &lt;i&gt;apologise!&lt;/i&gt;
An eternity of pain and suffering is mine.
Ancestor Tree
Farewell, &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. Enjoy the prestige of being amongst the last of your kind.
Torture Chair
You will not kneel before me like you kneeled before a lizard? You will not kiss my feet like you kissed your Master&apos;s?
Well, that was fun. But alas, all good things come to their end.
*The squirrel looks at you in shock. Are you sure you want to chase him away?*
Red Prince... Art thou truly he...? Of prophecy foretold... Augured in ancient melody...
Paladin Alzette
Wait. Before we go any further, I have to tell you something.
Rabbit Hole
Let&apos;s say you&apos;ve potential for perfection, most certainly. It is in your blood...
Another card?
Spirit of Pox
Let&apos;s just say that we had a &lt;i&gt;monstrous &lt;/i&gt;day on the job.
Do you mean it? You will support me?
Retreat from me! I may have lost my Source but I can still best a grave-crawler like yourself...
Tube
*Tell her to give you one good reason not to turn her over to the Magisters for illegal dealing.*
Hey, hi.
*He slips the ring onto his finger, where it dangles loose.*
*Nod. You&apos;re on your guard.*
Lovely. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me... &lt;i&gt;I must work.&lt;/i&gt;
Greetings! It&apos;s a brave lizard who travels this road. It&apos;s a braver one who crosses the bridge and travels east. You have my admiration; it&apos;s a hellscape out there.
*Ask what he means - blood and oil don&apos;t mix, surely?*
*Offer to rub the crocodile&apos;s belly - it&apos;ll go right to sleep and feel better in no time.*
*Yarrow and Migo talk between each other in low whispers. Steady, wet streams trickle down both their cheeks.*
Azure Flint
But the Nameless Isle awaits! The Great Mother calls you with every breath of wind that rustles through her leaves.
[SEBILLE] *Tell them an adventurous spirit knows no bounds.*
*Actually you&apos;d rather just leave...*
*She draws closer to you;. The heat of her body fills the spaces between your bones.*
