My husband needs help, please!
I&apos;m just about to create a scene.
but what of the gods?
Nothing strange here. No, nothing at all. Farewell, now!
My employers are... very curious, you see. Very curious and very powerful. It wouldn&apos;t behove either of us to cross them.
Squall if you must. I am still your god. I will &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;be your god.
Run. For the love of the Seven, run!
It&apos;s good to see Gwyd, but... we&apos;ve lost so much. Why do the Gods let such bad things happen... ?
But Unnis, I can -

What&apos;s this? Guards, what is this prisoner doing here?
I&apos;ll keep an eye on her until she&apos;s ready to fend for herself. If you find yourself in need of potions or healing, be sure to come to me. It&apos;s the least I can do.
*Wonder what she&apos;s doing.*
I see. Well, I had rather you didn&apos;t. I had rather continue to contemplate the sea, and see you continue along your merry way. Wouldn&apos;t that be preferable?
Kvyn&apos;s Hands
H, I, J K *COUGH!*
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for something with a little more... spice.*

*Raise your weapon. This deceitful creature should not be allowed to live.*
Draught of Constitution
With Adramahlihk, I rose to Divinity. Can our alliance hold? Who would win the battle between dark and light? Time, as always, will tell.
*- and then he is gone.*
Gareth&apos;s back... it&apos;s a pity not all the wounded lived to see him, he might have given them the strength to go on...

I have made it this far; now there&apos;s only a little length of ground to cover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hear them talking, these strange creatures. One is a royal, I believe. The others her disciples? But from what I can tell, they&apos;ve been locked down here a long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My strategy is stealth. I&apos;ll sneak past them during one of the royal&apos;s more impassioned speeches, and they&apos;ll likely not even notice me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Home! To Carvo, to Rusket, to my farm again!

*He chuckles, a wide, flat grin spreading across his face.*
&lt;b&gt;Beautiful... but no. We did not do this. In time, we will do better.&lt;/b&gt;
*Closer attention shows a deep groove worn into his neck, presumably the legacy of a Source collar he was once fitted with. He waits still, no aura of urgency whatsoever.*
*Ifan lies motionless, curled on the ground like an animal. Under his shaggy hair, you can see green eyes fluttering as if in a nightmare. A low whine escapes his lips.*
*Tell her she&apos;s rude, and turn away.*
Audrey
*She soaks up a steady stream of tears with her shirtsleeve.*
*Prays...* I pledge myself to you, O Lucian. Please... *Blinks...* You&apos;re not Lucian. *Prays...* I pledge my soul to you, O Lucian.
Mewl.
The Cup of Kings
Trust me that I have my reasons. So? What&apos;s your price?
It was after Alexandar assembled the quorum that Isbeil turned my mind to thoughts of war. Our scouts and spies aided dwarven Sourcerers where and when they could, but Isbeil insisted the monks and shriekers would touch dwarven land.

But we&apos;ve stood about talking long enough, and this place is no roadside tavern. It&apos;s certain death if we keep lingering!

*Sympathise with them; it sounds like a terrible fate, whatever their crimes.*
Who would wish Arhu harm? It makes no sense.
Deliver the Deathfog device to the Mother Tree.
Naught but the demon I&apos;m hunting. A trivial task really, compared to your current pursuits of divinity.
We&apos;ll take back the Source that was stolen from us to restore ourselves as Eternals. Then we&apos;ll use the Source of the Seven to close the hole they created.
We&apos;d better get a move on. You&apos;ve got your business to handle, and now... I&apos;ve got mine.
*Tell him your name.*
You have my admiration and my thanks.
*Say you don&apos;t need to hear voices to find out about that. You just need to be a Magister.*
[ELF] *Tell him you belong to Tir-Cendelius.*
If it gets me out of this tedious conversation, I&apos;ll do it. Go find the Whites. They&apos;ll put an end to you.
I never saw myself as a hero. But then again, maybe I never really saw &lt;i&gt;myself &lt;/i&gt;before.
*Say she must have noticed she was pushing into bone, not flesh.*
Come now, darling. If you&apos;re going to talk like that, you might as well stop talking.

*Tell her Sister Avenny has authorised your entry to Arhu&apos;s chambers. Demand she let you pass.*

*Say you are satisfied.*
Undead Dwarf
*Cut the rope.*
Come off it. You don&apos;t give a damn what happens to me. You&apos;re just worried that thing&apos;ll get &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;into trouble.
*He stays well back from you and growls over any attempt you make to communicate.*
Enjoy the money while you can.

We kept the potion for ourselves.
*Jahan looks at you utterly flabbergasted, but soon an air of serenity descends upon him: that of a chess player overlooking the board.*
*Gareth? Tell him you know of a Seeker by that name. He&apos;s passed away, though.*
*Your vision clouds and you open your eyes to a dark glade. Before you lies a bull, trapped beneath a fallen tree. It stares at you with malevolent eyes.*
Lohar the Dwarf became mayor. His time in office was cut short by an unfortunate wound that spontaneously appeared on his neck.

You&apos;ve upset my wife and ruined a mighty fine piece of cheese! &lt;i&gt;Un-for-givable!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh Mighty Duna, save your children... deliver us from the Void... and watch over the pilgrim who speaks your noble words...&lt;/i&gt;
To the lucky claimant:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are holding this letter, you have already proven yourself a capable student of spycraft. Now, it’s time to take the next step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can find me in Arx, along the docks behind the toyseller’s house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep your head low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Victor Voss
*The Dreamer manifests, bright with power. She turns to you, determination shining in her eyes.*
Hmph.
The fish is indeed malignant! Elves are affected by it in the same manner as other species! Perhaps a touch more... &lt;i&gt;vivid &lt;/i&gt;in their hallucinations, but otherwise identical!
Explore the Horrorsleep.
*Question if it knows what these dead people are supposed to have done.*

*The woman senses your pleasure and shifts uneasily in her seat.*
You&apos;ve met that troll before? Boy, am I jealous! Maybe I should just, you know... go over there and talk to it...
I can smell your bone marrow... delicious...
Listen to me demon. I know why you chose her. I know what it is you fear the most and therefore desire the most. But I&apos;ll not let her serve you any longer!
Prayers to Lucian
But... ignore me. Captain Orell&apos;s the source of good information around here. The rest of us can only speculate.
*You want those hands all over you.*
*Sallow retreats, angry and sore - but most of all weak. You sense that this is not something to which Sallow is accustomed. You can feel the Sallow Man&apos;s fear. And then an ominous rumble begins...*
*Say you&apos;re exceedingly glad things didn&apos;t turn out that way.*
