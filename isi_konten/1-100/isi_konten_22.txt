Zaleskar himself though, the Magisters can&apos;t see him. He&apos;s out there, in the marshes beyond the fort.
*That longing reemerges with twice the strength. You need that beam of hope, an anchor to home.*
*Ask what his plans are.*
You know what&apos;s dangerous is running around Rivellon with a demon in your head. Come on - this is what I&apos;ve been waiting for.
It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; worth it, wasn&apos;t it? Now, baby, it&apos;s time for you to leave.
Justinia!
Remove Petrified and Frozen from target character. Vaporise ground surfaces into clouds. Does not work on Oil, Ice or Lava surfaces.
Ah, Quercus, did you forget about our shield? It seems it hasn&apos;t forgotten about us. Despite appearances...
I ain&apos;t a savage. But some people gotta learn.
*You hear the roar of fire, the crack of burnt awnings falling; the spirit stands before you, silent among the wreckage, his skin half-melted down his face.*
Fie!
Sounds like a good deal to me. The gal right there can tell you more, I reckon.
...and by the way... *whispers* &lt;i&gt;I like you too.&lt;/i&gt;
Organisation is my middle name.
Lohse snuffed out the arch-demon&apos;s captive souls. He&apos;ll be weaker now, and easier to kill.
[RED PRINCE] *Relent. After all, you&apos;ve proved stronger than a succubus before...*
Oh, most blessed child. Pray, what may I do for you?
But... something far worse happens first. Worse than the death of Sarias, who we love. It is why we come here at all.
One of us paid Lovrik for an intimate liaison. The top floor of the tavern awaits...
*He turns his gaze toward the corpse of Lone Wolf Pigsbane. His peeping skull cracks into a grin. He turns to you and bows.*
Directions to Enter Oil Cave Safely
She intrigues me greatly. I&apos;d say it was brave of her to send Lohse after a demon hunter, but bravery implies something to be feared - she&apos;s fearless.
My companion stands with me. Whatever you have to say to me, he may hear.
Escape the island.
Troll
[OUTLAW] *Chuckle, and hold up a coin you&apos;d pilfered from her pocket while she was talking. Maybe she&apos;s not as good as she thinks she is...*
&lt;i&gt;God &lt;/i&gt;did.
In the recent past, Queen Justinia successfully suppressed a rebellion, but the Dwarven Kingdom is still riven with internal strife.
*Tell her you found a bottle of the potion.*
*He quickly turns away and casts a worried gaze around the room, counting something on his fingers.*
He went from a bad mother to a worse father. How very unlucky.
My ears are ringing, but the infernal bell is gone.
Longclaw
*Tilt your head curiously. He may call you F-Fane.*
[IFAN] *Ask her if your future is less bloody than your past.*
Crafting Bible, Part VIII
Take it from me: If a weird, greenish-looking version of yourself tries to lure you to an altar in the woods - &lt;i&gt;don&apos;t go!&lt;/i&gt;
*Stay silent and watch the scene unfold.*
*Go for that stroll. You prefer this just to be over.*
&lt;i&gt;I called a hero from the chaff; I called him here to me. I called a hero from below, and he shall set us free.&lt;/i&gt;
What harm conversation? It is the only freedom that remains to me...
*She stumbles back a few paces and wipes her mouth.*
*He blanches and staggers backwards a step, all bravado punctured.*
Very well. But do return. Together, we might yet escape the Magisters&apos; den.
The undead necromancers&apos; Soul Jars were hidden in a secret treasury. Without them, they&apos;ll never find peace.
Lohar
Sing for me (Lohse&apos;s version)
And so the hunt commences once more! May the Seven be on our side...
His run-in with his daughter set Fane on a new path. He travelled Rivellon, recording the wonders he discovered, but always kept a socket peeled for signs of the Eternals. He hoped to find the wife he&apos;d lost, but he never did. Then again, he&apos;s still looking.
Iguana Necklace
Odd Skeletal Arm
Keep what I told you to yourself, y&apos;hear? We can&apos;t stop the riff-raff going in there, but there&apos;s no need to lay out the red carpet for &apos;em either...
*Admit you&apos;ve got cold feet. You don&apos;t want this.*
A lead-weight arrow that&apos;s almost too heavy to fire. Almost.
Speak to the guard.
Rubbish!
Oh, darling. Malady invited me, of course. She said you&apos;d need all the help you could get.
Welcome, blessed of Amadia. I am told you are the one that returned Gareth to his flock?
Hello! Let&apos;s play the game.
[RED PRINCE] *Your deepest self? Good. Say you&apos;ve been starved for proper company.*
Ngh! Blocked.
[ELF] *Offer to take a pound of her flesh for lunch if she threatens you again.*
I&apos;m Helene! Hero of the whole world! Who are you?
Kick Player
SqueakSqueakSqueakSqueakSqueakSqueak!
You&apos;ve done right by me. For that, I&apos;m grateful.
*Ask him how he knows where his soul is kept.*
Progress is annihilation of one way of life by another. I guess &lt;i&gt;we&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; progress.
&lt;b&gt;Grkzzzzxx&apos;s Dig Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... and of course, as all imps know, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; kind of tomfoolery just cannot be permitted! So, with the aid of a royal grant, I studied advanced methods of digging from barely-accessible planes. Hydraulics. Hoists. Derricks. These words mean little to you, but simply follow my easy diagrams to reach the deepest depths yet plumbed by sentient life!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[The &apos;easy&apos; diagrams accompanying the research look like they would take an army of advanced scientific geniuses to unravel and follow.]&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s easiest if I show you. Let me see your map.
You ok?
*Breathe in and out again. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;gone.*&lt;/i&gt;
I do not confide in &lt;i&gt;reptilian fops&lt;/i&gt;. Whatever measure you have of yourself is no doubt bloated by the labours of slaves. Leave me.
*Say that you distinctly remember her saying that you were &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;her thrall, and refuse to help.*
It&apos;s an arena. You bash things until they&apos;re dead. It&apos;s how we worship. Ain&apos;t sure what else you need to know.
*Ahem* Hmmm. Am I awake? I think I need a pinch... or, no, hang on. It&apos;s you. They said you&apos;d be red, but I didn&apos;t think so, so very red. Hmmm.
Magical Mail Hood
*He prays on, his eyes still tightly shut.*
*Lean back and smile. You wouldn&apos;t mind seeing that again.*
Most creatures are smart enough not to attack wolves. Teach yours... or I will.
*Rub your ear. Malady, was it? Is she sick or something?*
Burning status and fire damage is ignored.
*He peers into your eyes, looking for a sign of honest intent - and satisfied, his face softens.*
Lobby Settings
Magical Light Metal Pants
*Assure him that you were just making conversation and take your leave.*
You dare make a bargain you can&apos;t actually afford.
*A well-dressed dwarf paces around the room, overseeing the packing of trunks. He doesn&apos;t look up as he addresses you.*
Sebille&apos;s Blood Vial
Farmers&apos; Savings
*She spins the bottle; it twirls and twirls... and comes to a rest pointing into a no-man&apos;s land to the left of your knee.*
Deathdealer
Retreeeeat! Retreeeeat!
Now if you&apos;ll recall, as per your own testimony you can cook, but alas you lack a sense of fashion and you&apos;ve little or no regard for personal hygiene. Far from ideal.
*The child screws up his face and looks at you, hard. He hold up his little mirror and peers into it, inspecting your reflection.*
I&apos;d be dead if it weren&apos;t for you. My thanks, stranger.
Ah-ah! Not so fast. I must do as I&apos;ve been instructed - and that involves you! All I need is a bit of feedback, and you can be quickly on your way!
Neither. Both. I am a Dragon Knight, the last of my bloodline. Shifting between two shapes is our greatest gift.
Blue Mushroom
Inactiv&lt;i&gt;vviiikikik&lt;/i&gt;ity has caused further damage - I cannot ac&lt;i&gt;Kkzz&lt;/i&gt;ess my full faculties. Unfortunate, but I shall help you however pos&lt;i&gt;zzzizzi&lt;/i&gt;sible.
Stone Wand
Poor thing... how did this happen to you...?
*His words carry an unearthly command. You feel more compelled to obey than ever. You kneel.*

Rhymes Of The Scribes, Part 5
Good choice, good ch-AWK-oice. And I&apos;ll give you a little something for your trouble after...
Gave me an enchanted coat of arms, did he. Made my word the law, did they. &lt;i&gt;None &lt;/i&gt;could resist me.
*Fall to your knees as a sob shakes your chest. It wasn&apos;t you. It wasn&apos;t...*
*Ask what&apos;s the matter.*
My child, my child... I love you. My own, my own... I will guard you. Wander where you will and cherish the kiss of Amadia.
*Suggest: &apos;She&apos;ll soon be of no use to man... or Beast!&apos;*
*Tell him to watch his tone. People died to get him on this boat.*
Blackpits Cave
&lt;i&gt;First &lt;/i&gt;tell me where we&apos;re going.
*Say you&apos;re still interested in his stories.*
*The fawn&apos;s breathing is shallow and ragged, but it nudges a stone towards you. Leaning down, you pick up a round, white rock.*
Stop it! You&apos;re not a person. You&apos;re just &lt;i&gt;wearing &lt;/i&gt;a person. Don&apos;t hurt me! Please!
We will see about that.
I am done. This is done. Go, and do what you will.
A few hours ago, that might have helped. Look at their pallor. Only magic can pull them back from the brink now.
This would be so much easier if I had a sword.
Glowing Grips
What would you know about it? The beauty we created together was unparalleled!
*Ask her what she plans to do now.*
A word of warning to you, Fane, my mysterious friend, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait  - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
*She places a light hand on your shoulder.*
A humble, steadfast, and deadly vegetable.
*Nod with the last of your strength. Tell him where the Lady Vengeance is docked.*
Leave the Doctor.
I have not met many who share your view. Nethertheless, you are welcome here.
*She takes a draught and blows the smoke towards the sky... ignoring you.*
Shadowcloak Spellweaver
Huh?! Whuh?!
&apos;They&apos; is them. Yes. Those. There are many words for them, but I&apos;m having trouble finding the right ones.
*The trembling of the dwarven spirit tells you the halberd in his hands may not be enough to withstand his unseen enemy. He glances behind him, searching for an escape...*

Helm of Contamination
Consul Zara would rather see her ashes in the wind than her treasure in the hands of an ape.
You&apos;ve added to [1] chronicles.
I&apos;m so glad the egg is ba... What, where is it? What happened?!
Bone Widow&apos;s damage is increased.
Och. I ain&apos;t takin&apos; that guilt trip. I ain&apos;t gonna stop yer rowdy ways - but I ain&apos;t gonna help ya, either. If you want to make music &apos;stead of war, I&apos;ll be around.
Graveyard Key

Icicles fall from the sky, chilling characters and dealing [1]. They create Ice surfaces where they hit the ground.
You there! Be sure not to obstruct Paladin business - we&apos;re to search this place top to bottom.

*Suggest that she give in, if only to shut him up.*
