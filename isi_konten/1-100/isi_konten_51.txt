Haha! Definitely not. Just a... me. Most of the time.
*The woman in front of you yawns so wide you can almost see what she had for lunch. Catching your eye across her wares, she rolls both of her own.*
Well then. Let&apos;s go make &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;happen.
It really is quite simple. In the corner there&apos;s a painting. Remove it and push the button behind it. Then we may move on to the vault.
But I&apos;m so little, and you&apos;re so big!
Good heavens, what on earth made you do that? Haven&apos;t you any manners? Any courtesy?
The Great War.
Character Creation Zoom in
*Thieves&apos; Guild? Interesting. Ask what that&apos;s all about.*
Hiya! I mean hey, how are you? All settled in, myself. Can&apos;t tell you how glad I am to be here. And thank you for bringing me.
Oh, but you&apos;re a slave too, lizardling: a slave to Source, hmmm? Just like the rest of your heathen kind.
But there was another jar, was there not? Another relic? Engraved with my name? Please, you must find it!
Healing Potion
Short and shadowy, this dagger is capable of piercing to the very heart of an argument. Twice.
One of your items is damaged. Find a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;repair hammer&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;trader&lt;/font&gt; to restore it.
This chest recognises Consul Zara as master. Speak her words or return me to the flames.
*Ask Ifan if he knows who the murderer the Magisters seek is.*
Mark a target so that it will receive all the damage you receive. Damage transferred in this way ignores any resistances the target may have.
Yer stayin&apos; put. You ain&apos;t got the presence of the One in ya, far as I can tell.
*You recall Tungs&apos; exuberant poetry, which makes his silence all the more striking. Even death has not freed him from the torture he clearly suffered at the Doctor&apos;s hands.*
Another blow-in?
Matchetty
*Ask what happened to her.*
Around here? All living entails is pain&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;A wiser wish would be &lt;i&gt;not dying&lt;/i&gt;. Again.
Go there... please... find my ring... release me...
*Tell it it&apos;s right, then take your leave.*
There there, lass. Don&apos;t you worry, Gareth&apos;ll be back soon. You&apos;ll see - he&apos;ll be back...
*You feel the Source return to your body the moment you break contact. The creature shivers, then emits a shout that reverberates through the chamber.*
With our help, the Paladins have uncovered a foul Magister plot. They have informed their superiors in Arx. Trouble brews in the Order.
I set sail from Reaper&apos;s Coast. I will learn no more about the altar voice, it seems.
Doesn&apos;t do to attack imperial agents, you naughty little scamp! Doesn&apos;t do at all!
*Tell her no-one cares. No-one cares at all.*
You pay for that!
Heavenly Strike
Void-touched
THOU SPEAKETH THE TRUTH. DOST THOU KILL?
Well, it&apos;s time you got one. You&apos;re going to tell your friends, and your neighbours, and every stranger you meet about this. You&apos;ll be a regular historian.
Cleanse Wounds Skillbook
Magister Sevek
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? A sulking creeper?
Even as I reach for redemption, it moves further away.
Oh, honey, you should be! It was a trust not lightly given, I assure you.
Can you feel it, elf?
*Step away.*
I must ask... why do you seek these powers?
Arms
Given enough time, I could walk from this island to the shore, but time is in short supply.
*She flicks her long, black tongue over cracked lips while staring unblinkingly. Her eyes reflect no light - they only consume.*
Oh gods! Uh... okay then. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;can pay me later. Or whenever you like, really. *Swallows...*
My word, I never met a royal before. On t-the run from Fort Joy, are you?
*Tell her you have a shipment of valuable... equipment... arriving from Driftwood. You just need to pay the ship&apos;s captain. You have a buyer already lined up, and you&apos;ll double your money.*
*Ask her how she got that scar.*
*She sighs.*
Ruins
As for me, the poor lowly mortal, I&apos;ve got business of my own to attend to.
Spirit of Isla Gall
Strip Armour
[IFAN] *Say your name is Ifan. Ifan ben-Mezd. Yes, you know it&apos;s hard to pronounce...*
Hold there, lizard! I answered your question, but you did not answer mine.
The Void said I could have eternal power. That I could be the light of the world.
To be honest, so did I. When we first arrived on the island, I could barely keep a lid on it. But when we fought the Gods, it suddenly grew quiet.
&apos;cuz what&apos;s a damn grave but another kind of prison?
*Slap his hand away from you.*
Speak to Gareth.
*Ask him if he needs a moment to compose himself. He seems to be a bit flustered.*
Attributes
Turn a nearby target to stone, incapacitating it. Deal [1]. Removes Bleeding, Burning, Poisoned, and Crippled.
&lt;i&gt;Strange sounds?&lt;/i&gt; You shameless little...
Devour a corpse to heal and increase damage by [1]%.
Hey, cut it out!
*He nods, tearful. He leans towards you, a plea for forgiveness in his eyes... and you feel him slide the hilt of a dagger into your hand.*
Don&apos;t break your brain over &apos;shouldn&apos;t&apos;. I had fun. Did you have fun? Ok then. It&apos;s settled.
*Nod. You haven&apos;t felt whole for many, many centuries.*
*She eagerly returns your kiss, long and sweet as rosewater.*
*A lich? Ask what she&apos;s talking about.*
*Lambo wags his tail, his tongue lolling from his mouth. He&apos;s a happy dog.*
Kraken sighted at sea! Several ships missing!
That&apos;s Magister business. Keep your nose out of it.
Aye. The &lt;i&gt;right &lt;/i&gt;enemies.
*Look into his eyes and share the truth. He was Gareth&apos;s bounty, and you the hunter.*
Her words are wise, Sebille.
I was fully briefed about this awful place before I came. My goal was to destroy the fiend who had been marshalling the world&apos;s most unwholesome weapons and magic into an army he intended to use against the realm.
&lt;i&gt;Here is the truth. I have killed thousands, perhaps millions, for the greater good. But I made a mistake. It was my use of Deathfog that opened the door to the God King. It upset the Veil and took the Seven by surprise.&lt;/i&gt;
Crawwk.
Pick up the gem.
Inner Demon
Maybe we should find the Meistr? Malady seemed to think she could help.
*The creature devours the corpses as a vulture devours carrion, stopping only as you approach.*
Use [LeftStickX] to cycle through the class presets.
*Beg for a moment&apos;s audience with the God King - what would he have you do?*
APRecovery
I think maybe I was wrong before. That I could just... just get rid of him. I can still hear... something. Deep down. Like an echo, really. An echo of a whisper.
I await but your word, Master.
Wolf Amulet
*The little squirrel cowers beneath a leafy frond, peeping up at you through liquidy eyes that tremble with terror.*
[DWARF] *Tell her you&apos;d offer to search for her daughter if she&apos;d show you a little respect.*
*Alexandar produces an old cowl and mutters an incantation. The cloth glows a cool blue for a moment, before settling back. He hands the cowl over to you.*
Halt! Who goes there?
[MYSTIC] *Say you may understand her better than she thinks.*
Stalos
Diary
*A low, rumbling gurgle grows in his throat. You realise that he&apos;s... laughing.*
Glorious Ring
Applies Poisoned.
the Redeemed Divine.
Farmhand Carlevan
*Shrug. What&apos;s one more body?*
Armoured Lizard
How very novel of you, milady.
A potential combination&lt;br&gt; but needs more [1] ability
Manage
I survived... again. My contract is sea-soaked but valid. It&apos;s time to track down my mark.
Good enough for me. Keep sidin&apos; with us and you may even end up on Boss&apos;s good side. He&apos;s called Griff. Runs the kitchen. Met him yet?
Ah! We must have comrades in common!
*Ask her about her little one.*
Statue of a Knight
Ahhh, so supple...! I do &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; the feel of lizard skin. So cool and pleasant upon one&apos;s own.
You cannot change the difficulty when you are in character creation.
Sharp Stone On A Stick
*Ask how it came to be like this - a living being in the form of a Magister war vessel.*
Well then.
*The man looks at you with eyes full of pity.*
*Demand she tell you who this &apos;Lord&apos; is.*
Did she wonder if she should have given her soul and sealed the Veil?
Vicious Axe
Oh, let&apos;s not succumb to melodrama, shall we? This kind of gutter-vermin can hardly said to be &lt;i&gt;dangerous&lt;/i&gt;.
*Look her in the eyes and tell her that you have made your choice. She, Sebille, should be new Divine.*
*She looks you up and down with a grimace.*
Useless.
Haven&apos;t heard from &apos;em in a couple days now. I thought maybe we&apos;d lost the messengers to Voidwoken in the hills, but now... I think it&apos;s worse than I thought.
We plan another assault. We cannot give up. It is better for us all to die than for Saheila to be lost.
We ventured on, leaving Windego caged.
You know me, don&apos;t you? I saved you from drowning... I blessed you, made you powerful... And now I&apos;ve come to seek some power in return...
Strange. And suspicious.
*He catches a string of spittle with the back of his hand and wipes it away as a malevolent grin spreads over his face.*
Purity of Mind
*His memory flashes into yours - animals turned inside-out as a result of her use of Sourcery. The grotesquery of it does not escape you. The Sourceress seems less innocent.*
Mhordkan&apos;s hammer.
Maybe.
Help! Creature on the loose!
*Tell him all this feels a little convenient. How do you know he&apos;s not working for the Magisters?*
No! I&apos;m innocent!
*Shake your head. The armour has driven her insane.*
*Focus on the sound.*
*You slink through Kemm&apos;s mansion with the alacrity that comes with years of thievery. You arrive in the garden unseen and lay your eyes on the pool. It&apos;s just as you hoped: the pool is dry! You enter the basin and reach for the hatch...*
I have never seen a torch that holds no flame before.
My task—
Want some goooooold? &lt;i&gt;Sssssssset ussssssss free.&lt;/i&gt;
A trifling amount, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree! Payable in advance, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Tell it you want nothing to do with it. It is a parasite. Nothing more.*
I&apos;ve already lost more than I can bear today. I pray to the Seven I haven&apos;t lost him too...
*Refuse. You did not ask for this. But you will not sacrifice yourself for her.*
*You reach out to touch the altar, its cold surface a curious foil to the thrumming and clanging metal that surrounds you.*
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him he may call you the Red Prince.*
Our brothers have a Seeker cornered. We caught the rat scurrying about, trying to steal the weapons we&apos;d uncovered here.
Trained in order, obedience and warfare, you know the difference between a latrine and a lieutenant.
*Tell him Sallow said he should take a bath. Throw him a bar of &lt;i&gt;sssoap.*&lt;/i&gt;
Well, I should keep looking, then. I promise to help!
We&apos;d better get going.
Is it about the Soul Jars? Be quick, what news do you bring? Did you find them?
*Ask if it has a specific hole in the ground in mind.*
*Note that sometimes even the most loyal person must take their own path.*
Our entire mission will have been for nothing if we don&apos;t escape from here - we have to get this ship moving.
*The rat opens its mouth to speak. Can&apos;t say anything. So it nods its head. Then shakes its head. Then nods it again.*
Spirit of Meistr Siva
