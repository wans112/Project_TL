I lived free and died free, &lt;i&gt;child&lt;/i&gt;. It was only when I was reborn as part of the forest that I was stolen and enslaved... but I will obey you, for you sang the song...
Mountain Troll
The Path of Greatest Resistance
*Catch on fast and tell her yes, you&apos;re here to &apos;water her flowers&apos;.*
Matchmaking found [1] friend lobbies.
Drinks: Poisoned
*Say that you don&apos;t see any Sourcerer bodies. Where are they?*
*Stand your ground. Ask this trickster who - or what - he is.*
*Tell him there&apos;s no universe in which you could be considered his pet.*
On The Silencing of Source
Sometimes... sometimes the best way to get &lt;i&gt;on &lt;/i&gt;with something is to finish it.
Healing Tears Scroll
Because it is my desire to question him. &lt;i&gt;Intensely. &lt;/i&gt;As for the reason: you&apos;re staring at it.
*Tell him everybody needs to take responsibility for their actions, and &lt;i&gt;trust &lt;/i&gt;is an action like any other.*
*Smile. After everything you&apos;ve been through, you trust him with your life.*
[ELF] *Say you were never one for tribal ties.*
Malady will set sail once everyone&apos;s aboard.
Please, keep looking - our lives depend on it... yours as well, I&apos;d w-wager...
*Point out the long life line. Tell her she&apos;ll live many more years.*
Source Collar
I would think that obvious, my dear. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;dying&lt;/i&gt; to show off those smouldering talents of yours. You just don&apos;t know how to handle them.
Dead Black Ring Scholar
*Tell him Lohar is dead.*
*The spirit mouths the words to a mourning song. If you listen carefully, you can hear her whisper...*
*Hand her the egg you recovered.*
*Ask where these &apos;wonders&apos; are now, if they were built to last so long?*
Squee squee squee!
*Leave her to her own devices.*
I get it. Only a few fools stick their neck out for others around here. But those fools are the only folks &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; want to talk to.
*About the Hollow Marshes...*
And here there is need of you too. Thank you for helping me. Without you I am already dead.
*Ask about the nearby contraption. What are the buttons for?*
Braccus Rex will get his due. As will you.
She has never reacted with such rage! Please, I must meditate on this.
*It is truly and utterly over. The Master is dead.*
The Black Ring&apos;s pullin&apos; her strings. Should&apos;ve figured. But I gotta say - I&apos;d rather her just be straight-up cruel than simply too weak to resist an evil as flippin&apos; obvious as the Black Ring.
Malady took the Lady Vengeance into the Hall of Echoes, saving all aboard.
Not the future, no. But I can read the past in flesh. One of the perks of being an elf, you see. I&apos;m quite good at it too.
If you find out where it leads... if you see Emmie... tell her I miss her.
*The skeleton pulls a book from his robes and drops it into your hands as he wanders past.*
*A Black Ring witch stands before you, cool and collected, breathing easily, her steady gaze upon you betraying a hint of disdain... and of intrigue too. You may fancy you can hear her heart beat.*
No, there is nothing for me here. Only memories...
Please - no - mercy! Mercy!
*His coy grin freezes.*
Really? I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;shocked.&lt;/i&gt;
Dragon Fly
I&apos;ll be Lucian, and you can be the icky Voidwoken!
Take care, friend. Fight the good fight.
I did it! I killed that murdering elf! Don&apos;t you see? I&apos;m nothing like &lt;i&gt;her... &lt;/i&gt;I&apos;m a true Magister!
*Tell him this is his chance to pray to his god in person.*
By the Gods. Please, no!
And I thought we were gonna &apos;e friends. Go on then, get lost.
The Red Prince still seeks Sadha. Could she too be in Arx?
*Tell him he just made that Magister soil his breeches.*
Corpse Explosion Bone
*Say you&apos;re looking for someone who doesn&apos;t mind getting their hands dirty - picking a few locks, stabbing a few backs. A Rogue would fit the bill.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca] gold)
*The pain is sharp, but you know it won&apos;t last long. Your newfound freedom on the other hand, will.*
More Eternal relics, and more destruction. But if the other worked, then perhaps there is a chance?
The Lord Dread
*Although he admits to having very little interest in oil, Huwbertâ€™s knowledge of the Voidwoken borne of that element seems surprisingly intricate.*
And I believe you, for you told me the truth before.
*Search her memories for the story of her death.*
Come now. No such thing need happen here, provided this man can be reasoned with.
*The voice of the God King howls to you from beyond the Veil.*
*Turn to other matters.*
Truly, who has the finer bridge here? You should be working on eliminating the weakest link! Which - in case it isn&apos;t crystal clear - is &lt;i&gt;Grog!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you&apos;re looking for Mordus.*
Give the Seekers the go-ahead.
*The Voidwoken continues its journey for hours, perhaps days. You watch as familiar land and sea pass under you until the creature slows. The talons open. First air and wind. Then, a thud.*
Nemesis Heartpiercer
I am ready.
*You were a maze-builder. You had a special talent that cleared your mind and sharpened your wits. A useful skill indeed.*
*Offer her the opportunity to set the prisoner free herself.*
...and I&apos;ll be right there with you.
I am not opposed to manual labour if circumstances require.
You have brought yourself. This gives me hope.
*The disheveled pair eye you with hope, though their hope is tinged with mistrust. The lizard gasps as she notices the marks left on your neck by the Source collar. She steps towards you.*
I... I failed her. The demon&apos;s not coiled around her heart: he&apos;s &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; her heart. Try as I might, he would not shift.
Kemm has a massive vault hidden beneath his mansion. There, it&apos;s believed, he keeps his most valuable possessions.
Hrrm... well that was a rather straightforward one - you&apos;d have to be an utter dolt to have not heard of the House of Dreams...
...to deny destiny. Ain&apos;t that right, dollface?
Next Object
A bit of a choppy reentry, wasn&apos;t it? Sorry I couldn&apos;t be there to greet you, but time is limited. The Doctor will know of the crash soon enough. I need to learn as much as I can, as quickly as I can.
Well, well, well. I go look for signs of one crime, only to find evidence of another! Come on, then. Off to prison with you.
The only thing I&apos;m hiding is my desire to teach a trespasser a lesson, and I&apos;m doing an increasingly poor job of it! Now, answer me!
Teaches Skill:
You can talk, your breath smells of rot. It&apos;s... appetising, actually. See what I mean? You think this is the life I&apos;d have chosen for myself? You think I enjoy this?
*Ask what it is that screams. Demons? The Black Ring?*
If we have different paths to take, you and I, so be it.
Lucian&apos;s shrine is near. There, I find answers. I hope.
[NOBLE] *Ask him to note your bearing and listen to your diction - he&apos;ll soon see that he&apos;s making a mistake.*
Nnnngh...
I was worried when you weren&apos;t coming.
Ornate Chest
*Quietly sing the next line for her.*
Rune Frame Of Power
I do not know it, I &lt;i&gt;dream &lt;/i&gt;it. There will come a time when those who despise our customs will rise up and make war. In my dreams, I see the battles. I smell the blood of our fallen.
I sure as hell don&apos;t want to find out what&apos;s got &apos;em spooked.
It is a gift. A gift so great I sometimes wonder if I am worthy to bear it.
No. You shall &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Lever
My, I&apos;d like to have seen that! I hope he soaked his little red breeches.
THOU ART TRUE. DOST THOU RESPECT THE SOUL?
I was there when the Deathfog fell on your forests - your hedge-magic weren&apos;t much use then, eh?
*Tell him the time for mysteries is over. Ask him what he&apos;s talking about.*
I&apos;m afraid I must decline.
As you will. Please do avail yourself of the facilities. Just use caution. My... servants... prefer the valuables remain &lt;i&gt;untouched&lt;/i&gt;.
Elemental Immunity
You &lt;i&gt;remember! &lt;/i&gt;My blind eyes make you see!
*The tear is ice cold on your fingertips. You watch, but she cries no more.*
You must fall so that we may rise!
Prefers to turn the tide of battle from afar, manipulating foes with powerful magic
*Mutter that she has to sleep sooner or later... and you can wait.*
I ain&apos;t sayin&apos; nothin&apos;!
*Reach out and shake his hand. You&apos;d be glad to have him as an ally.*
Time to learn. Welcome to class.
I... fan...
*Say you are, and ask her mother&apos;s name.*
*Roll your eyes and tell the kid to run along.*
You should know something - I thought the queen was a friend of mine. But that... that all changed.
Where the hell did they go?
Dwarven Statue
The roaring in my head, the craving for living flesh. Urges. Good Gods, the urges - to kill, to hurt. The stronger they became, the harder I fought. And at some point, I was just... gone. Deadened, but not dead.
Digging. Dallis told us to come. Said we&apos;d- *groans* said we&apos;d find weapons. Said we&apos;d finally defeat Source.
*She glances at her young son&apos;s body and holds her breath, as if hoping he might stir. She exhales with a jitter a few seconds later.*
Where are you? Where did you go?
It all seems so... &lt;i&gt;unimportant,&lt;/i&gt; now. Life goes on, but without me.
You undervalue my silence. Bah!
Find the Magisters&apos; murderer.
Another pyramid? How very useful.
Didnt you hear me? Carry. &lt;i&gt;On.&lt;/i&gt;
We killed Lohar. Magister Julian wants his head. Literally.
*Breathless, the Paladin fishes out a canteen of water. He gulps half of it down, then splashes blood and grime from his face with the rest. He nods to you, a touch wary.*
Our journey will be fraught with peril: it is a pilgrimage of challenges that will require you to command Source like only a Godwoken can, and wield its most powerful spells.
Had to shutter after the last of the elf raids, though. They were &lt;i&gt;brutal&lt;/i&gt;. Can&apos;t say I blame &apos;em, what with how quick we were turning over those trees of theirs. But a fellas got to make a living, you know.
+1 Source Point
*Send an emotion into her world; forgiveness. Give it the power to defeat all the anger, the fear, and the hate. Give her the strength to let go.*
[1] improves your haggling skills. With each point invested, traders&apos; items become cheaper and your items become more expensive.
*The old dog looks up at you but doesn&apos;t lift his greying head from his paws. He heaves a heavy sigh.*
*The cat purrs loudly as it curls itself around your ankles. Looks like you got yourself a new pet!*
Goodness. Why must the dwarven mind be so &lt;i&gt;feeble?&lt;/i&gt; To think, a simpleton touched with Divinity. The Gods really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;cruel.
It&apos;s not so much that my desires have changed, it&apos;s that they&apos;ve multiplied. They were like... like a diamond kept hidden in a secret pocket for none but me to see, but then the diamond was forced into the open; held against the light. And in that light: so many colours I never knew were there.
&lt;i&gt;Hail, hail, hail...&lt;/i&gt;
*Roost bursts into laughter, great peals of it wracking his frame. Then, too quickly, he sobers completely and pins Ifan with a viperish gaze.*
*Ask him what this is meant to do.*
A Dwarven shield forged in the halls of long-forgotten kings.
*Nod slowly. How did he know you were Godwoken?*
