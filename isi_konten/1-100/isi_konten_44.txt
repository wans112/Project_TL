Oh, but heading to the Blackpits would mean tangling with more Magisters... and they&apos;re &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a nuisance. I like keeping my hands clean, you see.
Woe Tine
*She stares at you, unblinking. You can tell that you&apos;re making her nervous.*
*Take a body part from your bag and toss it to the wargs.*
*Agree - desertion is shameful indeed.*
Pouch Of Superior Pixie Dust
*Take the proffered key. Basement. Stuff. Got it.*
*The grim-faced guard raises his weapon as you approach - then stops short and quickly bows respectfully.*
[Inside, this elaborate tome is curiously empty.]
Voidwoken. &lt;i&gt;Here. &lt;/i&gt;And who&apos;ll clean up that mess in the garden? *shudders* It&apos;ll be me, the new guy...
Who in the hell DID THIS?
*Say that she admitted it to your face - isn&apos;t that enough?*
*Dismiss him out of hand. Love is not as poets dream. It is sadistic, not restorative. Greatness demands you resist it.*
Animators Reference: 1H WeaponSet
But you believed in them enough to get them this far... and I trust you.
[1] improves your casting ability of fire-based spells.
You&apos;re back. And you brought... but... but who&apos;s this?
Wind Canyon 02
*Insist he climb off his high horse. Humans aren&apos;t all that bad... are they? Er... are you?*
*Say that it was the least you could do, and ask what happened to him.*
What&apos;s wrong with th... guards! Come! The Godwoken&apos;s broken free of my spell!
&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is where the road to divinity leads. And you must be the first to reach it at all costs.
If I understand this ranger rhyme correctly, these verses seem to claim that you can carve a stunning arrowhead from a tooth. Worth a try, even it turns out to be gibberish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ll chip a tooth&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ll cut a molar&lt;br&gt;I tell you I can cut them up if you&apos;re the donor&lt;br&gt;I shape them sharp&lt;br&gt;I carve them spiky&lt;br&gt;Into an arrowhead that&apos;s oh so very likely&lt;br&gt;To stun the foe&lt;br&gt;To shock the rival&lt;br&gt;They will be floored so you can run for your survival
Chameleon Cloak
Philistine.
Horrorsleep Arena
Can&apos;t describe it to you any plainer than that!
Elf Friend
Sister, in the heart of every slave burns the brightest freedom. That flame can consume you whole, or it can ignite your true purpose. Keep watch...
I always felt safe in Amadia&apos;s presence, but now that the Voidwoken stalk the swamp... perhaps you are right.
Vincent Townsend
Resume
*You feel yourself shine with an inner light; rejuvenated and pure, as if born anew.*
[SOLDIER] *Remark that death is inevitable. For normal people.*
Friends Only
*Sir Lora grabs your pinky with his tiny paw. He gives it a decisive shake, then salutes.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the matter behind.
Perhaps... but I doubt you&apos;ll live long enough to find it. There&apos;s a price on your head wherever you go on this island, Godwoken. Farewell.
You carry enough weapons and sundries to burden an overmuscled ox. And like most armoured residents of Arx, your pursuits are not likely intellectual.
UI Map Zoom Out
*You step away from the pillar, your mind racing.*
Scan. Environment. Receive. Input.
I don&apos;t like the smell o&apos; you, &lt;i&gt;Beast, &lt;/i&gt;and I don&apos;t like the smell o&apos; this. But it&apos;s above my pay grade. This gate is closed. See the guard by the door in the general store. And get out of my face.
*Say that you have in fact met Wainslow... but he too has died.*
You still hanging around? Walk on, stranger, you&apos;re of no use to me and you&apos;re scarin&apos; the fish away.
*He laughs - lightly at first, then heartily. Then the laughter stops. The spirit looks to you in terror, but before he can put words to his fears...*
*Grunt and walk away.*
But... I mean... we don&apos;t have to play. If you don&apos;t want to.
*Ask what this place is - memories of a battle?*
Allow other [1] users to join your game
Pile of Ash
*Say that earlier, on the beach, she mentioned someone who wanted to meet you - the Meistr. Who did she mean?*
Journey to the city of Arx.
*Whatever. Take your leave of the lying rat.*
*Mordus reaches out to you - his quivering hand desperately grasping for help until it snaps cleanly in half and falls to the floor.*
Well, what a swollen swine you are! This fella won&apos;t accept the healing I&apos;ve offered him, I&apos;ll have ye know. Intent on callin&apos; the reaper over with them wails of his. I figure I might as well give him a little peace, if that&apos;s alright with &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; mister.
You don&apos;t know &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;gal, then. She&apos;s a survivor.
[LOHSE] *Ask him if he knows it wasn&apos;t really &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; that killed her.*
There must be a way to spring this trap safely.
Their place in the war on the Void would entirely depend on the integrity of the new Divine.
We barely made it indoors alive. But not everyone was so lucky. I... I can hardly bear to think of them. Their wives and husbands and children back in the kingdom, left to grieve alone...
They may have been a necromancer, but they did not &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;evil. Misguided, perhaps.
*The urn throbs in time with your grief, and thrums into a heartbeat: the familiar &lt;i&gt;tar-anta-taran-tar-anta &lt;/i&gt;of Sir Lora.*
*He searches your face for the lie. Doesn&apos;t find it. The compliment touches him. He smiles. Reaches for you...*
Get your revenge on Dorian Gall.
The Black Ring witch Almira roams Paradise Downs. An escapee from Magister custody, she may be a suitable mentor.
We have our reasons, and they are good, but they are not for me to tell. Tovah leads us and leads us well, from the moment the mists of death descend right to this moment here.
Unarmed Elf
Deal with the Doctor.
Aye. Was planning to build me a raft and paddle off. I&apos;ve got business north of here, in a town called Driftwood. Far be it from me to miss an appointment.
Then again... Perhaps you&apos;re right.
Prove your strength, and reap the reward, Godwoken. You will ascend. And you will make these cowards &lt;i&gt;pay.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask her what she&apos;ll do now.*
I have survived our enemies. You must do more than that.
Large City 2
She can&apos;t be trusted. That thing could seize her at any moment.
The cake was a gift from the Doctor, a powerful figure in Arx.
And as it so happens, Lord Arhu is missing. He is the Keeper, and only he may grant permission. If you wish to pass the Path of Blood, you must find him.
Release yourself from your oath to the God King.
You think to stop the God King&apos;s most devoted disciple? You may have defeated me, but I am just a lamb to Isbeil&apos;s lion. She will devour you whole and roar of her victory to our eternal master.
Nice. Well, it looks like we can put an end to this matter.
*She sounds insane. You should have left her to the Magisters.*
*Like a slave?*
*Tell him about the note you found on his corpse. What was his purpose here? Who does he work for?*
Agreed.
I see you. The ritual is complete - Sarias is inside us, and the earth. Speak with Tovah.
Fuligin black and carved with delicate sigils, this key clearly doesn&apos;t just open a scullery door...
Give them my regards!
Braccus Rex, the Source King raised from the dead, vanished entirely.
I doubt anyone will be calling you &apos;comedian&apos; any time soon, lizard, but that&apos;s just as well. You&apos;re known by enough names already. Survivor. Sourcerer. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
*Fane stands before you, serenity seeping from his very bones.*
*Ask him if he knows how to gain an edge over... Mummie Dearest.*
Good. Keep me informed if you find anything. Otherwise, keep out of my sight.
You think you can get away with that?
And how dare you judge me for my actions!
Jonathan ordered Gareth&apos;s parents&apos; deaths. Gareth wants revenge. Do we help him, or talk him out of it?
Zombie Chicken Form
Gloomy Swamp
Greetings once again, stranger. Lucian smiles upon you.
Go in peace, Godwoken. Just, please, be quick about it.
Heavy and cold to the touch, these chainmail gloves should protect your hands from nicks and scratches. And maybe more.
Find Sadha
Jahan offered to improve our mastery of Source powers, by drawing Source from demons. We accepted.
So that I can talk to Zaleskar.
*Say you didn&apos;t want to leave him behind.*
Gore Pile
[SCHOLAR] *A foul creature? Look at the shadows over your shoulder. Surely there isn&apos;t a ghoul on the loose?*
She has escaped the island prison to which the Order confined her. A feat deserving a modicum of respect.
&lt;i&gt;Sheeeeeeeeeep!&lt;/i&gt;
Gift Box
*Her brow furrows. She thinks awhile. She presses her hand to her chest once, and then again, as if feeling out a sensation.*
Alexandar&apos;s command ship! This begs for exploration. I&apos;ll see you later, below decks!
The Queen of Pearls. Duna&apos;s mistress, the tales say.
He smells a Sourcerer.
Loremaster Olyvie
Send us, your children, your supplicants, a new Divine...
Bloodmoon Island
Oranges. Is that what he told you he&apos;s missing? Well, I suppose it&apos;s technically true...
*He pats the pommel of his sword - his hand still tinted with dried blood. Little doubt whom it belongs to any more.*
A large-sized potion that enchants and strengthens your Magic Armour.
*The guard leans closer to Beast, his voice tight.*
*Try &apos;monkey&apos;.*
We dub thee... Knight of the Needle! Arise, good lady, and wear your title proudly.
[NOBLE] *Tell the gem to give up its secrets or you&apos;ll smash it in a thousand pieces to make a necklace for your mother.*
Blood Stomp
Headquarters has no idea what&apos;s coming - you have to warn them!
Vampiric Terror
*Nod. He could have saved them, but sacrificed everyone else. He did the right thing.*
The &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Attributes&lt;/font&gt; panel shows the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/font&gt; stats you can spend points in after you level up. Primary stats have a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;direct&lt;/font&gt; influence on secondary stats.
Looks like Lohar is closin&apos; up shop for the time being. Now let&apos;s get movin&apos;.
Charlie won&apos;t answer questions until she gets her ball back.
With my help, you&apos;ll be capable of so much more than strumming a lute for a few gold coins.
&apos;ey, this is a good&apos;un. Now close your eyes and let it wash over ya.
This statue seems like a bad jest now, given the state of things.
*Hackles raised, the dog barks at the sand built up beneath the building.*
*The turtle look up to you. You swear you see a teardrop in the corner of its right eye. Do turtles... cry?*
Cow&apos;s Secret Chest
Moving items and skills out of your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Hotbar&lt;/font&gt; is only possible if it&apos;s unlocked.
Affinity: -1
Pillar of Amadia
One day he decided he would not change back.
Stand down while you have the chance.
*The eyes flash black once again, and she unleashes a feral hiss.*
*With a contented click, the tenth tumbler falls. At long last, the lock yields to you with a silvery sigh. All the treasures that lie beneath the door are now within your shaking grasp...*
You undersell yourself! The roster of those who&apos;ve stood up to the Magisters and lived to tell the tale is a short one.
This is elven business, not mine.
Cranley Huwbert
Lucian blesses me in his own way, red-sunburst. I glide on his breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
An intricate primer mechanism for creating traps.
I have your blood. You are mine. NOW YOU DIE.
*He shoots you an odd look, then barks a laugh and shakes his head.*
Can you blame me?
Liam wants us to return with proof of Garvan&apos;s death.
