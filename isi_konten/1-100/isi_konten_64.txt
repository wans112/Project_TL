You&apos;re not another bloody pilgrim, are you? The city&apos;s swarming with those tight-fisted bumpkins as it is...
You see, I need someone who can handle themselves in a scrap. The item&apos;s within a crocodilian nest on a beach nearby... I&apos;ll mark the position for you...
Can you feel it, cousin? Can you feel the darkness approaching?
So much for Divine Order compassion.
I live here, silly. You don&apos;t. I need to think about this.
*Tell Exter that you do not yet have a method of defeating them.*
Spirit of a Charred Lizard
*She looks up at you with glassy eyes, wiping her tear-streaked face on one brocade sleeve.*
*Contemplate his words and say you like the sound of them.*
M-Mordus? He- he was here. Locked away, waiting for Lohar. Then-
Possessed Rogue
*Move a little closer and tell her she need never be lonely again.*
Lucian the Divine, champion of the Gods, sacrificed himself to save Rivellon from the Void. His son Alexandar now leads the Divine Order.
*The man glowers from under his hood. You glower back. You can&apos;t see his eyes, but you know they are trained on you.*
[VILLAIN] *Tell her to look you in the eyes. Hold her gaze - smooth, calm, and confident.*
*Tell her the groom&apos;s name is... Paul... son. Paulson.*
[ELF] *Say you should hope not, if they (whoever they are) wish to remain undigested.*
We&apos;re nearly there...
&apos;Hide in a barrel, ya fool!&apos; I yelled. And what do you know: he did!
*Two Black Ring wargs - heaving, stinking mounds of gristle and malice - play like puppies with a large crimson gem.*
Are you proud? Proud to stand in the way of justice? Proud that you&apos;d allow Voidwoken to raze the land? &lt;i&gt;Proud of your wrongs?&lt;/i&gt;
I don&apos;t want your money. I just want what&apos;s mine.
That&apos;s it, I&apos;m done with deities. I&apos;m not going to be anyone&apos;s pawn.
I&apos;m a businessman. I can&apos;t say I always keep thing on the up-and-up, but I don&apos;t think a rogue pirate&apos;s got a lot of room to judge a man for his various... trade concerns. And what Justinia&apos;s cookin&apos; up ain&apos;t so good for my bottom line.
[JESTER] *Ask about the terrible smell.*
*The machine churns into life - gears rotate and pistons hiss from somewhere within its metal housing...*
How... DARE YOU?! I am Princess Zenthia of the Firelands, you dog! Bow your head, or I&apos;ll have you burned alive!
Mug of Wine
Take this! A carapace of your own, to protect you from dangers great and small.
*Tell the little boy to go home.*
Then what happens?
Oh. Well I hope you&apos;ll come chat sometime!
You may not believe me, but... what I did, I thought I did for the sake of my people. &lt;i&gt;Our &lt;/i&gt;people. The sinking of the Peacemaker. The Driftwood smuggling operation. The Deathfog. All of it.
May your blessings flow freely.
*Another?*
How bitter to think she is like you. How hateful to know you are greater. She is but a limb, a branch where once there were many, but you: you are &lt;i&gt;the heart&lt;/i&gt;.
If he&apos;s not here, he might&apos;ve gone back to his house by the barracks.
Ah. Of course. Of course! Silly me. I thought - never mind. Good luck to you. And... and goodbye.
You&apos;re Jahan. The demonologist. I heard you could help me.
Hmm. You ever meet a true philosopher?
*Let the spirit go. You think you have the information you need.*
Criminal!
*Monsters don&apos;t get mercy. Strike him down.*
ACTIVE
*Tell her you&apos;d like her to stay behind.*
We need to get closer - then maybe I can sedate her...
It is real and it is all about us. It is the pale face caught in the corner of one&apos;s eye that makes us turn around in sudden terror of the unperceived.
Critical Chance
Smoky
*Note that he seems... enamoured with that troll.*
Braccus, the clever dog. A &lt;i&gt;trap,&lt;/i&gt; he set. It&apos;s held me until this day, with naught but this fine coat for company.&lt;br&gt;
What took you so long? I&apos;m ready to take up arms if you are.
There&apos;s &lt;i&gt;got &lt;/i&gt;to be a way off this island.
Painting of Duna
*Tell him they&apos;re hypothetical horses, they won&apos;t mind.*
At least this voice was outside, not inside. Good to mix it up now and then.
Squeezing Gloves
*He gives you a long, hard look.*
faded from memory, forgotten by the world.
*Let the creature finish its mission.*
Sure. The very best.
Unless we destroy it, there&apos;s no guarantee it can&apos;t be used again. Can we take that chance?
Pillar of Zorl-Stissa
You may do well after all.
Then... there&apos;s nothing left here for me, for anyone. The Magisters will come back - evil always returns if it doesn&apos;t get its way.
*Relent and give her the Soul Jar marked &apos;Gratiana&apos;.*

But in their name, so many guilty ones.
Rat
Aww - you&apos;re makin&apos; me blush! Truth is, a captain&apos;s only as good as his crew. But we all share a common goal: freedom. The dwarven people, we&apos;ve been through a lot. We deserve it.
[HUMAN] *Tell him your kind have got to stick together.*
Armour: Chainmail
But I suppose you do have a point. If they are dangerous, we will simply have to be more dangerous. And if they fear, we will prove worthy of their dread!
Ricochet
*Reach out to take his hand. With someone else in charge of divinity... there&apos;ll be more time for the two of you.*
You &lt;i&gt;have &lt;/i&gt;to tell me.
I managed all the interesting ones, though. You&apos;re welcome.
Now that the big acorn is here, the squirrels will inherit the realm! Bow before me, slave!
Looks like trouble ahead. The Divine Order kind of trouble...
You&apos;re not a real Sourcerer neither, Mary-Laine.
You have returned too early, dear Fane. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
*State that Braccus&apos; axe is always in his left hand.*
Acid Spores Skillbook
*Refuse the calling. Tell Gareth you are no Godwoken.*
*Leave.*
With the help of the half-demon Malady,
You don&apos;t know when to stop!
Amulet of Paradise
Hah! Go on, mate. See how long you last in here without someone at your back. The Sourcey types are out for human blood. That includes yours.
[JESTER] *Mock him - he should have seen his face! Tell him &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; you&apos;re with Lohar.*
*Cup her breasts and kiss them.*
It&apos;s about the queen. When the crackdowns and decrees came, I defended her. But this new plan of hers... I want to believe it, I do. But something&apos;s not right. She&apos;s in trouble, I am sure of it.
*&apos;Protect her...&apos;*
That&apos;s presumptious of him, but go on.
[ELF] *Nod. And what do the whispers want?*
You killed the Dreamers, didn&apos;t you? You lie!
Dress Rehearsal
Invitation only I&apos;m afraid... *HIC!*
Hey! What do you think you&apos;re doing? I need to see your pack!
The tigers fly, the leopards lie, and you... and you... Oh! But I know you, don&apos;t I? I have seen you in the night. The woman with a demon&apos;s heart... Just a dream, of course. Just a dream.
It will take a great light to drive out this manner of darkness. A great light indeed.
*He exhales; a long release of pure relief.*
You can&apos;t wriggle free from justice!
*No, although you will see what he &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;have.*
Look at this wreck!
Who can join your game?
Make it stop. Make the ringing stop!
I do so long to see my palace again. The Forbidden City... The scents of spices and incense; the sound of sitars in far off rooms.
Farewell, then.
The Divine&apos;s sacrifice did not buy peace. The rise of the Voidwoken brought the world death, destruction, and fear.
*Beast flashes you the dirtiest of dirty glances - but stays his weapon. His anger, however, is hardly held at bay.*
Ruins - Exterior D
RUN!
*Of course, but you&apos;d like to know why they strung her up.*
*He scratches his head.*
Go.
Grateful to the new Mother, Saheila told me that I need to claim Divinity for the good of all elvendom.
Guards
You killed me... You killed me... You killed me...
They were erased. Destroyed utterly. We seven were all that remained.
Like I said before: didn&apos;t exactly feel like a kiss.
We stole the Source from the Soul Jars. The necromancers are gone for good.
Thank you for your help with that &lt;i&gt;thug&lt;/i&gt;. Our kind are few here. We must help each other.
&lt;i&gt;Anathema will be mine.&lt;/i&gt;
[ELF] *Tell them this was why one didn&apos;t dabble with Scion magic.*
I care not for elven intrigue.
Flee Combat
Turns out my daughter&apos;s new husband isn&apos;t just close to broke, but close to stupid, too. He&apos;s put a contract out on my head - &lt;i&gt;as if my death wouldn&apos;t at all be suspicious on this particular day.&lt;/i&gt;
Sadist
Challenge Won
*The inner workings of the machine grind and tremble like it&apos;s about to &lt;i&gt;blow&lt;/i&gt;...*
These are a cat&apos;s toys. Lord Arhu is known for his affinity with cats.
Fang
Well, maybe&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;can turn you into a satisfied customer!
Not that it matters. It is but a small sacrifice to make in return for the fulfilling of the prophecy that is the Red Prince.
If you don&apos;t see me, blow the whistle.
SOURCE is a scourge, a devil, a misery, a blight, a hex, a curse. And yet, the CURE is...
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you&apos;re his new captain. Order him to stow the bell.*
[1] restores Magic Armour after you recover from [2] or [3], and restores Physical Armour after [4] or [5].
I got there years ago. The important thing to remember is: &lt;i&gt;keep looking up&lt;/i&gt;. I didn&apos;t do that. I spent too long wallowing in the muck.
No, Tyrille!
That creature? Yes, I am all too familiar with his wickedness. Thankfully he has been dead for many centuries.
In death, I was... I was given a chance. I made a decision. One that I have &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; regretted.
Hah. Guess we can enjoy the quiet when we&apos;re dead.
*He grins and hands you a drink, full of good cheer.*
*Inform her that you found the egg, but it broke.*
Oh hullo there. A fine day it is. And the finest day for a wee saunter through the trees it is too. Not even any Voidwoken left to spoil it!
&lt;i&gt;...with the she-elf.&lt;/i&gt;
[BEAST] *Smile. You will see to Justinia&apos;s future safety. You owe her - and him - that much.*
*Fight to contain your passenger and ask how the Eternal how it knows all of this.*
There must be something around here... something we&apos;re missing...
*Admit that you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going to do yet, but you&apos;ll try your best.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve learned how to make the potion she requires.*
*The spirit of the stag stares up its own severed head mounted on the wall. It lets out a mournful bellow.*
Foggy Night
Bad luck to let one a&apos; them cross your path.
Grants you the power to blend in with any environment as if Invisible.
Kettlehelm
Throw a grenade into the air where it will explode into six multiple balls of fiery mayhem and rain down again, dealing [1] or creating fire surfaces in a [2] radius.
Boiled Stardust
*Admit you&apos;re not sure who this spy could be.*
*Ask him who he is.*
*The boy beams like the summer sun. You see some of you in him, from a simpler time when the future looked bright and endless.*
We stole the replica of the Second Passion of Lucian from the Cathedral.
The body&apos;s covered in bite marks. What a way to die...
I need to heal. Please, if we are to make it to the Well of Ascension... I need your blood.
How are you? Don&apos;t answer that, I&apos;m just being polite.
