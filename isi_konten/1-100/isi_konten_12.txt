Glad to have you with us, adventurer, for however long you&apos;ll stay.

*The spirit waits in fear of his unknown fate.*
*The spectre floats despondently, shimmering faintly in the dark.*
Love conquers even divinity.
Arena of the Ages
*You rise from the altar, brushing dust from your robes. Your guards and the priests of Vrogir watch you expectantly. You nod - Vrogir accepted you.*
*Say it&apos;s all the more reason to destroy the queen.*
*Say you&apos;d like to enter.*
You let her die.
Blood to blood. Earth to earth.
Reaper&apos;s Coast lies nearby, mistress. When you are ready to sail elsewhere, I shall bring you there.
*Mention that his paintings sound fascinating - you&apos;ll have to go and see it for yourself.*
*Look at the dead elf at your feet and say the situation seems to be reversed.*
Rocks ahead, Cap&apos;n! D&apos;yer hear me?! Hahahahaha!
*Hold out your hands and say there&apos;s no way either of them has been near anyone else&apos;s pocket.*
So, I&apos;m going to go ask.
*Ask if she knows of a way off this island.*
*Wrinkle your forehead. Do you know each other?*
*Shout in surprise. Braccus Rex - evil incarnate!*
(I told you not to trust her.)
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;. You have earned your reward.
You tryin&apos; to keep me from havin&apos; a nice moment for a change? Alright, alright. Let&apos;s get movin&apos;. These knots&apos;re not untyin&apos; themselves.
You know me a bit by now, I think. Enough to know I&apos;m prepared to follow a good leader; enough to know I believe in teams, in crews, &lt;i&gt;in people&lt;/i&gt;.
Its brains may be rotten, but some intelligence remains. It hopes that if we walk free, it shall see the sun again.

Well get on with it then, why don&apos;t you? I thought this was an urgent matter.
Back again?
*Tell him you&apos;ve fought Voidwoken before. You won&apos;t be afraid.*
We found a journal written by Lord Arhu. It seems that he has been having doubts about how Lucian instructed him to prevent anyone from entering his Tomb. He seems to have been at a loss regarding the late Divine&apos;s intentions, and wondered what he would do if he saw what became of the world in his absence.
*Sadha... She&apos;s pregnant with your children, but they will be the end of all lizards. &lt;i&gt;Agree to kill her.*&lt;/i&gt;
Medium Fire Resistance Potion
*The Meistr sits back in her chair, golden eyes glittering at you over steepled claws.*
Well, no-one could touch that boy&apos;s heart but the Divine. Not me, not his mother, not even his closest friends. He had faith. That&apos;s rare these days.
*The colour wells back into the Magister&apos;s cheeks, and his wounds knit together into solid flesh.*

Well, well, well. This is, as they say, it.
*Stare at her blankly. What does she mean?*
*Smile to yourself, then walk away.*
*You approach the still body, and see its nostrils flaring. Long-dead eyes rise to meet yours.*
*The machine sputters and sparks. You sense a whiff of - burnt metal?*
Combat Abilities
You cannot strike me down - I am Sworn!
*State the truth: you have seen many a battle in recent days. Few ever survive.*
I&apos;ve given you eyes that can see Source. Now you need the teeth to take it.
*A group of Magisters circle an elf, weapons drawn. The hound barks to draw their attention.*
and soon became emperor.
This may sound a bit odd, but bear with me: How satisfied are you with the movements of your camera and characters?
Through a black mirror, a disfigured elf mistook us for Lone Wolves and demanded to know our Godwoken kill-count.
*She gives you a long look, then relaxes. The blade moves back an inch.*
*Ask what the Magisters have done to him.*
Being leashed by the Order &lt;i&gt;once&lt;/i&gt; was quite enough.
Nemesis Devourer
I travelled to the demon&apos;s home plane but left with my business unfinished. When I face the demon, he&apos;ll be at full strength.

*As your hand passed through the ghost, you feel its fear flow into you. You feel its confusion. You feel...*
*Snarl!* You! Sourcerer!
Hah! Look at you. How&apos;d you get that red skin, lobster? Sit too long in the sun? Or do you paint yourself whore-red every day because you think it makes you look special? What else makes you special, lizard? Your eensy, weensy -
*Laugh and tell him to hold his horses: you were only kidding.*
*Tell them you think they should go &apos;consort&apos; with themselves... or with each other.*
Cute. Takes a whole lot more oomph to get a rise out of &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; though.
You want supplies, you speak to my better half. She&apos;ll set you up.
You say that now. But who knows what adventures and redheads life will throw at you.
Hmm. If I&apos;m going to open this, that water&apos;ll need to be drained somehow...
Elf Citizen
Sanders told us that Lord Arhu was the Keeper of the Cathedral. Perhaps the toyseller has more information.
*The door has been sealed shut. The Magisters have nailed a notice to the door.*
Magister Ellwin
I knew Lady Amadia as one of my lords, but here she is a goddess. I learn much in my short time on this sand-pile.
This looks like a page torn from a cookbook, splotched with sauce and singed at the edges.
I&apos;m Malady. And you&apos;re...
Tribal elves may have recently passed through the farmlands north of Driftwood.
You buy an early grave, thief!
I can restore Anathema to working condition - but this is only half of it. We still need the blade. How fortunate that the hilt has already told us where to find it. Bloodmoon Island.
The cellar is accessible via a button hidden on a wall, behind a painting. It reveals a hatch that Meistr Siva&apos;s code will then unlock.
*Her mouth remains closed, yet her voice settles in your mind like a damp fog.*
*Beast presses his hands on your cheeks and gazes into you.*
ARRRRGGGHH!
Got a reason to be sneaking around like that?
[DWARF] *Kneel and pray. &apos;Anvil be my altar, hammer be my offering...&apos;*
*Ask the spirit to remind you where he said he left Brannt.*
Hey! It&apos;s you. Well, well, well, we meet again. They told me you&apos;d mosey your way down here eventually.
It&apos;s their fault I&apos;ll never see Ma and Pa again.
Good morning, Gill. Hey, this is my lover. Lover, this is my friend Gill.
Of course, for us to do that, we must avoid being eaten by the servants of the Great Acorn. And that is where our big, foolhardy shield comes in.
There is hardly ever a &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; for gratification, but we pursue it nonetheless. Now to take my leave - gratified.
*She shoots you a dangerous smile, all teeth and peril.*
Thank the Seven I have Aldus to guide me in these times. He allows me to borrow a bit of courage from him when I need.
Dodging: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
*Tell her that bloodshed - even of these creatures - brings you no pleasure.*
This is &lt;i&gt;Art!&lt;/i&gt; Not some gaudy painting to hang in a boudoir!
&apos;Harmless.&apos; Heh. A harmless meadow may be cursed by Void. Every ripple in the sea could signal an attack.
*The figure is locked in pose - the victim of a terrible curse.*
[OUTLAW] *Grin widely and tap your blade against your teeth.*
*You&apos;ve heard enough. He&apos;s a dead man.*
&lt;i&gt;Keep going, Lohse...&lt;/i&gt;
*You listen closely, but while you think you&apos;ve heard similar utterances in the past, you cannot make sense of its words.*
*Wonder if she isn&apos;t forgetting something? Words that rhyme with &apos;Tank Hue&apos; maybe?*
*The Red Prince&apos;s spirit stands silent, contemplating the waves as they lap against the hull.*
Heh. That&apos;s almost cute.
*Insist her plan can never come to pass. Without Justinia&apos;s go-ahead, who would release the Deathfog?*
Mysterious Fabric Dye
This Magisters&apos; protection is a hardy shield burnished to a high shine. It didn&apos;t work so well for its last owner.
A little dramatic for someone without lungs, don&apos;t you think?
*Ask what may cure its affliction.*
*Roll your eyes, but keep your mouth shut.*
Patients. Didn&apos;t pay their bills. Put them out of your mind. We have more important business to discuss.
Aye. It was, so it was.
Ugh! It won&apos;t come off!
The Advocate
I&apos;d be shocked if I hadn&apos;t already heard. At least he died doing what he loved: dying.
Vicious Bite

I always knew you&apos;d end up down low, lower even than us nobodies in the rank and file. The higher the climb, the louder the splat when you fall.
[SCHOLAR] *Inform the creature that it is sadly mistaken - it was established at the Synod of Uthul Gor: the Seven are Gods. How else could they have created the races?*
Book
Gods&lt;i&gt;damn&lt;/i&gt;. What manner of creature lies to a dead man? You &lt;i&gt;bastard.&lt;/i&gt;
No entry! How many bloody times do I have to tell you?
*She smiles and quizzically tilts her head.*
*Say it sounds like she was only interested in helping you for her own benefit.*
Tell me, Your Majesty, do you know what it takes to force a succubus into submission?
*Tell her you are passing through and are curious about this place.*
You shame your kind, Godwoken. &lt;i&gt;Leave!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say the mouthwatering combination of cinnamon and nutmeg.*
This rotten foot should clearly be six feet under.
*You both sit down, cross-legged; knees to knees, hand in hand.*
Naught wrong? Reds say jump and they ask how high! Naught wrong, he says! Blimey! A disgrace is what it is!
Local
Who might you be?
Water Ooze
Step back, &lt;i&gt;hunola!&lt;/i&gt; The time of mortals draws to a close. We have returned to claim what is ours. We have returned to claim the world.
You think we fall that easily?
*Ask who his boss is.*
*Demand that the chest open in the name of the Divine.*
A requisition for Magister food supplies.
I guess I forgot to say that being rooted also means I&apos;ve given up on the dreams of freedom I so cherished as a child.
German
I shall keep this egg. Who knows what might come of it.
*Reach out and rest your hand against the flickering jar.*
Ah! Captain, please let this one pass. She&apos;s a loyal disciple of the God King - a clandestine agent working against our enemies. I can vouch for her...
My secret would be far safer if I knew you could never talk again...

*You feel a tidal wave of &lt;i&gt;panic &lt;/i&gt;drown you. You try to crawl away, but claws pin you down. You look up, to see a fanged maw lunge at you...*
*His shoulders visibly relax, the weighty armour upon them settling with a clink.*
I want my mum.
