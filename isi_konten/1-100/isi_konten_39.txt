If you aren&apos;t going to help these Seekers, then keep out of my way...
*Remain silent.*
You want to craft it...? I hope you haven&apos;t fallen in with any &lt;i&gt;disreputable types,&lt;/i&gt; darling.
[SEBILLE] *Ask the rat why it thinks you&apos;re ugly.*
*Finish the sentence with &apos;very bloody awful&apos;.*
They came wave after wave after wave... relentless. Jolly good fun actually.
Water... please... water...
Then... that&apos;s all there is to say. I &lt;i&gt;won&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;be pushed aside. This is too important.
Help! I&apos;ve found a thief!
That&apos;s him. That&apos;s Roost. The man who abducted me and sold me to the Master. This is it. He knows where the Master is...
We did not return the stolen painting.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*They look quite animated for people caught plotting against their king. Ask if they raised each other?*
Piss off, Paladin scum.

*You feel his curse spreading throughout your body as your strength starts to ebb away. At the same time, the snake grows stronger and starts to pulse with a faint light.*
This is what I wanted, after all. My people are restored. My world is at least close to what it once was.
Then practice the moment in your mind, for hesitation will mean annihilation.
Try something like that again, and you&apos;ll regret it.
*SIGH!*
*Turn away.*
You&apos;ve saved others before, and you will again.
*Lie. You&apos;re sworn to Tir-Cendelius.*
Threats, is it? That&apos;s the last mistake you&apos;ll ever make...
*Say you&apos;re as ready as you&apos;ll ever be.*
*Ask about the names on her right arm.*
We didn&apos;t deserve this. We didn&apos;t deserve any of this...
If you swam your way here, I might consider that a notable triumph. But honey, I know you didn&apos;t swim. You&apos;ll have to give me something more impressive than that.

No. The only thing worse than losing them would be to lose them and not mourn that loss.
Roost Anlon. I own this place. I&apos;d ask you to introduce yourself, but I already know who you are, &lt;i&gt;Fane&lt;/i&gt;. Or do you prefer being called &apos;Godwoken&apos;?
See this uniform? That makes me and Tatcher here &lt;i&gt;Magisters. &lt;/i&gt;Not waiters. Get me? Good. Now, get lost.
Back so soon? Changed your mind about teaming up?
*You are asleep in your family home when Roost&apos;s people steal in like a plague. A hand over your mouth, a hurried journey through the forests. You won&apos;t tell Roost how to find the others. The end comes quick.*
I miss Joe.
History will remember the end, but not the means.
I wish you great luck, dear one. Go. Flourish. For all of us.
*mmm* skieeeeeees did aim *hmm hmm mm*
See to it you stay out of trouble, alright?
...so unless you&apos;ve no more grievances to air...
After everything we&apos;ve been through - after everything we&apos;ve seen... here we are. Here I am. And now that I see godhood before me... I know what I have to do.

*You&apos;re nervous. Ask him about his favourite memories of your journey together so far.*
*Report that you saw a highly suspicious individual over in the Fish Factory.*
Yes. The thieves take my spores, but my armour is &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; the spores. It &lt;i&gt;finds &lt;/i&gt;them.
There&apos;s a soul inside. A soul we could absorb, and its power along with it...
*Ask him why they triggered the Deathfog so soon all those years ago.*
No mother should know the death of a child...
*She blinks out more tears, then rubs them away with the back of her hand and puts on the bravest of faces.*
It spoke to you, Sourcerer. The Voidwoken. &lt;i&gt;I saw it.&lt;/i&gt;
*Decide that Matis looks like a good choice - his axe seems fearsome.*

Amazingly, one of us had never killed, stolen, misdealt with the soul of another, nor served the Void. Pure, they passed the Path of Blood.

Aww. The strapping warrior&apos;s as weak as a kitten. There there. It&apos;ll be okay.

Salty Water
I had no idea she would&apos;ve gone to such lengths to help us. And now I can&apos;t believe she&apos;s gone...
Sickly-making-me, you do...
*Ask him if it hurts to see his liver being clawed apart.*
*Say that actually, he doesn&apos;t sound all that smart to you.*
Though I guess it wasn&apos;t all bad. I met you, after all. And look at everything we&apos;ve done...
Game Field
*Say you&apos;ve heard there have been a string of murders against Magisters in Driftwood. Ask if he knows anything about it.*
*You spent the night together, but yours was an intimacy of the mind, not the body. Hours spent in conversation.*
*He bursts out laughing, full of good humour after your night together.*
*Say you&apos;re no Sourcerer. You&apos;ve never even met one!*
Migo&apos;s Ring
Get away from me, you Lone Wolf scrubber.
Did you accept your new status with humility,
*Mutter that maybe you both got hit on the head a little too hard in that last battle.*
*You turn, steadying yourself on the corner of the building... to see an elf standing mere feet away. There&apos;s something in her hand, gleaming in the moonlight...*
Happy landings.

I thought no-one cared. I thought no-one cared but elves and bears. This gives me hope, this does. Lotsa hope. *Sniff.* Thank you.
But I fear for their very lives as long as I&apos;m threatened by the God King!
*Ask how to set the spirits in the armour free.*
Yeah ok, you found me out. Go on and git and maybe I&apos;ll sing you somethin&apos; when I&apos;m good and ready!
*Shrug your shoulders and sink your teeth into the black, foul organ.*
Greedy little goose! I am not a fool, my juicy morsel. I&apos;ve built up my hunger while you were gone... and they always say that hunger is the best sauce.
Please, make sure all of them cheat death today.
Not sure. Think it&apos;s so&apos;thing to do with the old ones and so&apos;e kind of ro&apos;-iss. Guarantee, is what I &apos;ean to say. Don&apos;t ask &apos;e &apos;ore than that, though. &apos;cause I don&apos;t know.
No. I can&apos;t risk their lives again. I&apos;ll wait here. Come to me when you have a wand in hand.
But interesting!
Become Divine.
We offer sanctuary, Sourcerer. I&apos;ll mark a safe place on your map. Come when you&apos;re ready. Friends await you there.

I&apos;m not about to surrender Brannt that easily. Now, off with you.
*Turn away.*
*Keep the ring for yourself. Bid him good day, and walk away.*

*Tell her you see her - Malady. No more or less.*
Ya ain&apos;t even won in the arena, and ya lookin&apos; to tangle with that warty beast? Ya should just drop that idea like a mouldy potato.
Eurgh! This flesh is well past ripe... whatever memories it once held are now gone.
*The nurse rubs his hands together in glee at the sight of you. His palms are slick with some oily substance.*
Ah. Terribly sorry- I mistook you for a guest. It was my daughter&apos;s wedding today.
Never mind. Here you are. Safe and sound. Where you belong.
The nature of my lesson though, might be somewhat different from what you expect. I can deepen your bond with the Source, but you must realise that this bond comes at a cost.
Even a spinning compass points north some of the time. Maybe the Magisters are right.

I know you do, Lohse. I know this is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; battle above all, but if I&apos;m successful you&apos;ll be free to claim your divinity...
*Say an Enchanter would suit your party well. She ought to stay as she is.*
I&apos;m sorry to be so brutal about it, but I&apos;m compelled to notice your hairless face, complete lack of tail and whiskers, your ridiculously long legs and your unusually smooth skin.
*The guard pauses as he takes you in. You brace yourself for an attack, but he either doesn&apos;t recognise the infamous Beast - or he doesn&apos;t care.*
