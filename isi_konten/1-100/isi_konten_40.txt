The House of Shadows stirs, sire. Assassins had me cornered. And so I took the last, desperate action left open to me: I fled bodily into the dream realm. This is my world now. To Rivellon I can never return.
You have earned... nothing.
*The earth churns beneath you. Skeletal arms surge from the ground and ensnare your legs, squeezing tight.*&lt;br&gt;
*Demand to know what was going on here.*
Two-Handed Cleaver
Arx is still a free city, last time I checked.
Yvette&apos;s Key
The Magister flagship, the Lady Vengeance... s-she&apos;s anchored at the old harbour. Once the way is clear, we&apos;re to take her, and get the hell out of here...
Hat
I t-thought we w-were dead f-for sure! T-thank you!
FIRST: You die. THEN: Your precious Roost.
Driftwood is the same as every other fishing town. It&apos;s got the same aroma, and the same herds of unwashed dwarves. No offence.
Undeniably so, Your Majesty, but there is a vast difference between what is and what could be; between mere romance, and reality.
Yes. Please ask.
&lt;i&gt;Do &lt;/i&gt;be sure to rest before venturing out. You shouldn&apos;t roam the graveyard with a fuzzy head and an empty belly. You&apos;ll be prone to... &lt;i&gt;hallucinations.&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s just wood and straw and glass. You still have family. You have me.
Deploy Mass Traps
Paladin Jost
Another inmate, but you wouldn&apos;t guess it. Runs this place like he&apos;s Dallis herself. Shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find him in the kitchen, but he doesn&apos;t take too kindly to &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;kind.
Continue your quest, Source Hunter!
The madness will return - I won&apos;t let myself become a danger to you... farewell.
Wavering is a sign of weakness, so make your choice and stand by it!
*Grin and say that you don&apos;t actually have the ability to consume the Source of spirits - but you doubt his God King will be all that pleased that he helped you.*
Oh, dear. I wasn&apos;t expecting visitors.
*Tell him you want to hear more about what happened at the barracks, before he ran.*
Deliver us from this agony!
*Tell him the truth - they were murdered by the cook in the tavern. Promise him she found justice.*
Dallis&apos; motives remained unclear. Was she an agent of the Void? Did she serve another? Did she seek power herself?
Saheila thanked us for freeing Amyro.
*Say you&apos;re interested in learning more about the nature of the island.*
Wailing Mandrake
Do try to relax. The harder you fight, the harder the experiment will be on you.
Greetings again, mortal. Is there nothing more important for you to do than disturb my rest?
You speak. The word. I open.
Didn&apos;t think one of your kind&apos;d have it in you. Well done.
*Ask about her compass.*
[OUTLAW] *Grin - you&apos;re not sure about a hornpipe, you&apos;ve been threatened with a hangman&apos;s jig before.*
*Kick it.*
Cannot die from damage and won&apos;t die when lifetime runs out.
Fran the Bicorne Hat
*She&apos;s old now. Withered and hunched, grey hair falling over failing eyes.  She turns to you and dips her head, sending you on your way with a smile that warms your soul.*
Monsters in the deep... *gasp*... the world is dying... world is dying...
At least let me tell you what happened - then you can decide.
Crafting Materials
He made it - he made it past the flames!
I swear I hear murmurs from within, but with the Void so close, I&apos;m not sure I might trust my own ears. But I dare not enter: Lucian insisted no-one set foot within his tomb, and I have done his will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet I wonder each and every day: am I right to adhere so strictly to his words? Can there be good in denying his resting place to a grieving people? Perhaps he couldn&apos;t know the chaos that would come. He will have presumed Alexandar would follow his guiding his light. If only he could have known...
Hmm... I usually only display completed works, but well... this painting&apos;s raw power is already plain to see - here, feast your eyes...
You did it? You really did it. Then the way is clear... we can move forward... are you ready?
[DWARF] *Growl that the time of you kicking his arse will begin if he utters another word against dwarves.*
Snakes grow out of your head, giving you a Petrifying aura and the Petrifying Visage skill. Incompatible with Bull Horns.
Livewood Shield
From what I gather you&apos;ve a certain... mystical quality about you. A penchant for the surreal and the visionary. There can be no doubt that would place you in...
*Protest. You bought that from a local merchant just the other day!*
Very well, traitor. Side with your mortal pets. Share their fate.
They are Godwoken too, and may be courted by the lesser six. But you will be a god, none other. Smile at your fellow wanderers, but ready your knife, for its time will come.
We told Lohar what happened to the caravan.
*Like a devotee?*
*Tell him you&apos;re not answering his damn questions. Take your leave.*
I choose my own friends. You are a stranger. Now please - I must return to my work...
Rest in peace...es.
*With twinkling eyes visible through his helm, the reaver offers you an apple. Shiny and red, it is perfect in every way.*
Challenger of Autumn
Source attracts Voidwoken. Voidwoken bring &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;. As long as Source is contained, the Voidwoken will remain at bay.
Yow are with the God King or yow are against. There&apos;s no standing back here and now. &lt;i&gt;Which is it, scum?&lt;/i&gt;
[1] Shadow Damage
Bastard thought we were little more than drug mules.
Helm of Divination
Critical Hit!
Houndmaster&apos;s Room
&lt;i&gt;Alexandar&lt;/i&gt; knew. &lt;i&gt;Lucian&lt;/i&gt; knew. I was nothing but a pawn.
*Think for a moment, and tell her you probably would.*
*Ask what he meant by &lt;i&gt;&apos;ancients&apos;.*&lt;/i&gt;
As long as the House of Shadows approved.
Scions say the same. &apos;Not me, not me, you&apos;ve got the wrong one.&apos; Reflex, I guess.
*Tell him we all deserve forgiveness. We all have the potential for divinity.*
Schematics
Why my lady, you smell... divine. Do you eat cheese?
&apos;All the people ask him where he left his crown...&apos;
Before no man... Ha! But before a god?
*Say that you just offered up a prayer.*
Replenishing your supplies, Monster-slayer? An excellent idea. There&apos;ll be more Voidwoken to slay before we&apos;re done, I wager.
This bloodied limb is evidence of the Hammer&apos;s ruthlessness.
Dying to hear them.
*She laughs as she looks you right in the eye, pointed teeth glinting in the candlelight.*
Oh, we&apos;ll find something. My intuition never lets me down.
I never managed to meet with a Dreamer in Fort Joy so there&apos;s nothing for it I suppose, but to search this land for a kinsman with the sacred gift of dreams.
A contract for the killing of Divine Bishop Alexandar.
I&apos;m not so easily purchased, thief. You&apos;re under arrest.
*Enquire about the Path of Blood.*
I&apos;ve heard such stories myself, whispered among fellow soldiers at camp. They are no myth, clearly.
...I might be persuaded to spare you. &lt;i&gt;Might.&lt;/i&gt;
*Give the spirit an incredulous look. You don&apos;t hear any howling.*
Uru Vorr
*Say you&apos;re a realist; it&apos;s better for &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;to escape than &lt;i&gt;none.*&lt;/i&gt;
The hoard of a dwarven hero.
Only rather more vigorously.
Well, my friend, if you tire of the current recitation, my talents await you.
Been awhile since I had one of these in my hands. I wonder if I can still play...
*Ask Zimski what he&apos;s trying to draw.*
Magister Carver
An ancient and powerful ring.
That&apos;s not good. Better track them down before they get themselves eaten. Or worse...
He will bow to me, just as his men did. You will &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;bow to me.
[UNDEAD] *Feign fear. Oh no! That sounds horrible!*
Sealed Door
...I am getting to the point, Quercus. The point is the path ahead is dangerous.
Rotate Character Left
Spattered Trousers
*Ask where the spores had been sent.*
*You remember stumbling upon a book that mentioned Death Heralds - this altar was used for the cult&apos;s initiation rites.*
[UNDEAD] *Accept, but croak that pleasures of the flesh are beyond you. The voice of your god whispers encouragingly inside your skull.*
Well. That relationship always &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; complicated, wasn&apos;t it?
*Bitter. It&apos;s the only word that comes to mind when you try to interpret the spirit&apos;s expression. The ruin encircling her is mirrored by her enraged face.*
Yes - you could be an asset. Very well: You can find my helpers - the Thieves&apos; Guild - within the Arx sewers, in their so-called secret hideout. Here, I&apos;ll mark it for you. But approach carefully; the foul stench is hardly the sewers&apos; gravest danger.
Well, that&apos;s... something.
It&apos;s times like this that I &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;paint! The drama, the violence, the &lt;i&gt;sheer emotion&lt;/i&gt; of it all...
*He contrives to look even more pitiful... but then a grin breaks across his face.*
Oh! You thought you might turn the tables, did you? Such naivety. Almost charming, really. But we had an agreement. The tablet is &lt;i&gt;mine.&lt;/i&gt;
Of course I wouldn&apos;t! What good have bloody dwarves ever done for anyone? Now answer me! &lt;i&gt;Why are you here?!&lt;/i&gt;
A noble gesture from a warm soul. You redeem yourself, child. Sleep well, dear one.
Sure. You just keep demon dreaming.
Vacuum Touch Scroll
While there are certain unsightly bulges in your clothing, I doubt you are hiding an entire boat in there.
What a lovely little trick Dallis uncovered. It makes them so... compliant. So willing. My playground has never been more flush with... pleasures. She&apos;ll be glad for the advancements I&apos;ve made. No-one likes to play with a zombie, after all. A modicum of will must remain, or where&apos;s the fun?
*Nod along. You can understand his reasons.*
We fight for our lives, as we fight &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; our lives. We fight the Black Ring on the side of the Divine. But Lucian betrays us. Lucian sends us to our deaths.
*Lie. Gareth has suffered enough. You&apos;ve found nothing unusual.*
Those spores she was gibbering about. She carried on like I&apos;d stolen her damned spawn.
...Perhaps not &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;like you. But I heard the call, and came here to face the trials of the Gods...
This could be the last of him.
*He shakes his head with disgust.*
*Bend down to the dirt and copy the looping whorls he&apos;s drawing.*
You have returned here too early, Beast. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
*She grins at the sight of you but quickly puts on a hard face.*
Hey. H-h-h-hey. You left before I got to tell you the thing.
Heavy Sabatons
*The man&apos;s wide eyes flit from one object to the next: the desks, the candles, the floorboards. He is in inexplicable awe of it all.*
Gye Fallchard and Lawre Godfray fell in the last melee. The Voidwoken will be back, be sure of it. Beyond the bridge the world has gone to hell. The Magisters are out there now, hunting down a Sourcerer.
*Call out to the Magister. What is this woman&apos;s crime?*
[The brittle pages of this volume are filled with notes written in the elegant hand of Jahan. Some of these entries date back more than a thousand years...]
Sure. That&apos;s the kind of contract some Lone Wolves accept.
That I have, sir! Thank you, sir! Bred and trained for service I am, sir! And proud to be some help! Sir!
Absorbed: [1]
Oh, I see your ache. I can weave some tapestries, but &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;I cannot touch. Even a Divine cannot repair all that we want mended.
But of course. Please, carry on, oh dedicated leader.
*Point at your own chest. Who, you? You&apos;d never dream of causing trouble!*
I see your triumph, Lohse. If you are strong, you survive. If you are weak, it consumes you. If you are weak, it consumes... &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt;.
