Our true leader has returned and united us. It&apos;s nothing short of a miracle he&apos;s made it this far - he&apos;s dodged assassins more than once.
*You are taken aback and ask how she knows about that.*
[FANE] *You&apos;re not so sure about this. You&apos;ve spent rather a lot of time with yourself already...*
I avoided an eternity of pain and suffering.
I wished to meet you face to face, to fulfill an age-old dream. I have waited so long!
Didn&apos;t always seem right. I watched you back in Fort Joy, &apos;n&apos; felt that pull. But I shook it off. I&apos;m a free man, dammit. Can&apos;t let some stud get the best of me.
Raw Slice Of Meat
You let me know if you change your mind.
Decomposing Necromancer
*Bid him show you the way into the cavern depths.*
*Ask why you&apos;d even consider working with him.*
*Stay. Might as well stand guard in case anything goes wrong.*
*Ask what he means: Rivellon&apos;s history is still there.*
He was an ancient dragon, long since fallen. Yet his bones retained great power, and she sought to unearth them.
Welcome, mysterious guest of Isbeil. *Winks*
Is that... wait. Really? They&apos;re gone?
I didn&apos;t show any more t&apos;you than you&apos;ve shown to me. Besides - the Order needs someone to lead them for the long haul. I don&apos;t need Divinity to do what&apos;s right for my people.
The flames are extinguished! Thank you.
Looks like everything&apos;s accounted for. Now the important question: Who&apos;s the thief?
*Grin. Say he&apos;s got the jist of it.*
Berry
Eagle
Weapon Upgrade
Damn it, hurry up! I can feel the fish oozing &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;.
Divine Order Paladins asked us to spy on the White Magisters in the Blackpits.
Even after all this... I can&apos;t return you to the God King. Take it. Be free.
*Spits.* Outta my sight.
I chose you because I knew you could bear it. I am not mistaken.
*The grip tightens to sheer agony.*
*She studiously ignores you.*
*The craftmistress stares off into the distance, so deep in her memory that she seems to have forgotten you entirely.*
*Watch to see what happens next.*
Hello, my dearest friend. How nice we finally meet.
that the world may never forget the greatest heroes Rivellon had ever known.
Mediocre Amulet
Maybe... *yawn*... I should stick to the good stuff for a while. But I&apos;ll miss the shadow.
Traitor. Turncoat. &lt;i&gt;Tattletale.&lt;/i&gt;
*Suggest that a strip search might be more... revealing.*
I&apos;m glad we&apos;re in agreement. Off you go.
*Sigh.* My final pupil is a dunce, it seems - just as I suspected. Let&apos;s see if I can do something to raise that intellect, shall we?
*Tatcher grins hello.*
It&apos;s as if I&apos;d returned to the Isle of Mist - but I&apos;ve emerged with a blessin&apos; I didn&apos;t possess before. A gift from Duna... or one claimin&apos; his name, at least.
&apos;ut there&apos;s stuff in the chest! Good stuff! O&apos;en the chest and find out!
I released the Source back to the world.
*Tell him to go on. You&apos;re here alone.*
*Isbeil clears her throat and continues her litany.*
*She searches your face for the truth. Then decides she can&apos;t afford to risk being wrong.*
Deafening Shriek
No, please don&apos;t come begging me. I told you: you can&apos;t be my slave and that&apos;s final.
That&apos;s what I said, Fort Joy. He&apos;s gonna find his mum and bring her back.
[SCHOLAR] *Wait - ask if this is a riddle? Is there another version of her somewhere that says &apos;Sun&apos;, but one of her always speaks truth, and the other always lies?*
Betrayal! Murder! Poison!
I pledge my heart, O Lucian. Please return.
*Nod along. And where is that?*
[HERO] *Tell him you&apos;ll do what you believe to be right.*
*Laugh that theft is fun.*
And what kind of Divine was Sebille, as the world battled the demons?
Take your stupid painting then. I never liked it anyway.
It was like razors in my brain. I thought it sounded familiar. But different.
*The spirit looks... &lt;i&gt;angry.*&lt;/i&gt;
All who were aboard are presumed dead.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Suffice it to say I&apos;d at least be &lt;i&gt;&apos;Captain Beast&apos;&lt;/i&gt; in better times. I&apos;m out of a ship at the moment, though. Even a salty old dog like me&apos;s got to sweat on dry land now and then.
I know you&apos;re eager to begin, but take heed: If you are to proceed through the Path of Blood, you&apos;ll need to know how.
*Ignore her.*
Clay-filled Bucket
Stew
Advanced Party Management
A shame it has to be this way. I was&lt;i&gt; just &lt;/i&gt;getting fond of you.
*The dog lies there quietly, clearly in great pain.*
I intend to raise the subject with him.
Sebille&apos;s Bloodthirsty Amulet
*Bow your head and say you&apos;ll mourn her too. One day she&apos;ll be buried in a palace rose garden, honoured with daily chants.*
Oi, what ye got there? Me capn&apos;s coat! Only one way to deal with a thief.
Gift Bag #4 has been automatically downloaded and applied to your game. We hope you enjoy this fine collection of modifications inspired by our community favourites!
*Give it a stern look.*
You were thinking of flesh, or to be rather more precise: the pleasures of the flesh. Those that have eluded you for so long...
No, Lohse. I&apos;m not a little songbird as easily caught as your good self.
YES! Er... Hmmm. Of course. I cannot deny you, prince, whatever my reservations. Let us partake...
*The spirit suddenly looks up at you, eyes wide and accusing.*
*Deny any responsibility, but add that you&apos;re seeking to further your knowledge of Source.*
We&apos;ve found Voidwoken and carnage, but no White Magisters.
Descended from the Hall to deliver the dead to Rhalic, they say.
I do hope word has reached home. We must evacuate, before even more tragedy befalls us.&lt;br&gt;
I pray you&apos;re more idiot than mad dog. It would be a shame to expend all this effort just to see you put down.
*Tell him that you know what he did to that woman. Now he&apos;s going to pay for it.*
Godwoken.
Source Platform
Perfect.
*...and you realise this is - or was - the ghost&apos;s reality. He was a guide; his job - to know the way.*
His grave looks out over the sea.
I think I&apos;ll call my next song &lt;i&gt;She Who Struck Fear in the Gods&lt;/i&gt;.
Supercharger Skillbook
*Apologise for what happened and say he shouldn&apos;t have had to see that.*
Be wary and stand tall, Seekers, for we hold madness captive.
*He pauses, considering your question.*
Are you ready for what&apos;s next? I know I am.
You&apos;re not alone. Lots of fighting here. Fighting each other. Fighting their demons. Fighting...
We will redeem Rivellon! As for you, well... I am erasing you. Your bones will be embers, your existence forgotten, your future cancelled.
*Wonder why he cares about this at all.*
Cancel Changes
Believe it when I see it! But hey...
Centuries. &lt;i&gt;Trapped. &lt;/i&gt;
*He crosses his great, burly arms across his chest and scans you with his good eye.*
Undead Lupine Horror
Leave me!
What is does ripple is my temper!
The bridge is off limits. Away with you!
You&apos;ll need both hands to hold this sword aloft. Better make sure you don&apos;t need them for anything else.
You must gather your party before venturing forth.
Not here to chit chat with the likes of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
Well, well, well, look who&apos;s here. Think I wouldn&apos;t recognise ya without your wig on, didja? A son never forgets his own mother&apos;s face! Isn&apos;t that right, Dad?
Embodiment of Tir-Cendelius
Lohar, eh? Well then, you need to talk to my colleague inside.
[IFAN] *Cold of heart and voice, tell Lucian he must atone: for his lies, his betrayal, and the death of countless innocents.*
*Admit you&apos;ve been waiting for this to happen again - the Voice of Flame is here.*
Think we could sell its hide? Could make a fortune.
My friends heard my war story. To save the elves from the Deathfog, I took them a portal device. But I was too late. I failed my people.
But before you begin, a word of warning. I gather that you travel alone?
[The paper is singed almost beyond legibility, save for the repeated mentions of the Divine that can be seen.]
*Draw your needle. Say you want &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; answers, not hollow justifications.*
Icy Skin
There&apos;re also matters pertaining to the queen. But ain&apos;t no use nattering on about &apos;em.
Summon Condor
It&apos;s the Doctor! HE&apos;S BLOCKING THE PORTAL!
Teleporter Pyramids
*No sooner than her words are spoken than her spirit disintegrates and scatters on the breeze, until there is nothing left of her. Nothing left at all.*
Poison Dart
And what kind of Divine was Lohse, as the world battled her demons?
Ryker&apos;s pets Cottontail and Dot are arguing over who their master loves best.
Silver Ring
The Harbour
Oi, don&apos;t think I ain&apos;t watchin&apos;! That&apos;s your fifth Blue Jester this round!
Dot&apos;s Collar
[FANE] *This creature seems to be technically minded. Loudly wonder if she could fashion a face-ripper for you.*
Careful with that thing of yours. I bite back.
Ain&apos;t just praise yer earnin&apos; though. Givin&apos; you this key, too. It&apos;s an arena champ tradition. Takes ya to treasure, it does. &apos;n only a champ can survive &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;journey.
We put Reaper&apos;s Coast and the wrecked caravan behind us.
A Summoner&apos;s Lament, Volume Two
He&apos;s a Godwoken too - a failed one, as far as I&apos;m concerned... I can imagine he won&apos;t want any upstart Godwoken taking what he figures to be his birthright...
I wonder who that was. Oh well. She&apos;s in a better place now. And her sacrifice served a very good cause. But please, let Lohse lead here. This place is her burden. The task is hers.
*Mabel gives Geraldine a side-eyed look, then sighs.*
Course I am! You really think the Divine&apos;d destroy the entire elven homeland?
*She nods a greeting.*
*The spirit of a lizard is seated before you, &lt;i&gt;weeping profusely&lt;/i&gt;. She looks up at you, moist-eyed.*
Scimitar
Dungeon - Underground Apartments B
Oh honey. So naive. Anathema is still out there. And I&apos;m not keen on competition, if you get my drift.
Old habits, my friend.
Enough talk from you...
Granted, the recipe you know could be a little... darker than what you&apos;re used to. It would harness the power of those that you&apos;ve defeated - a grim art.
*Play along. You love roses so much, you bathe in their oils and draw their likenesses with pen and brush!*
*The stone king watches over the water.*
*Accept the kudos.*
Yes.
But... I know nothing of any Verdas.
This dense axe can only be wielded by the strong of arm. The handle is inscribed Erlam though what that means can only be guessed.
And he told me to make sure she got it. He told me to ensure they got to-...
*It&apos;s a crystal blade seemingly separated from its hilt. It&apos;s clearly of a kind with the object you recovered from the Surrey tomb.*
*Hannag the Sourcerer looks at you in surprise.*
When we were in Reaper&apos;s Eye, when I saw those tomes and scrolls, I was...myself again. For a moment, I was alive.
[UNDEAD] *Ask about his travels. Has he ever been to a place where the Undead walk free?*
Kabu the Honeybear
*Silence. The hatch doesn&apos;t budge.*
Erma, mummy&apos;s right here! Where are you?
Freedom&apos;s so close... we have to set sail.
*The Sourcerer waves goodbye, and you note the rope burns on his wrist from where he&apos;d been bound and hanged. At least his mark is only temporary.*
*Saheila? Say you met her daughter while you were in Fort Joy.*
Hafted Axe
*Ask how the Path of Blood came to be.*
*Her hand lies limp in yours. She&apos;s too weak to stand.*
Shh! Hold your tongue.
*Take a closer look at the puppet.*
