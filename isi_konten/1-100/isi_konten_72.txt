...Lucian alive I&apos;m coming for you I&apos;m coming to kill Arhu I&apos;m coming to seek you and kill the Seekers I&apos;m coming Lucian I&apos;m coming Lucian alive Lucian I&apos;m coming coming coming...
*You&apos;ve heard of such portals; they are rare creations of the House of Dreams, leading to planes where dreams manifest as reality. You&apos;ve never seen one yourself, however - until now.*
*Pluck a book from the shelf.*
*Ask why he was left behind.*
*She stares at you as if you&apos;re mad, but then looks deeper into your eyes. What she sees there terrifies her. Her throat constricts further, and she backs away in horror. Job done.*
Living on the Edge Scroll
*Tell him a Battlemage is just what you&apos;re after.*
Navigate Local Players
Stay outta trouble now. I&apos;m more&apos;n happy to lay down the law if ye *hack!* try anythin&apos; funny.
[SOLDIER] *Say you obey generals, not bishops.*
In truth, it does not matter in the least who you really are. You saw me mark my prey. You could warn him, save him, or kill him before I get my chance.
A crumpled note that is greasy and sweat-stained from close proximity to a fearful Magister named Borris.
This delicate ring is a token of your bond with the Red Princess
*The majestic rooster flaps his jewel-coloured feathers menacingly at the tiny chick, as if he were under threat from a dangerous beast.*
Those. &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt;. Worst ones I&apos;ve ever seen. Ripped through the Magisters... the dwarves... dead dead dead. And the Sourcerers, Sourcerers &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;...
Not seen. &lt;i&gt;Heard&lt;/i&gt;. There&apos;s a man over there. They tortured him. Questioned him. &apos;Seekers,&apos; something about &apos;Godwoken&apos;. He didn&apos;t know anything, but they didn&apos;t care.
Spider-Woven Gloves
I always thought my path was laid out. &apos;Become Divine, preserve what&apos;s left of your people.&apos; It was such an easy narrative.
Apparently the situation is resolved.
Undead Chicken
That&apos;s not bad as far as a merc job goes. If I see Reimond I&apos;ll tell him you&apos;re worth your price. Now get out of here so I don&apos;t have to smell your stink. Go on. Alright lads, we&apos;re moving out! &lt;i&gt;Look lively!&lt;/i&gt;
Easy enough to say in times of peace. But look around. We&apos;re standing on the edge of the end.
Tenebrium
*Step forward and tell him to release her - &lt;i&gt;now.*&lt;/i&gt;
...or there was that time we talked in the Undertavern...
*Fight, you ask - what fight?*
*Tell him you don&apos;t mean any offence. Ask if you can part as friends. Offer to shake hands on it.*
Force push a character
He refuses his duty as a dwarf, and now he refuses to face me?
Kvyn&apos;s Helm
Chipped Ring
Like all of his ilk, he is kind. He is charming. He will offer you what you desire most at seemingly no cost at all.
They spoke of a Covenant... what could that mean?
[VILLAIN] *Smile and say you&apos;ve changed your mind. Breaking a jar is less amusing than leaving a soul in torment...*
Heh, if yeh&apos;ve the skill to survive out in that marsh, might be that you can. Please, do what yeh can.
I won&apos;t forget you either, Lohse. Good-bye.
I&apos;d let you try your luck with it, but I reckon I lost it in the scuffle. It&apos;s called the Sparkler. Wins the entire pot, it does. Filched it from that hog Griff himself.
Tired of living? I&apos;ll help you out with that if you don&apos;t get out of my sight in five... four... three...
Character is very vulnerable to physical damage.
Coffee Table
Let me guess: Siva sent you off lookin&apos; for Sourcerers.
*The great tree glows with life but still radiates penetrating cold.*
Decaying Foot
[JESTER] *Tell her she&apos;s being a right pain...*
I believe you could, but it&apos;s not certain. That&apos;s a tale only you can tell.
Fighting Axe
*Reach for your weapon. There is more to this situation than meets the eye.*
Then maybe... maybe fate is on our side. Please, meet us at the harbour. It&apos;s time to get off this island.
Thirst of the Eternals
Hold, interloper. Trespasser. Self-appointed arbiter, stand fast and justify.
*Remove your headwear - just long enough for him to see your true self.*
Set AI
Ah... Ifan ben-Mezd, I presume? I am a friend. You can call me Zaleskar. Roost sent me to give you some aid in your little &lt;i&gt;errand.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask what else he has of value.*
Toggle Decal Bounds
Speak to Exter.
Feh! Fend for yourself then, big man. I&apos;ll take what I want after the Reds get to you, anyway.
[IFAN] *Tell him anything&apos;s possible, but you don&apos;t remember doing that.*
You do not disappoint. I can read the passion in your gaze, the fire that is Source and Source alone.
*She abruptly stops and faces you with a fixed, mocking smile. Her eyes remain the deepest of black.*
We arrived at what must surely be the tomb of Lucian the Divine.
*Scoff. You were hardly sneaking. Is she really so afraid of a harmless traveller in the centre of Driftwood?*
Ye ran the ship upon the rocks, Cap&apos;n, and all the crew were drowned!
*The mirror is cloudy and dark. No discernible image forms in its black depths.*
*Tell her Amyro showed you the way out. She should join you. You will protect her.*
Small Tome
Inside Braccus Rex&apos;s vault, we&apos;ve found the Soul Jar of a pirate captain that once served him.
*Say it stands to reason you want to win in the arena. The gladiators here cheat, so why shouldn&apos;t you?*
*Release the sword.*
But... could Lucian &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; this? No, it&apos;s not possible...
*Raise your voice and ask again if he can hear you.*
Are your regretting asking for my milk? That&apos;ll teach you to make assumptions.
*The wrong foot indeed. You wish he were alive so he could be killed again.*
Sweet lady. &lt;i&gt;Beautiful &lt;/i&gt;lady. Seek out our master, he wants you...
*Bid the kid farewell.*
The Merchant
The tide turns. I have no compass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Let these scribblings bring my choppy thoughts to leeward.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The compass lies in the rocky shallows, with the Peacemaker and her dead crew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bell rings a warning yet, though the wreck be many miles from here, over the hills and the bluffs. A small inlet, in the shadow of a keep, with rocky shallows afore the beach, and a draught  too low for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I walked the woods to make it back to port, through the fearful forests with their harrowed screaming and their wracking pain. I almost thanked the bell, though it drove me all insane, for blocking out the night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Peacemaker lies wrecked along the coast. Another one for the Reaper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tide turns. And I without my compass. Gods blast this infernal bell!
*His sneer travels from the restrained dwarf to you.*
*The spirit turns to meet your gaze. You swear you can feel your bones crack from a rush of heat, and you hear... screaming; the agonising cries of people, burning alive.*
*The dwarf pulls a dagger with shocking dexterity and reflexively swings at your gut. Thankfully the ephemeral blade passes right through you.*
*The lizard is not of flesh, yet you feel the weight of his arm as it collides with your palm. In an instant, you are no longer &lt;i&gt;you, &lt;/i&gt;but &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; - crouched low and concealed in shadow.*
*Laugh and tell him that was the most adorable thing you&apos;ve ever seen.*
Dungeon - Corridor
That&apos;s the Void. It&apos;s coming here. It&apos;s coming for the gods. And it&apos;ll come for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, too.
You... you&apos;ve changed. And for the worse. I&apos;ll not have the sacrifices of my fallen brothers maligned to my face. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; survived, ben-Mezd. Be thankful for that, if nothing else...
*Ask if he has any more stories. One for the... road? Sea?*
*And in an instant, the spirit of the Shadow Prince departs for the Hall of Echoes, at peace with your promise.*
Trompdoy&apos;s ring gave me a jolt. I get the feeling it wants to be worn.
But more than that, my prince, when once again you seek your throne, you shall have the support of the House of Shadows. You have earned it.
*This, you think, is what happens when the Scions don&apos;t get proper training.*
*You curse as the knife lances into your thumb, deflected neatly off one of the rough-skinned spores you and Thews took from the prisoner.*
Undead Dwarf Ranger
*Say you sometimes wonder how two such mismatched travellers have made it so far together.*
You who hears the laments of the dead: &lt;i&gt;avenge me! &lt;/i&gt;Kill the false Baran... Give me back my name...
Not too loud! What do you think the Paladins would do to us if they heard you going on like that?
Anisotropic 4x
*Ask how you can open his cage.*
Void Charger
[Translate10_a18d5ae9-697f-407b-aa0b-d515a6148516]
Abstinence. Chastity. Nothin&apos; &lt;i&gt;deviant &lt;/i&gt;about that.
*Point at her.*
Welcome, blessed one, to Amadia&apos;s sanctuary. Pray, who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?
*You are sworn to the same master. Insist he tell you his goals so you can complete them.*&lt;br&gt;
Dot

Arhu&apos;s Chambers
*She sighs.*
*Make a proposition: You&apos;ll find the stolen supplies and bring them back, and Griff will free Amyro.*
Exploration Theme 10 Light Orchestral
I know what you are. And neither of us is safe here. I&apos;ll mark a sanctuary on your map. Go - and soon. You&apos;ll always have a place at our table.
A shame he could never see past his own clouded vision. The royals came for his sister - but he still couldn&apos;t condemn them, even as they ran. He played both sides - and now bears the burden for it.
Investigate the Blackpits.
Fair Weather Friends
I relinquished my claim on Divinity and supported my companion. May the new Divine do right by my people - and all of Rivellon.
&lt;i&gt;Do you mind?&lt;/i&gt; I have guests at present. This is not the time or the place... and you are evidently &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;the sort I should be consorting with, judging by your manners.
*You drink. It burns. Soon the tears run down your cheeks as well.*
You again? Go pester someone else.
*Edden looks victorious. Tatcher looks unconvinced.*
Better judgement got the best of you, eh? Ready to make a deal?
I... I just don&apos;t know how we&apos;ll manage. We needed one of those purging weapons. A wand...
Skeletal Cat
Please. Go. Do not return. Or you &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;regret it.
Settings
Do you understand your current objective? Is it clear where you should go next?
I always thought elves would be cool, but you&apos;re so boring!
Accept
*He grins and gives you a dramatic salute.*
*He looks at you as if to say &apos;well, duh&apos;.*
Taylia has the skills you need - I&apos;ve seen &apos;em in action firsthand, and I don&apos;t envy your foes...
I &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;hear you perform at some point. But for now, I ought to carry on with what I&apos;m doing here, unless there was something else...?
Hrrmph. Think you&apos;re special or something? Too good for my verse? You&apos;re nothing but a poxy elf!
You&apos;re clearly no Magister. Garments coated in dirt. Haphazard garb. How&apos;d you come to be here?
The Mother Tree lacks kindness, it would seem. I hope his blood is on her conscience - if she has one.
Freedom feels even better than I imagined. I won&apos;t give it up again.
Giant Physical Armour Potion
Don&apos;t play her game. Think of yourself. Rest here. The sun is golden. No-one will bother you. This moment can last forever, if you let it.
I have a prize to seek. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;have your life to cherish.
Mind your own business, would you? This is a bloody private conversation!
There&apos;s a Lone Wolf out in the marshes. Sebille would like to interrogate him.
Tarquin&apos;s Death Warrant
Perhaps your body can aid the Scion&apos;s work.
*Ask him about his master. You&apos;ve been looking for someone to help you sort out the - erm - matter at hand. Head. Body.*
