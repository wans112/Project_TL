Sounds like any other plea for mercy to me: utter nonsense.
Well now. That makes two of us, doesn&apos;t it.
*Ask to hear more about how the Lady Vengeance came to be this way.*
*The Scions of our people? Say you don&apos;t understand what she&apos;s talking about.*
Orders from a Black Ring superior officer.
There&apos;s something beneath the fireplace... a mechanism of some kind.
That divine voice, that idyllic poetry. I could lose myself in Barstan&apos;s cinnamon eyes...
Want to see those red scales blackened? I&apos;m sure the Seeker could spare a fireball.
Ain&apos;t got the coin fer a poem? Join the club, brother. Not like it&apos;s rainin&apos; gold &apos;round here.
You are no Magister. No Paladin either. Resourceful of you, to breach our inner circle... I&apos;m sure Marwell must be fuming.
I&apos;d rather be a troll family&apos;s meal than to remain under the Magisters&apos; watchful eyes.
But it tickles me no end that you&apos;re sharp enough to consider that a possibility. So... hand on my heart, we&apos;re in it together, what do you say?
Alas, I think not. They have been infected by the pettiness of the mortals they crafted in their vanity.
The Doctor&apos;s Messenger
Ledge
Spirit of a Paladin Archer
Be careful around the figurehead, Godwoken. We can&apos;t afford to lose you.
Pickpocket
*He pours two glasses of wine; hands you one with a polite nod of the head.*
Loosely-Wound Vines
Mercenaries. It&apos;s a job. &lt;i&gt;My &lt;/i&gt;job.
I was famous for them, I&apos;ll have you know!
and deals always fell to her favour.
*Say you&apos;re certain Atusa will come. It&apos;s only a matter of time.*
*Mention that you found a ring in the tavern kitchen - a bloodstained Magister ring.*
*Remark that the last you saw of him, he was in a coma aboard the Lady Vengeance - what happened?*
I feel where you look...
...but you&apos;ll never get to tell anyone that.
In life, I was a wizard, as close to Amadia as a kitten to its mother. In undeath, I am a lich.   Source streams through my bones like blood through veins.
Fire Infusion
You bore me. Come back when you&apos;ve got something exciting on offer!
*...then shakes her head; you should not help. The elves send Sarias to his final resting place.*
Your Hotbar deck is full. Access the second deck if you need more space.
The very best.
Hmmm? What? You be needin&apos; something from me, lad? Ain&apos;t much inclined to rub elbows with elves if you catch my drift.
Speed at which the camera moves.
Splendid. The Black Ring has proven a chaotic element at a time when control is... imperative. I&apos;m overawed, truly.
Blessed Zorl-Stissa - an elegant God for our elegant people.
*Her lazy chortles echo off the cellar walls.*
I am sure you have many talents, Godwoken, but your ability to lick your own elbow or perform other &apos;impossible&apos; feats does not impress me.
Really? Like what kind of stories?
*She draws you in, her lips dangerously close to where your ears once were.*
Can I ask yew a philosophicamal question?
Shiny enough to attract a magpie, sharp enough to kill it.
I don&apos;t know what that means, but it sounds important.
*Tell her that you&apos;re no Seeker, but they&apos;re always grateful to those who help them. If she knows how to get this ship moving, they might look more kindly on her...*
[OUTLAW] *You&apos;ve encountered locks like this before. Tricky, but worth a try.*
*He gives you a wry smile. There&apos;s a glint in his eye.*
*This shrine fills you with a sense of peace. It is a safe haven.*
No, no. You must be thinking of someone else. My Griff is a gentle soul. He believes in the kids. He made this school what it... what it was.
There, you can prove in trial-by-combat that you are indeed, the one I have waited for: &lt;i&gt;The One&lt;/i&gt;.
&apos;How&apos; is so boring. It&apos;s the &apos;why&apos; that surprises me.
I know because he did die for me. *Sniff.*
I&apos;ve got some friends there. They&apos;re not exactly in tip-top condition. But their shelter&apos;s safer than out here, anyway.
*She sighs dramatically, exuding impatience.*
He &lt;i&gt;loves &lt;/i&gt;me, he loves me &lt;i&gt;not...&lt;/i&gt;
See how the worms crawl. Interesting...
*The dreamer remains focused on the Magister. An arcane chant rises from his gullet in an indecipherable hiss.*
Well? Let&apos;s go!
*Accept the compliment. Allow her to kiss you. Feel the fork of her tongue push against your lips. Open your mouth to accept it.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell her she smiles like a general with a stratagem. Whatever it is, you want in.*
Unfortunately, I think we do.
Isbeil! Whatever&apos;s gotten into you? Malodorous it may be, but this is still a court, not a gallows!
*Tell him he&apos;s right. &lt;i&gt;He &lt;/i&gt;should be paying &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Make to walk away.*
*Refuse to betray your companions.*
These are not just trees. They are ancestors. They remember everything. They &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;everything.
*Remark that good guys finish last.*
This chest recognises you as a liar and a poor thief.
Oh Quercus, it wants answers. As if it is the first creature to ponder the big questions of the universe.
Did you wish you&apos;d surrendered the power that runs through your veins, and sealed the Veil?
Whyn&apos;t you move along.
The spirits within are particularly feisty as well. Can&apos;t say why. I&apos;m as gentle as can be! Alas, I am stuck sniffing out herbs and fungi on the outskirts.
We stand watch nearby. Just in case.
Shinier too, I&apos;ll wager. But we work with what we have. Here, see for yourself.
*All you can see is a smear of blood on its surface and a hollow that seems to call for something...*
*The spirit ruffles her feathers and stares deeply into your eyes. You feel a powerful energy flood through you, a powerful energy that &lt;i&gt;stays with you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Magister Yona
Everyone&apos;s talking about a recent murder, and I gotta say, you have the look of a felon. If you know anything, you better tell me now.
Here lies Withermoore the holy man
The burden of fame I suppose. Or infamy. We must be on our guard.
&lt;b&gt;A relic that once belonged to a lost girl. It cannot save her from us.&lt;/b&gt;
What&apos;s wrong with that bird...?
Large? Impressive? Glowing stones? It certainly has all the hallmarks of my people.
The heart does not think - the heart decides. The good heart knows right from wrong. Follow your heart. &lt;i&gt;Set me free...&lt;/i&gt;
I cannot see this land destroyed just so we can rebuild our more imperfect world. I have a new home now.
Well - not really a ray of sunshine, am I? C&apos;mon. Off to Micheil Ros&apos; estate. He&apos;ll know where Justinia is, presumin&apos; Lohar wasn&apos;t talking out of his far-too-ample arse.
Goodbye, Red Prince. Shadow to shadow...
Valor
Why did it have to come to this... still, you have my thanks, friend. I owe you my life.
*&apos;Meistr Siva has been accused of conspiracy, murder, and high treason. She shall hang by the hands at the farmlands gallows until trial.&apos;*
To think I believed that news of my widowhood would be the worst thing to reach my ears today...
Blessed Water Arrowhead
You got a good reason for bargin&apos; into a private room, buddy?
*The all-consuming fires rage nearby, and still the spirit sings quietly on.*
*Turn away and start to retch, expelling the horrible beasts from inside you.*
*Beast growls under his breath, and slowly reaches for his weapon.*
You caught me off guard. No-one catches me off guard. Better tell me who you really are, or this time I&apos;ll let my needle do the licking.
But if I&apos;m correct, and Sadha&apos;s heart has been darkened by the Ring, you may be able to find her through their scrying magic.
[MYSTIC] *Promise that the spirits will guide him to his true purpose.*
He was poor, a voyeur, and above all a doer,&lt;br&gt;He was having a ball, but then death came to call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was rich, yet bewitched, and with fine thoughts enriched,&lt;br&gt;They all called her a doll, but then death came to call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;m not loaded, nor bloated, and not often quoted,&lt;br&gt;I still want it all. Death: postpone your call.
Seven preserve me, are you entirely ignorant, elf?
High Quality Fire Essence
I must say, entertaining despots isn&apos;t anywhere near as bad as what most people in that court did.
Blood Bubble
I&apos;ll remember that. Thanks, mate.
*He slings a quiver of arrows across his back and nods.*
But first we must avenge Saheila. There is a man in yonder sawmill. &lt;i&gt;Roost.&lt;/i&gt; You kill him for me, and prove you do the deed.
*Smiling faintly in his sleep, the man slumbers on.*
A pity they didn&apos;t just listen. All this could have been averted.
*He bows and gestures for you to pass.*
You were the key to it all.
[MYSTIC] *Mimic the creature&apos;s whispers. Perhaps you can develop a rapport with it.*
Wooden Box
I know what&apos;s at stake. But I have to warn you - this ship is alive, and dangerous.
I pray you will bless their armour so no curse may pass it.
*Tell it you want nothing from it; not Source, not anything else.*
Vrogir&apos;s Enclave
*She takes your hands. You feel a vibration, the humming of life all around you. The sensation of a hundred tiny heartbeats, the true rhythm of the forest.*
I never hear her speak something untrue. She sees what others cannot, and she sees our salvation.
This herbal brew smells faintly of wet paper. Drinking it can boost your intelligence.
With Lucian gone, the elves reluctantly rejoined the Divine Alliance. Their place in the war on the Void would entirely depend on the integrity of the new Divine.
A bit of a tight fit. No wonder nobody was wearing it.
*Smile. He really is an arrogant bastard, does he know that?*
*Give yourself over to this. There is no stopping it. You are powerless.*
Whatever motive he had was no excuse. He murdered people in cold blood.
&apos;allo!
*Hesitate. You don&apos;t want the Magisters to haul you away to gods-know-where.*
Novice
*Take your leave.*
Look about you, brother! Do you feel an all-powerful sun, or see the desert on all horizons? We are far from house and law.
*Stare in disbelief.*
*Take your leave.*
Wizard Coat
Without Kemm, we&apos;d ALL be toast.
A new king took the throne - the local brewer.
You wouldn&apos;t be in such a hurry if you saw the kind of things the Magisters are doing, the kind of things they used against us...
&lt;i&gt;*Does he realise he&apos;s asking &lt;b&gt;a god&lt;/b&gt; to be his slave?*&lt;/i&gt;
We escaped Fort Joy. Now we must get off the island.
So be it. If we must fight, my prince, we&apos;ll fight! Together we will brave it all. Even... the king.
The walls we leave behind, and a wilderness awaits. Just the way I like it.
*Let your greed overcome you. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Twohander
*Nod. That&apos;s you, alright.*
Now if you&apos;ll recall, as per your own testimony you can cook, tailor and groom: three quite indispensable talents.
Endless Runner
until the war with the demons began.
*As you near the garden, the rustling of leaves and branches turns to an insidious murmur. The closer you listen, the clearer the whispers become.*
He has told me his plan, dwarf. Lucian will not wash our sins away with water or fire, but with Deathfog. The true faithful will bathe in the fog of their own accord, and he will reward them with eternal bliss.
*Greet him with a pretty phrase. You&apos;re pleased to make his acquaintance.*
Lately I&apos;ve been into the Enchanting arts, but I can shoot, slash, summon, steal... whatever your little black heart desires. So what&apos;ll it be?
more powerful than ever,
Lies. I could cut out your tongue for it...but I have a better idea.
