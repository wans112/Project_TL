You... met her? Really? How was she? Was she healthy? What&apos;d she say? What&apos;d &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;say? How did she seem?

On Dwarves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*In a long and occasionally rambling tome, Huwbert waxes lyrical about the Dwarven Kingdom and its increasingly large diaspora - whose existence and at times precarious situation be blames squarely on the dwarven royals - all the way back down the royal line to Tenax himself - and their combination of reckless hubris and feckless strategic incompetence.*

*You lose control.*
Hah! If there was a cave to explore, do you think I&apos;d tell &lt;i&gt;you?! &lt;/i&gt;How funny that you&apos;d think I&apos;d answer to a lizard&apos;s pet. That&apos;s what your scar means, doesn&apos;t it? You do tricks on command and sleep in a kennel, isn&apos;t that right?

*Plant the idea in his mind that this will turn out to be for the best.*
*Laugh loudly. Wipe your eyes and tell him nothing good lasts, after all.*
Please. It&apos;s all well and good to caress cold bone, but it just feels so... empty.
*Mention that you helped some Magisters and Paladins fight off Black Ring forces at the Temple of Rhalic. They&apos;re tending to their dead before regrouping.*
*Push the weapon away and take your leave.*
*Whimper.* Arx. The barrels were going to Arx...
I&apos;m not saying I&apos;d question Lord Kemm&apos;s decision-making, mark me, but it strikes me that right now we&apos;re getting nowhere fast. A change of thinking might help.
Take care of her. Cure her, if you can. My task here is done.

Huwbert lists many examples of what he considers to be a summoner’s doing. He believes that the power to summon is in some way connected to the Source within you and your ability to master it. (Huwbert admits he does not know if the chicken was seven feet tall or had seven feet, but postulates that given the fact that the chicken was invisible, the question is academic.)]

*The Seeker throws a toxic look at the imprisoned Magister.*
This? This was a reward... for doing my duty, for fulfilling the wishes of one Braccus Rex. Do you know that name?
Don&apos;t know about it. I didn&apos;t either, &apos;til the one over there got me into it. These ol&apos; ruins make a right fine battleground.
