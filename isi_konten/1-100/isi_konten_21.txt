Then I die. She dies. We all die. Never mind. Go.
hoping to find the wife he&apos;d lost.
*Ignore her question and request that she recharges your Purging Wand.*
Cursed Oil Infusion Skillbook
Defeat the Advocate.
*Reach for the shark, ready to drag it into the water.*
Those. &lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt;. Worst ones I&apos;ve ever seen. Ripped through the Magisters... the dwarves... dead dead dead. And the Sourcerers, Sourcerers &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;...
I&apos;ll give you a moment to let that sink in.
Yeah. No. Bye.
*The child ignores you and continues with her game.*
You can put a price on the warriors I have for hire, but you can&apos;t put a price on the glory they&apos;ll win you.
Used to be I had a family. A husband and a little boy. We were healers. Source was in our blood.
*You kneel. Sebille places her hand upon your head. The instant she touches you, it&apos;s as if you grow larger; as if your soul expands with life beyond life.*
*Tell him you want a cut - you&apos;ll take half of his earnings. Call it the dog&apos;s half.*
My thanks.
It would be a mercy to kill these Seekers now. There&apos;s no saving them.
*Tell him he looks ridiculous. Did he get his disguise by trimming a horse&apos;s tail?*
*The elf tilts his head backwards, but his squinted eyes don&apos;t stray from yours.*
I be the guardian of me capn&apos;s flagship. I&apos;m what stands between dross like &lt;i&gt;ye &lt;/i&gt;and his life&apos;s work.

*Step away from the egg.*
Well. Okay then. Moving swiftly along, for an insignificantly small sum, I can introduce you to the greatest lizard lover the world has ever seen. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Sigh* Trust you bloody-minded beasts to turn a child&apos;s trinket to a wicked purpose.
I would have! *Cough* Of course! But alas, I have none...
Finesse is a condition one should assume in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; situation, from dining to discourse to duelling. What situations do you have in mind?
Our plans were in disarray. Dallis thwarted the ascension of a new Divine, while the God King and his legions grew stronger.
*He steps back and passes his gaze over you, his face impassive.*
And so, you have what you came for. It is time for you to depart. Leave this place, Godwoken. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
Second Skin
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*...you realise you hear the music too...*
Large Intelligence Potion
Hope you don&apos;t have to make any choices like that too soon.
*Hold tight to this memory. Just a moment longer...*
*The creature seems to be trying to pull its lips apart. The infected holes through which they&apos;re stitched together strain but do not stretch.*
*Rue that many of her comrades were killed.*
*Growl that he&apos;s already caused immeasurable suffering thanks to his pogrom against Sourcerers - he&apos;s not fit to be a saviour. Not fit to be Divine.*
I went to Paradise Downs to teach a young Sourcerer. Gwydian. But the Magisters came for us. We fought them off - and our Source drew Voidwoken. *Shudder.* You may blame the Magisters for the horror.
Ye can thank me sister for it. Were a band, we were: The Whistlin&apos; Warriors! Least, we were &apos;til I got shipped off. We&apos;d serenade music-lovers and toleraters from the kingdom and beyond.
Spirit of Ryker
I saw Rivellon overrun by monsters - Voidwoken creatures that destroy all in their path.
*You stare in shock: it&apos;s speaking perfect Old Tongue. You&apos;d have no idea what it was saying if you weren&apos;t well-versed in the Empire&apos;s ancient texts.*
This &apos;Covenant&apos; of theirs didn&apos;t do them much good. Onwards.
It&apos;s strange, Godwoken. How much I thought I knew, but didn&apos;t. How sure I was of the path Lucian had set me upon. How sure I was of &lt;i&gt;me. &lt;/i&gt;Of what I was capable of... and what I wasn&apos;t.
Got a customer, Lovrik! Where&apos;s that shiftless layabout lurking now?
You know, if you want to add some razzle dazzle to your own gear...
Use [IE_CameraZoomIn] and [IE_CameraZoomOut] to zoom in and out.
We shall have justice. We shall see you cast into the Void!
&lt;i&gt;What? &lt;/i&gt;The armour speaks - but you are too &lt;i&gt;loud.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That cat in the garden... &lt;i&gt;Arhu&lt;/i&gt;...
Didn&apos;t you hear me the first time? Put your weapons away!
*Say that you know nothing further.*
I&apos;ve got to hurry. The ship won&apos;t stand up to these flames much longer.
What&apos;s up, god.
*Tell the rat to watch its tongue or you&apos;ll cut it out.*
Food? Protection? I have neither.
Don&apos;t do that! &lt;i&gt;Leave my darlings alone!&lt;/i&gt;
They didn&apos;t die quietly. How... satisfying.
Ain&apos;t seen a sight so unnervin&apos; since I left the Isle of Mists. The Gods are losin&apos; themselves to the Void - if they haven&apos;t already lost.
Hmm. I have a thought.
Hmmm... You were in a cellar with other Sourcerers. As everyone lay sleeping you lay awake thinking of someone back home. A very special someone.
*GROWL!*
Gareth is back! Gareth is safe!
*The cat eats the fish in a few seconds&apos; time, then looks up at you and gives you a groggy meow.*
Nobility
Um, yeah, I know. Why do you think I brought you down here? I want you to help him.
I am the heart of the Deathfog... the destruction of faith...
Captain Malady stands at the ready!
Am&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;cream?
*Say that you want to try the recipe he gave you - where can you brew it?*
*Explain that if he is skilled enough to take out Magisters, surely he&apos;s skilled enough to sneak out of a rickety fish factory.*
Oh, you poor thing. If there was a cave to explore, do you think I&apos;d tell &lt;i&gt;you?! &lt;/i&gt;You really think I&apos;m going to answer to you, don&apos;t you. We both know who&apos;s really in charge, don&apos;t we?
He&apos;s down there now, guarded like some precious jewel rather than leashed and flogged like the dog he is...
*The creature turns to you. It&apos;s so hideously ugly it&apos;s almost beautiful. You feel like it&apos;s trying to grin, but it looks more like a snarl. It looks towards its jailor, then back to you.*
UI Scroll Up
Now, what poem would you care to hear? An old classic, or an original verse?
They think to honour me. Instead, they incinerate me.
*Claim that he is most perceptive. You are in fact a lure - tasked with drawing true Godwoken out of hiding so that they can be killed.*
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry, but you have other matters to attend to.*
No offence but I&apos;m safer alone. I&apos;m small. Quick too. I can take care of myself better&apos;n anybody. Used to it by now.
Chapter 6 - The Hunt for Dallis
&lt;br&gt;N O W&lt;br&gt;Y O U&lt;br&gt;D I E !
None of your beeswax... less you got a &lt;i&gt;reason &lt;/i&gt;to be here?
I know what you&apos;re up to. Now cut it out!
*Ask why she would destroy herself.*
You... you&apos;re a Sourcerer! Stand down!
Ready! We&apos;d probably get tired of this view soon enough anyway...
*Accuse him of lying about the Deathfog.*
Physical and Magic Armour
*The spirit will choke for all of eternity...*
As I said, the Magisters left me weakened... but this will help give me the strength to carry on my work.
The pain&apos;s getting worse...
Together we can do it. You can right this wrong and restore the Eternals. Please, Master Fane. Set us free!
*Bellow at Alexandar. He must explain himself!*
*It is &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt;. The secret of your soul. The goddess knew her, and Brahmos knows her too.*
Cut
Incandescent Decapitator
Little faith, little reward. Of course it will be worth it. Serve with faith and obedience, and you&apos;ll see.
I&apos;ll take your order if you&apos;re polite, elf.
[BEAST] *Without a word, in absolute privacy, tell her you too know the salt of tears - sometimes seemingly enough to fill the sea.*
A foolish choice, to return. Beyond this point, death awaits.
Do you know what it means to have the power of the Divine, Godwoken?
There is little more to do, then. I must go... and so must you.
This - this is...
*Get serious. You can&apos;t believe she&apos;d fallen so far...*
*A flash of the needle. With lightning speed Sebille spears his hand. He howls with pain.*
*The bewildered ghost stares at her own dead corpse. A single thought emanates from her spirit; &apos;But I was &lt;i&gt;pure.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*She gives you a defiant look.*
Yet without Lord Arhu&apos;s co-operation, she would have to pass the Path of Blood to gain access. And thus far, no-one has survived the attempt.
I came here with the Seekers. It seemed like a good idea... until the Magisters sunk their ship. Some of them are skulking about in the Swamp even now, somewhat worse for wear.
*Say you&apos;re surprised to hear her talk like this. She seems passionate about the state of the world - why?*
Forced... but a killer still.
*Threaten to smash a few faces if you aren&apos;t let go.*
Oh, but darling, no need to tense up so. I&apos;d never do that to &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Draw yourself up. You know all about the contract on your head!*
Hrm... it seems someone has taken liberties with your lock!
Hold to Send
Time has a habit of running out...

Please. Leave me be. It is a long and difficult day.
Then I suppose you aren&apos;t leaving, darling.

*So he and Sadha have become the father and mother of dragons. You don&apos;t know whether to congratulate him or fear him.*
Shrewd Belt
*Pay the toll.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
My good fellow, what are you waiting for? The experience of a lifetime awaits upstairs, and the door to you is open.
We stopped the execution.
*Stay still. It&apos;s dark here. Familiar. Safe.*
Amyro died before he could help us with our escape.
Ian Vandalheart
*Tell him you&apos;re glad to have established which of you is most desirable. Then walk way.*
So that&apos;s what we do.
Good girl.
*Tell her to take responsibility. You&apos;ve been alone too - it&apos;s no excuse.*
Put the amulet on and charge it up by consuming Source. Once it&apos;s got five charges in it, it&apos;ll be ready to go.
Lucian, wait your turn, I shall devour your soul anon. Now &lt;i&gt;you, &lt;/i&gt;who dares interrupt Braccus Rex...
*Tell her you&apos;re still waiting for someone...*
*What was that? You &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; you heard something.*
Saheila told me to claim Divinity for free elvendom.
*As you approach, Amadia greets you with outstretched arms, though her face is marred by a pained grimace.*
Perfect dwarven craftsmanship, right here.
The Merryweather sank and all aboard are seemingly lost.
Arguing with Mack is like giving medicine to the dead. He&apos;s as stubborn as a corpse, and smells the part, to boot.
Chocolate Cherry
I am nobody&apos;s tool! You never really knew me at all, did you?
A single drop of Source magic...
That&apos;ll be up to him, won&apos;t it.
Argh! The Queen! It&apos;s the Queen!
The talented fletcher Corbin Day was kidnapped by the Lone Wolves. Freed, he might make a useful ally.
*Tarquin sighs.*
*Ask what he was doing here.*
War&apos;s a-brewin&apos;, my friend, and I&apos;ll stand by your side. But prices will go up, even for one of our own. Buy now and buy often!
Doors
Of course, a victory is a victory. Even if it comes at a cost.
*Ask the spirit if Voidwoken caused his death.*
*...and you are thrust back into reality. The memory fades, but you still sense the Source the man has commanded - as if you&apos;d possessed it for yourself.*
*Take your leave.*
Mean Troll
My Enemy&apos;s Enemy is My Friend
Thank you, Gareth. We can&apos;t wait to go home.
*Growl...*
Resets the default values for the sound settings.
&lt;i&gt;Always&lt;/i&gt;. I haven&apos;t forgotten what I&apos;ve heard about the chef&apos;s mastery of the pot and cleaver. I&apos;m simply waiting to have it proven to me.
*Growl that Lohar sends his regards and draw your weapon.*
