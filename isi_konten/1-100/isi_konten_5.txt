...the doctor... sees no-one...
Bloodied Note
Return to Farimah the gravekeeper.
*The spirit successfully fends off whatever was attacking him - only to immediately fall prey to you.*
We just don&apos;t work together. You&apos;re not my kinda people. And evidently, I&apos;m not yours.
Help
That is very much the &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; answer.
*You pray to Amadia, yet no words from you rouse a response.*
I feel... why, I feel... it&apos;s indescribable. I... I am so deeply in your debt. Thank you.
But although they did not join the Divine Alliance, many joined the fight against the Void,
Arx has hardly been good to us. Why should we be good to it? Release the Deathfog.
*Stand firm.*
The mysterious Black Ring leader known as the &apos;Sallow Man&apos; may be of use on my quest.
Well - that&apos;s that sorted. Time to move on, Lohse. No doubt more await.
These shiny bracers are flexible but not flimsy, sturdy enough to withstand any storm or skirmish.
*The bird stares at you for a long moment...*
*Suspicious, he examines the document. On realising it&apos;s real... he hands it back, then stands to attention.*
Chicken Attack
Ghostly Morningstar
*The skeleton is quickly leafing through a volume of Cranley Huwbert&apos;s famous encyclopaedia, muttering to himself.*
That poison-peddler? A swamp frog is a more potent warrior. Let me show you the power of the King&apos;s true chosen!
I go to Linder Kemm.
*The spirit vanishes soundlessly.*
My favourite one.
Sorry! Dance card&apos;s full. I&apos;m sure my pal will come pick me up any minute now...
*Ask him how he can enjoy the weather in his current condition.*
You must rehearse that speech for a long time. I&apos;m no-one&apos;s fool, you know.
*Ask what she thinks your next move ought to be.*
*Her laughter echoes like fading cathedral bells, ringing out a world of beauty and despair. You turn away.*
Ngh!
That&apos;s right. And you&apos;ll stand in theirs. What happens after that is entirely in your hands.
Report on Arhu &amp; Kemm
Barricade
*Whisper in the Red Prince&apos;s ear: play along, he may know where Sadha is.*
Dead Bull
Metal Scraps
*Tell the warg &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; fight by her side.*
Ah, my amulet is glowing with Source.
Blind eyes... shine brightly...
Politician
Thanks, but no thanks. I see enough horror every day around here.
*The spider taps her spindly leg on the sandy floor, as if in impatience. You could swear she just rolled all eight of her eyes at you. She&apos;s clearly trying to communicate, but &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;can&apos;t understand her.*
Come. Come to... me.
*Ask how he feels now that the deed is done.*
*Tell him your own travels have thinned your purse. Any chance of a discount?*
J
[RED PRINCE] *Say you&apos;ve no real use for gods anyway. You&apos;re your own god, always have been.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve heard from Tir-Cendelius... reasonably recently.*
Then let me shake your hand and describe your target!
I know I chose right. Should Lucian snub me in the Hall, as you snubbed me in life, my pride is still mine. I am prepared for him to rebuke me; it is the price of loyalty.
[RED PRINCE] *Say that you value your rightful place in the Ancient Empire.*
I want to leave Arx. For a long time I want to leave Arx... but Hervett says no, and I cannot go without Hervett. He and I are one.
*Tell him that you&apos;ve passed the Path of Blood, and intent to continue on to the Tomb of Lucian. Does he intend to stand in your way?*
Get yore soft arse to the camp and report. Do it now.
*Agree that humans are a rather arrogant and bloodthirsty sort.*
God above, what I wouldn&apos;t give to get a move on.
Fluorite
Be brief.
*About the Cathedral...*
There... there was a reluctance in my heart. A lingering doubt. To be Divine is to shoulder a great responsibility. Deep down, I didn&apos;t want that responsibility for myself.
You have them. And with that, I shall leave...
Shh. I... I see the Void even now. It stalks me from the shadows. It won&apos;t rest until... until...
*Grin and say that you know enough to keep your mouth shut.*
That&apos;s it. Go on.
*Leya shakes her head and returns to her sulking.*
*Ask the item to explain itself. What else can it tell you?*
*The spirit of the Knight prowls the chamber, spoiling for a fight that isn&apos;t coming.*
Unlock the hatch.
I thought I would rather enjoy it. It had been so built up in the books of your people, but...
Ah, to choose just one from such a vast ocean of possibilities.
Ryker turned on us.
On the Godwoken&apos;s command, Malady brought the elements down to snuff out the candles.
Spends most of his time tinkering with toys nowadays. Such a pity - but that&apos;s the price you pay for genius, I suppose.
*Ask the most urgent, most pressing question: who is he?*
We all have our demons. Lohse is allowed hers.
You are... unique.
[BARBARIAN] *Tell him he&apos;ll pay you or you&apos;ll kill him. Simple.*
This mouth will tell you nothing. If you want me, come and &lt;i&gt;find &lt;/i&gt;me.*
Havoc
Medat&apos;s Blood Rose Notes
[LOHSE] *Say that you value control. Something it seems he&apos;s not too familiar with.*
*Hiss* You&apos;re not the thrall I&apos;ve been promised, but you might be something to practice on until he arrives...
Well, the log was wrong, you idiot!
There&apos;s something odd about this ring. More than a simple pledge of eternal love... it appears to have been carved for some specific purpose, like a key.
Drinks
You shouldn&apos;t surprise me like that. I could&apos;ve sliced your neck clean open.
I&apos;d thank you, but it seems &lt;i&gt;someone &lt;/i&gt;has already thanked themselves, by the state of this lock.
Brewer
&apos;The Black Bull Tavern&apos;
You sure you&apos;re not looking to buy anything? I prefer banter when it&apos;s with paying customers...
*A faint sound catches your ear - the rasp of metal upon leather. A sword unsheathed. The spirit&apos;s eyes &lt;i&gt;bulge &lt;/i&gt;with panic. She raises her arms protectively...*
What do you think they&apos;d do with ultimate power?
You&apos;ve grown enough, despite yourself. You&apos;re ready to travel to the Well. When the time comes, you &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;do what it takes. You&apos;re a survivor, no matter what stories you tell yourself about what you can and cannot do.
I can&apos;t! I swear, O merciful lady, I swear! Only the Master can, but no-one finds the Master. No-one ever finds the Master.
Would you put a knuckle in it? I&apos;m trying to concentrate.
Accusing him of murder, the Magisters were trying to burn a suspected Sourcerer out of his house.
Found In
Most we can hope for now is some peace in the Hall of Echoes.
*Ask him for the magic word for the chest.*
I can&apos;t pickpocket this. What was I thinking?
*The child smiles. She starts tracing small shapes - hearts and stars and diamonds - into the dirt.*
Source Point(s)
An entire history, lost and buried.
I&apos;m glad to hear you survived the sight. You may not be so lucky a second time.
*Say you&apos;ve never heard of him. Should you have?*
We are at war. Whatever she&apos;s done, her knowledge of Magisters, her power, their power - they could mean &lt;i&gt;everything. &lt;/i&gt;I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; make her speak.
*He sniffs at the fish, then bares his teeth, ready to sink them into scales and flesh.*
Musical Instrument
I&apos;m not some footsoldier, you clod, I can&apos;t put myself at risk! We&apos;ve lost three of our number to this Higba fiend so far - I won&apos;t move from here until he&apos;s in a cell or in a box.
We smashed a Soul Jar and angered the pirate captain within. It seems his essence wanted to stay in the jar.
*It wants a magic word! Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;dwarf&apos; and &apos;cave&apos;.*
Are you sure you want to flee combat?
*Tell him you realise you&apos;ve offended. Apologise; you make jokes when you&apos;re nervous. If he doesn&apos;t like it he can always stick his fingers in his ears... oh.*
Keep yourself out of trouble, brother. You don&apos;t want to find yourself in &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;one&apos;s place.
*Tell her you&apos;re not too keen on hearing any trees in your head.*
You again... you haven&apos;t seen Wainslow since we last spoke, have you?
[IFAN] *Grin and say that what&apos;s &apos;fascinating&apos; is his lack of survival instinct.*
You can be better than her. Greater than her. But you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; accept.
*Roll your eyes and say that you don&apos;t have time for her post-existential crisis - yes, she is &lt;i&gt;dead.*&lt;/i&gt;
Come play, you say. This ought to be fun...
*He was looking for this Anathema the whole time? Tell him to forget it. He should have been honest from the start.*
My love for you, my child. My love for Rivellon.
You should never leave someone behind.
Cage Open
Coat of Talent
He&apos;s still the same man he always was. He just needs a real friend to remind him of it.
*Tell her the truth: You met Zorl-Stissa, and she told you that Lohse was a liability.*
*Ask how he wound up here.*
I&apos;m not here to bandy words with you, girl.
Yew Longbow
Well - it&apos;s not like the old days just yet. But at least the riff-raff is gone. I hope they took the head lice with them.
*Your casual dismissal of his insults seems to unsettle him somewhat. Uncertainty sours his face.*
*She stares back. Harder.*
*Fury envelopes the spirit&apos;s features. His roar echoes around the chamber, even after he is gone.*
Do I... &lt;i&gt;ungh&lt;/i&gt;... do I sound like I&apos;m alright?
Now drop the act, sit yourself down, and make yourself comfortable. First-rate entertainment, this is.
That... didn&apos;t sound successful.
I&apos;ll be lucky if anyone hires me to guard an outhouse after today...
Troll
Ya almost had me there, lad. Hehe.
Ingredients
*The girl&apos;s spine suddenly arches back at an unnatural angle. A squeal of distress morphs into a deep, throaty chuckle. She straightens and looks at you. Her eyes are black.*
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present to you the Eternal mystery, the Seed of Divinity: Fane.
*Ask him what he means.*
Composite Bow
Of course. Why would the Seven kill him if they could throw him to the Void? If they could throw them all to the Void...
*The current twists and tears at you, battering you against the ship&apos;s cargo. You hang on until a small box comes loose, cracking against your skull as it&apos;s dragged away by the torrent.*
What do you think you&apos;re up to? Hand that over, right now!
Brrr. Did anyone else feel that sudden chill? Well hello there. Care to trade?
Quick temper, eh? Well, let&apos;s get down to it!
You already know the answer to that.
*Wonder what drove him to betray his own order.*
I&apos;ll have you know that Lord Kemm himself buys from me.
The bowl is ready for the ritual. All it needs is fire...
The Advocate offered us the Source of a tormented soul in a distant dungeon. We refused.
*Say that you have some questions. If he answers them, he might yet live.*
Do not resist us.
Ah. There you are. Right on time.
Deiseis Riveil
A pity the Meistr&apos;s dead... But perhaps we can still find out more if we investigate her house.
*Ask the spirit what happened.*
...and stay with the Doctor forever.
I know... it&apos;s... great. Exciting. &lt;i&gt;Terrifying&lt;/i&gt;. A heady mixture of all three that makes my stomach feel like it&apos;s in a vice.
Brianna can take your report, &lt;i&gt;she&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; got the time. &lt;i&gt;Look&lt;/i&gt; at her lolling about! Why don&apos;t you just tell &lt;i&gt;her?&lt;/i&gt; JUST TELL HER!
[SOLDIER] *Say you&apos;ve heard of a dwarf called Beast before - among the rank and file, he&apos;s known as the Hawk of the High Seas.*
*He turns away from you and tucks his nose into his belly.*
