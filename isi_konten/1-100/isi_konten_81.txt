*You look up to the portrait. Its subject&apos;s face staring right back at you, one eyebrow raised as if lifted by a fishhook.*
Tenebrium Chest
Assortment of Books
Gods - I am so sorry. How could I have known...
Dwarf
Auto Detect
&apos;Looking around&apos;...? Unless you&apos;re in Magister cloth or lying dead in the dirt, you&apos;ve no business here.
Then I&apos;ll be quick: Queen Justinia&apos;s ordered some dwarf named Lohar to ambush a ship called the Peacemaker and take its cargo. Whatever&apos;s on it, she&apos;s using it against the rebels. She calls it &apos;Operation Downfall&apos;. Pretty ominous, eh?
*There are other realms. There is much to be gained from &lt;i&gt;nothingness.*&lt;/i&gt;
Now, get out of here, and try not to break anything on your way out, you filthy beast.
And here I was thinking you did it for the greater good...
None of you has the spirit of the One within. None of you prevails. Walk on in anonymity.
Disable this if you would rather not have screen shaking effects (e.g. when using certain skills).
Magister&apos;s Mantle
This floral-scented potion is commonly called &apos;King&apos;s Pal&apos;. It grants its drinker somewhat of a  resistance to poisoning.
While you walk this plane, there can be no rest. I would sooner rot in the grave than serve your savagery!
*You&apos;re ragged and dirty, twisted and bent - you move with a stooping, sideways gait. Thirsty, while a shopkeeper&apos;s back is turned, you approach a barrel of water and bend to drink.*
*With a grin, the skeleton throws his arms around you, squeezing you tight. He breaks off the embrace, grinning wildly.*
Well if Erma&apos;s still about I&apos;m hopin&apos; she&apos;ll give her mum a sign so I can get some shuteye! Don&apos;t get me wrong, I feel for the lass - she&apos;s no stranger.
Lord Reimond sent me to check out the place. I caught wind of the fire, and figured I should do somethin&apos; about it. Keep more ships from crashin&apos; on shore.
*Take your leave. *
*Avoid details. Tell him Mordus had made a mess of his operation.*
You are &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. But the gods are too busy fighting each other and tempting more interesting champions to notice you.
*You may be imagining it, but for a moment you think you can hear the God King laughing.*
Night
Here, take it. Just remember that I too covet the Swornbreaker as well... and you wouldn&apos;t deny me my deepests desires, would you?
After collecting the gauntlets of the Devourer, we experienced a strange longing for books and parchment, somewhere in the direction of Reaper&apos;s Eye. We should look for this place.
With Justinia dead, the dwarven Godwoken became the leader of dwarves. Dwarfdom became a centre of production, and dwarven technology became key in the battle against the God King - and the advancement of all the races.
Thorny Suncaller
*A glance at the dog&apos;s miserable face tells you it&apos;s sick alright.*
Here you stand.
Magister Bellworth
I promise, this story will warm you just as thoroughly!
We should bring both parts of the Swornbreaker to Almira.
They will be buried with you.
Maybe we can do something with this one.
*Turn away from her.*
*Your eyes flutter closed and you see what she sees - a reverie, an idyll: this corner of land as it was hundreds of years ago, when only seagulls dwelt upon these cliffs. Warm breezes touch your face, joy your heart.*
After a long and harrowing journey, Lovrik the waiter arrived in Cyseal, where he opened a tavern. The Meaty Stew became famed almost as much for its food as it was for its greasy, abusive owner.
We came to an unusual cave. Perhaps Anathema is inside.
Tomb of Vydia
*She smiles an enigmatic smile, full of darkness and more than a hint of malice.*
*Say you&apos;re with a group, but you can ditch them.*
Goblin Idle
*Ask her why, if that were the case, the Magisters had not done so already.*
&lt;b&gt;...no. NO!&lt;/b&gt;
It&apos;s good to have a trade. At least for me. The Lone Wolves gave me purpose when I needed just that.
Blessings on yeh, then, and yer cold hands. Stay safe out there.
&lt;i&gt;Perfect&lt;/i&gt;.
Another one of my Magisters has been taken. Let the tinkerer run; there&apos;s no way he could have been behind this... the real culprit&apos;s still out there...
White Magister Meeting Notes

Hard a-port! Can&apos;t ye hear the bell&apos;s a-ringing?! Hahahahaha!
Dungeon - Entrance Hall B
As for you: there&apos;s a little reward in order I think. There&apos;s a chest in the barracks, full of confiscated goods. If you see anything you like, it&apos;s yours to keep. You may have to pry it open though. I seem to have misplaced my key.
Aye. A captain ain&apos;t nothin&apos; without a crew.
*Inscrutable as ever, the Red Prince meets your gaze, then waves you away.*
*His mind closes to you as it closes to itself.*
My chosen! Come... come closer... so that you may see me... as I truly am...
Restore power to the barriers.
*...raises her hand from your cheek...*
Good stuff, huh?
But alas, it was not to last.
*Ifan&apos;s face turns sour as he mutters something under his breath that only the Paladin can hear. Hardwin loses all camaraderie and blanches, stepping backwards. He puts one hand on his weapon.*
It&apos;s for their own good. It&apos;s for the good of us all! If you can&apos;t understand that -
Are you ready to awaken?
Smoke and screams. Echoes of death...
*Hesitate and say nothing. You know for a fact this thing can&apos;t be trusted.*
Hel&apos;? Hel&apos;? Just DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST! That&apos;ll hel&apos;. Also...
*Tell him not to worry, you&apos;ve a special amulet that protects you from Voidwoken.*
*Reach out to stem the flow of oil.*
*Panicked shouts ring through the air, but you must not allow yourself to be distracted. Your eyes remain on your quarry: a female lizard, scales burning red, clad in opulent garb.*
Go on, kid. Climb up there and jigger the rope.
Double-crossed. Only one reason for that, I reckon: someone wants my head...
*Draw your weapon. You&apos;re here for revenge.*
Those... those atrocities don&apos;t act on their own. You know this as well as anyone.
Stand Your Ground
By Duna&apos;s dagger, crimson dragon! You here to free us, or kill us?
What?
|DESC|
Well. If Kemm sent you, then I trust your judgement. Paladins - come. Give this woman space.
Set [1].[2][3]
Co-co-COOLED your head, did you? Now wh-wh-WHERE were we?
The Doctor is a scourge to all of Rivellon. Put a stop to him, please.
*You see the outline of a skull - perhaps once an elf, though the flesh has all but rotted from his bones. What remains is the flat, dull colour of sick. He looks... familiar, somehow, but you can&apos;t quite place why. Behind him march ornately-clad Black Ring.*
Snakebite
*Say you don&apos;t want to make any alliances.*
Something on your mind, darling?
*Walk away from the altar.*
Very well. Moving on.
*The captain forces the parts of his face that can still move into a scowl.*
Truly...? Alright then...
*There must be something you can do. Ask if it will spare others if you sacrifice your Source to it.*
*Gareth serves a new purpose now. Consume his Source.*
Haste Skillbook
Really? Even the part where you... my goodness...
Find a way past the dwarf in the not-so-abandoned house.
*He staggers back, holding his nose. The wound on your neck quickly knits together.*
&lt;b&gt;She is ours. You will not speak to her. You cannot help her.&lt;/b&gt;
Ain&apos;t you looking chuffed?! If forces beyond think t&apos;interfere, I&apos;m grateful their gift is to reward us rather than punish us.
The Magisters with the red cloaks chased her into the woods. Grbbt. They&apos;ll be sorry! Grbbt!
You&apos;re kidding, right? Are you ready to face justice?!
*Relent. Ask what she has in mind.*
*Gesture to your ear and shrug your shoulders, indicating you don&apos;t understand.*
Now, if you&apos;ll excuse us.
We told Lagan we&apos;d search for his missing ring.
Lord Arhu is dead.
Mona
*The warg lolls its tongue from the side of its considerably large mouth.*
|As a [1] you can learn and cast source skills.|
*Keep her on tenterhooks for a moment, then... relax. Shake your head and walk away.*
Battle Source Puppet
*Shrug and give up.*
*Grin wickedly and move a little closer. What if it &lt;i&gt;is?*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him that Alexandar is dead.*
No-one tells me there are so many &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt; in this Fort Joy. Magisters I handle, but small ones...
*Tell him he still hasn&apos;t explained what led to his expulsion from the Ancient Empire.*
*Back away.*
*The demon turns to Lohse. He smiles and reaches out to her. She is still where she stands, wide-eyed. This is him: the thing that&apos;s been inside her head all this time.*
Something went wrong on our end; please try again.
F23
*The dwarf takes a step back. His eyes fall on your huge fists, opening and closing as you grind your teeth.*
|Reaper&apos;s Fingers Coast|
[SCHOLAR] *Nod your head, and tell her the captive is neither witch nor demon, but something much... darker. They need your expertise.*
Only Sebille could bring the elves together once more.
Why Arhu - I didn&apos;t know you had so many admirers! Come in, come in.
Marvellous, my friend - marvellous! You&apos;ll first have to get inside the fort itself. There&apos;s a secret switch on a statue of the Seven in the courtyard. Surely you know it?
Imagine I told Lohar about your little joke? Think he&apos;d be happy? Don&apos;t answer that - Lohar&apos;s rarely happy. Want to know what&apos;ll make Lohar happy?
*HNN!*
Find out how to defeat the Shriekers.
Embark on a new journey!

The time for gratitude is gone; the fight to survive is the only remaining battle.
Tell the druid what the Ancestor Tree told you.
Look! Slane promised his aid, and he is true to his word!
[JESTER] *Ask him if he knows the one about the waiter and the horse.*
Goodbye, then, mister. I hope I didn&apos;t say anything wrong.

After the first fresh shoots broke the earth, Ifan returned to the war,
Foreword&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tome takes the reader through later years of the life of Ch. Y. Meera, from the time she introduced her second successful thesis to the moment of her premature death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final years&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meera continued to deepen her knowledge on elemental infusions, adding a layer of factors to the equation. Dedicating every moment of her life to science, she established a method to infuse cursed and blessed elements. In contrary to popular opinion, it was not the increasing danger of her field of work that brought the doom upon her. Meera slipped on an oily trail left by one of the summons and fell down the well in her own yard.

*Insist that speed is key. If the Seekers stay mobile, they can avoid the Shriekers&apos; watchful eyes.*
Listen to your god.
Go below, see for yourself! She is a kind and wise mistress, but she needs &lt;i&gt;help!&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;A chicken is not the answer. Answer search continues...&apos;
Leya! No, not like this...!
What a grave mistake, my friend. What a very grave mistake...
