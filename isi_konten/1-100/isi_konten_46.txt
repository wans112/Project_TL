*The smell of burning rock and sulphur fades and you are standing before Zorl-Stissa once more.*
*Touching the hand of your companion, Source sparks between you. The magic of this place sings and arcane flesh wraps your bones. All of a sudden, you appear living. You &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; things. For the first time in a long, long time, you &lt;i&gt;sense&lt;/i&gt;, with all five senses.*
Then you&apos;re more the fool than I thought. Without aid, the Magisters&apos; Shriekers will tear them apart!
You doomed us, Fane! You doomed us all to this hell!
*The dusty jar remains untouched.*
Well, howdy there! Nice to see a fresh face among these dour saps.
Now I&apos;m the last one alive - the last engineer of the Cathedral and its secrets. I&apos;ve retired, and found a new calling - these wonderous darlings...
You&apos;ve got a point there.
I&apos;ve been trying to stop them for years. Now I&apos;m close to ending it all for good. I know it is much to ask of an elf, but will you help me?&lt;br&gt;
So how&apos;re you enjoying the Joy?
Something real, that I can see, hold in my hand! I can&apos;t just take the word of the likes of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
*A scrawny, unwell-looking bird sits despondently amongst some dead hens.*
[LOHSE] *Smile, and tell her you&apos;ve spent most of your life devoted to making melodies.*
But now...
Intriguing. How did Noxious Bulbs end up &lt;i&gt;here?&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her never mind - you don&apos;t remember anyone by that name.*
Pfft. Piss off, willya?
For a skull this small, it still oozes sadness. And magical potential.
You there! We&apos;re looking into the disappearance of Lord Arhu - if you learn &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;that might uncover his whereabouts, let us know at once!
Paused
*Bid her do as she pleases.*
[BEAST] *Tell him he&apos;ll find out when they write your name in the history books. Nod goodbye and walk away.*
Don&apos;t try telling me you just wandered in here by mistake.
Show World Tooltips
Sanders told us how to pass the Path of Blood.
Another crawling rat, tracking your stinking paws beneath my nose. Vermin are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; tolerated in my house. BEGONE!
*Shrugs* A trick of the light perhaps, and it wasn&apos;t the time to linger for another look.
Leatherhead
[JESTER] *Tweak his nose. Everyone loves you! Nobody doesn&apos;t not not &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; love some comic relief!*
The ravaged among the ruins. That is all we are in Fort Joy.
I...
*Zorl-Stissa smiles and you notice for the first time two vampire-like fangs glistening beneath her upper lip. A gulf of magic envelops you, and you feel a sudden insatiable hunger for Source.*
Black Ring Instructions
This is more like it! This room has standards.
[ELF] *Say you&apos;d prefer to consume &lt;i&gt;moss &lt;/i&gt;than his flesh. All you&apos;d see consuming him would be memories of bullies and impotence...*
*Demand to know who those memories belonged to.*
Too late for that. Cap&apos;s gonna play your spine like a piano. Or slave ya up.
What is this? I do not understand... My love was here... My love has gone... What am I?
No, I&apos;m sure it was not an easy decision.
Say it again. What you said about my wife. Go on.
Time to die!
Even now you see visions repellent to you. You see me as a mess of meat beset by maggots, your fingers sinking slowly into the slush that were my eyes, licking your thumbs.
Doctor&apos;s House Key
an ally
*Look through his supplies.*
&lt;i&gt;What?!&lt;/i&gt;
*Peer at her fate line. Widen your eyes and say you&apos;ve changed your mind.*
*Tell him to be reasonable - you&apos;re just trying to help.*
*Demand that she hand over the invitation, or you&apos;ll see that she winds up in a cell for public drunkeness.*
*Tears stream down her ruddy face, and she looks at you accusingly.*
Illusory Ornate Chest
Backstab
*Inform Jahan that Malady didn&apos;t survive the crash.*
*Suddenly, a whorl of energy enters you. You feel it uncoil in great bands, expanding outward from your belly to the top of your head and tips of your toes. You feel... perfected.*
Magical Large Hammer
*Say you&apos;ll be taking your leave.*
*Dollface? You&apos;ll decapitate this bastard here and now!*
Create a copy of this campaign?
*Tell her she&apos;ll find out soon enough - you&apos;ll get that demon out of her, one way or another.*
*Surprise me.*
Those Paladins will ruin Arx, mark my words. Nothin&apos; but a bunch of damn nobles playing soldier...
*Grab whatever is close at hand and move to attack the undead monster.*
G-g-g-g-greetings! Haveyoucomeformiracle? Doyouneedfixing from theDoctorman?
*He points at the Lone Wolf sharpshooter.*
*Order him to stop. Immediately.*
*The man doesn&apos;t respond - he&apos;s out cold.*
Seeker spirits told us that Karon is the Mistake, the Godwoken who disgraced them. He must not be released.
*But somewhere in the hum of voices, one cuts through the rest. &apos;Stop&apos; it hisses. &apos;Do your duty...&apos;*
We succeeded where the Magisters failed and found Meistr Siva&apos;s secret vault. There we should learn what it takes to become Divine.
The elf has done nothing wrong. I won&apos;t watch her be murdered.
*You preached the Devourer&apos;s blessings. He would bring them to greatness!*
But you tried to save the elves?
I come for prayer and penitence. Instead, I find... &lt;i&gt;waste.&lt;/i&gt;
Hail Strike
Bishop Alexandar and the others might still be out there - I need to find them. Let me stay by your side for now, you can count on my bow in any fights to come.
Alright, lemme have a look-see here.
Aaaargggh… Lucian’s balls, that bastard is going to ruin everything....
Fog-Swollen Crawler
&lt;i&gt;*ROAR!*&lt;/i&gt;
Only the Red Prince knows the truth.
Mmmmmm.
It&apos;s like staring death in the eye.
Are you sure you want to leave the Tutorial Deck?
*Scoff and say you&apos;re not going to do that.*
The King will be overcome and you will ascend. You &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;have your birthright.
My Queen: the elven specimen before you is a Godwoken - a claimant to the divine throne.
Teleport
Giant Drillworm
- she is my daughter. Her name is Saheila. And she is taken from us. That is why we come here. That is why we lose Sarias. To find her. If she is lost, if our Scion is lost, all our people are lost. She is &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell him he&apos;s wrong.*
*You frown with surprise. Alexandar vanished along with all the others when the Lady Vengeance breached the Hall of Echoes - you assumed he was dead.*
*She pauses, then nods her thanks to you before turning and following a path into the unknown.*
Hsst! &lt;i&gt;Fyr-a las!&lt;/i&gt; I am sorry, but you must &lt;i&gt;go!&lt;/i&gt;
*The Paladin spirit&apos;s last hours flash before your eyes.*
There&apos;s been a murder recently. You happen to know anything about it?
*Aggressive squeak.*
Unknown player
The fate of all humanity hangs in the balance. You would turn away from them?
*Ask if you can enter.*
*Make a half-hearted bow, muscle memory from your crusader days.*
W-what&apos;s... what&apos;s wrong with Mummy?
*Wonder what he might do next.*
Gareth failed to reach the armoury in time, but there is another vault - hidden beyond the Magister&apos;s guile.
Hannag
Valve
I will not.
Hostiles. Present. Express. Innocence.
*Say it was easy enough this time around. And now you&apos;d like to know what happened. Why is he here?*
[MYSTIC] *You&apos;re overcome with the urge to rub this lamp. Give in and wipe it clean.*
&lt;br&gt;T H E&lt;br&gt;K E Y&lt;br&gt;T O&lt;br&gt;T H E&lt;br&gt;M O U N T A I N .
*Tell him you don&apos;t believe in abandoning the defenceless.*
If we don&apos;t make it, I&apos;m glad we got this far. Together.
*Your God emerges as a snake, slithering along the ground towards the fawn, where it coils around its neck.*
*Demand an explanation. What does it mean, the red of old?*
*A raging torrent of memories washes through you - so fast you can barely see an image before it&apos;s gone... an elven child, the moon, the sun, the Void, the dirt, the death in the fog amongst the trees...*
I&apos;m a rat, I don&apos;t have anything to give you. Don&apos;t know anything useful. Um... despite your many manifest flaws, you get to feel good about yourself?
The Mother Tree
*Order the facts: They invited a deadly Sourcerer here, who summoned Voidwoken upon the entire village?*
She was my friend. Or so I thought.
*Then, just as sensuous, his hands are like the vines he spoke of as they meander all over your body.*
You&apos;d believe that?! Argh - you&apos;re of no use. No use! She&apos;s got him as her thrall, as her puppet!
Add-on was succesfully installed.
Enter the shop at your leisure. Sir.
Ancient Lamp
Isbeil&apos;s Notes
The Lone Wolf Roost Anlon sold Sebille to her master. To find the master, Sebille must go to Reaper&apos;s Coast and track Roost down.
Voluble Mage
*Ask with whom you have the honour.*
*Admire the sheen of her feathers.*
You did your duty well, Seaman. Be proud. You are dismissed.
I won&apos;t forget you either, Beast. Good bye.
Dungeon - Empty Room (Right Angle)
*Tell Lucian you shouldn&apos;t have believed his lies before - and you don&apos;t believe them now.*
Hair Colour
*Show this hunk of junk who&apos;s boss.*
*With a smile, he propels you towards the bed. You fall backwards onto the soft mattress. He jumps on you. Kisses you.*
*Wonder, as the spirit, which of these things are true - is she a killer or a thief?*
You don&apos;t know how to answer me, do you?
And hurry. He&apos;s due to sail any minute.
*Don&apos;t do it.*
Choose teleport destination.
That&apos;s the original stake, plus one half, repaid on demand, or you die. And know this - no-one owes me money for long. That is... no-one &lt;i&gt;alive.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask where to find Lohar.*
Of silver, gold, and diamonds, now dispose...
I&apos;ll be sure to ask Sister Avenny to confirm your story, at some point in the very near future.
Don&apos;t fret, m&apos;lady, and don&apos;t falter. You needn&apos;t call to Lucian for succour, for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am here to answer your purchasing prayers on this day of celebration!
[1] turned into dust.
Plains - High Road
Incinerator
*You&apos;re going to help. There are probably a lot of confused Sourcerers out there.*
They gave you your broad shoulders, your stout firmament.
Not fun. Loud! Fire and steel! Crash bash boom splat! It was warm, then it was cold. No-one left. Just salamanders. They like the meat.
Mouth off about Sourcerers again and I&apos;ll have your tongue out, you hear? Good Magisters are &lt;i&gt;dying &lt;/i&gt;thanks to them and their foul magic!
*The girl turns to you in a panic.*
No no, not the pain. Not the suffering.
You now have a storage chest on the Lady Vengeance. Use the action menu to send items there for safe-keeping.
My brothers were confident they could help her as well, but they still had to lock her up here in the end.
Not sure why you&apos;re still hanging around here. You know what you need to do.
But... they&apos;ll... kill you on sight if you don&apos;t know the proper password. Heal me... and I&apos;ll gladly tell you.
You! Hold there!
New information was added to your journal! Press [IE_ToggleJournal] to access it. Note that quests given explicitly to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;one party member&lt;/font&gt; will only show in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; character&apos;s log.
It won&apos;t budge! This monster, it...
*The hooded man exudes a restrained menace that near matches your own. As he raises his head, the hood falls back, revealing the gleaming bone visage of an undead.*
For show...? Of course I&apos;ve read all of them! What do you take me for?! I&apos;ll wager you don&apos;t know a fraction of what I&apos;ve gleaned from a lifetime of reading...
That &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the question, isn&apos;t it? How does one top the greatest feat of necromancy ever conceived? I might have the answer to that... tell me, have you ever heard of Gustavchen&lt;i&gt;...?&lt;/i&gt;
