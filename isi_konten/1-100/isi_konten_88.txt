*Lord Kemm turns his back to you. The matter is closed.*
Large Water Resistance Potion
*The Red Prince sighs as he looks at you with a certain sadness.*
*Stand before him in shock. Mutter that he just killed a kin in cold blood.*
*An elf sits tucked away in a dark spot, lazily rolling dice onto the surface of a barrel. They sound like the dry cackling of an old witch.*
When it is time for you to leave, Mistress, I will be ready. I serve no-one but you.
*Inform him that &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian &lt;/i&gt;has gone missing.*
*Ask what she makes of the gods, the tree, and... everything.*
Speaking in Forked Tongues
Elven Crossbow
Dwarven Hand Axe
You are not on our books, but the Doctor may still make time for you... if he declines, perhaps&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;can make time for you...
*His head wrenches violently towards you. A moan escapes the helmet, followed by a trickle of bright blood. Beneath the helm, fever-bright eyes snap to meet yours.*
*Decline. You&apos;re not sure that would be wise...*
*Try to peer beyond the blackness of the girl&apos;s eyes, and say you want to ask her some questions in order to help her.*
Well, now. It seems you know the exact price for my silence! Let&apos;s just go about our business then, shall we?
Appearance
Hah. Yeah. Probably not. But we won&apos;t go down without a fight!
*You&apos;re the Black Widowmaker, deep down in black shadows, setting your latest creation to paper. A deadly brew that looks and tastes like an elixir, it&apos;s your best work yet. You sip a celebratory tonic...*
Go in Amadia&apos;s grace, child.
*She turns towards you. When she opens her eyes she&apos;s looking right at you.*
Magical Recurve Crossbow
Searching...
Vigour
Like Saheila, I too am an elven Scion. She implored me to go to the Nameless Isle and talk to the Mother Tree.
Duna be damned, but these torches won&apos;t stay lit!
Find Gwydian Rince.
Walk away then. I&apos;d expect nothing less from someone as scaly and weird as you are.
I don&apos;t know this goddess, but I can imagine the tall tales told of her.
What I have seen is a cautionary tale.
Oh of course there are! How many hundreds of thousands of mortals have died over the years?
Someone stirs below decks, I can feel them.
*Remind her that she&apos;s stuck on an island.*
All those souls lost, and there&apos;s still no guarantee we&apos;ll destroy the demon. What a waste.
Linder Kemm&apos;s Journal
Remove
*Take your leave.*
The Order must persist. The Order must endure. The Magisters can no longer have power.
Sadha is dead. The Red Princess is no more.
It was me following orders that led to this. And, looking back on our time together, I see no reason to follow &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; orders.
Rusty Hammer
*A whisper and a moan.*
My beard&apos;s all a-prickle. That doesn&apos;t bode well.
Perhaps I am already mad. But I swear I hear the bells - please, make it stop.
*Pocket the stone and ask if there&apos;s anything you can do to help.*
We shouldn&apos;t take the risk. We can be happy elsewhere.
*Ask where she needs to go.*
*A toy-maker? Ask why a toy-maker would be of interest to you.*
*You&apos;re low on patience. Attack your accuser.*
Spirit of a Black Ring Witch
*Say it&apos;s about earlier. The night of nights so to speak.*
The Mother asks you to help her. A lizard assassin stands near. A prince of shadows, come to strike at the heart of the elves. He must die, this lizardous doombringer. And you must bring me his heart.
*Ask her where she learned her manners.*
*The cat sighs melodramatically, and looks away.*
Sadha
Please... &lt;i&gt;BACAW...! &lt;/i&gt;please leave me be...
Do not disappear like that as I speak to you - so impolite!
Now, you have all the power you need. You were a wonderful Shield as we fled, but we are not running any more. Now you must become the Axe.
But you must.
Vigilance
Y-you can never understand. How were we to know? How are we... how are we ever to know?
This was briefer, I remember the conception of my little girl took almost a day. But for all its brevity, this was...
*Grin - indeed, training under a dark Sourcerer sounds like fun!*
He spent a lot of time in my home. I invited him over to discuss the matters of the city, but he never arrived.
*Tell the creature you will use its power to become Divine.*
[JESTER] *Ask him how he&apos;ll know if you&apos;re being smart.*
The Butler
*Nod and explain that the dwarf is dead. Now you&apos;d like some gold so you can be on your way.*
*Express your confusion about the Endless Prayer - does it really never end?*
Cat Pillow
A pressure plate? The right amount of weight should have an effect, then.
Ingenious
White Magister
Looking for games...
Cat Scared
*Slowly the heat abates as she releases you with a kiss. Your vision swims back into view: Almira observing you with a knowing smile.*
Arx remained the centre of power as the races united behind the Divine.
I just wanted to distract you while I nipped a little gold out your pocket. Needed a fix. Sorry.
*She stands silent, stock still.*
*Admit that you have nothing to report right now.*
If there&apos;s something you want to find out from him... you might want to ask &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;I have my word with him.
Two-Handed Splitting Axe
*...in bliss.*
Decaying Body Part
*Excuse yourself. You have no time for melodramatic evolutionary throwbacks.*
[MYSTIC] *Hold your hand to her head. Ease her worry; show her peace. She can trust you with this prisoner.*
[SCHOLAR] *Recall a common greeting from a generation ago and respond in kind: &apos;...and his seven blessings upon us undeserving.&apos;*
Tenacious little fellows, aren&apos;t they?
*Say that this is of little concern to you - you&apos;re set on escaping this place.*
*As you breathe in rhythmic synchronisation, he begins to hum a low, rumbling note.*
Precious Key
Hard to say if any of the others made it to shore...
Tagged VILLAIN
*She nods.*
Exploration Theme 04 Bansuri
Mm? Hmm-mm... pow!
This might have once been their world, but that doesn&apos;t give them the right to destroy it.
*You feel... bare. You reach up to feel your mask. It is still there - but somehow, you understand that he will see the real you...*
*A purple-faced Magister claws at an organic breastplate. His comrade tries desperately to open it, but to no avail - it&apos;s bound by thin vines, burrowing into flesh.*
Ripped-Off Dwarven Face
*Remark that you think they should stay.*
...friends of the Ring are destroyed...
*Ask the child who he&apos;s so frightened of.*
[HERO] *Assure her that this is real, but the danger&apos;s passed. She&apos;s safe now.*
Draught of Wits
The door is blocked... I can&apos;t get through.
Nothing here. But how about in the future, you don&apos;t go sticking your hands in other people&apos;s pockets?
Sets the Shocked status on a target within arm&apos;s length and deals [2].
A wicked king, it was. Braccus Rex by name. The Order of the Source Hunters discovered a great horror upon this prison isle, and I was sent to stop it.
Why do you choose this path? It corrupts the dream, and corrupts your soul.
Birds Desert 02
*It looked like the squirrel was trying to say something earlier on the boat. Ask what he has for you.*
Ready, chief?
*&apos;...nothing burns in rainfall, and smoke gets in your hair.&apos;*
*Say you&apos;ll have a pint of the ale, then.*
Cursed... daughter. Lost... lost...
*You pick up its gift - a round, white stone - and are getting ready to leave when  you feel a cold, heavy thump on your shoulder. You look up into the fierce red eyes of the raven.*
Sun-baked
Chuff to you, chief! Here are your cards. You&apos;re up first.
For the realm. For your loved ones. For the children you&apos;ll never have...
That&apos;s not nice. That&apos;s not nice AT ALL.
*Leave the jar alone.*
Then my last oasis is no longer, and I make my final stand.
Myrvl the Accursed
At last I see clearly. I know what must be done.
*Nod and move to cross the bridge past him.*
*He looks through your eyes with seeming disinterest as the life ebbs from his body, drop by drop, until he is gone and the flesh that housed him slumps to the ground.*
My purpose became yours. You fulfilled it well.
What&apos;s happening to these turtles? They&apos;re... they&apos;re transforming!
Door Open
Almost to the top deck. If this ship&apos;s going down, I&apos;m sure as hell not going down with it!
A new world is upon us. And it, too, will need defending.
*Relieved, she kisses your lips. Then your forehead. Then each cheek. Your chin. Your neck. The crown of your head.*
What a dutiful detective you have turned out to be! I&apos;d hire you on, but I do my best work alone.
The site&apos;s close. It has to be. There&apos;s more stones to break, more earth to turn! We need t&apos; get there!
*Stay put. After all, she has a flair for drama.*
Trader Haran
*Several bystanders begin to chatter and giggle maniacally, while tearing off their clothes... and &lt;i&gt;clawing off their skin.&lt;/i&gt; Profane monsters emerge from the bloody husks of people.*
It will be buried with you.
Allow Clicking Through Log Window
It&apos;s fine. Just a scrape. Others have it worse.
*Inform them that Mordus is dead.*
*...as he finds the rhythm of the song that only he can hear... he sways and moves, silky with power and poise, at once beguiling and raw with pure emotion...*
[HUMAN] *Sing a song of humanity&apos;s triumphs. Perhaps the statue will acknowledge you.*
*The spirit of a dwarf frowns at you, suspicion drawing the lines of his face deep.*
Wine Barrel
*Growl...* Don&apos;t touch t&apos;honey. &apos;s ours. &lt;i&gt;Bog off.&lt;/i&gt;
Well, hello there! Fine day for a walkabout, don&apos;t you think?
Please do!
Best get back on that, eh? Or they&apos;ll be calling you the Silver Flaw, hahaha!
An ancestor tree stands here! I can feel its power...
*Their commander is a vile-looking lizard, his face the very definition of mischief. Chuckling, he addresses the couple.*
Dead Black Ring Fearmaiden
*Let the Doctor look after you. Let go.*
*The God steps forward, grabbing you by the chin, and twisting your face towards the sky. The clouds clear and the sun emerges, bright in the sky.*
*Alone and shaded by forest canopy, your steps silenced by soft brush underfoot.*
I... know... it&apos;s... doomed. Mmmmm? All... will... die... and... all... will... fall... to... ruin. Mmmmm. You... bring... chaos... here. You... bring... death. Mmmmm? Leave... me... out... of... it. Leave... me... be.
The Gods have poor choice in Godwoken, if you ask me.
A yarrow flower calmed the gheist.
This isn&apos;t the place to be waving your weapons around like that.
Natalie&apos;s Anguish
For more information on the black market in Arx, the merchant Victor Voss sent us to the cheese vendor.
Margey Marge is SLEEPING!
Hahahaha you found me! Ok wait, wait, wait, let me hide again. Ready...
So close. Yet so far away...
*Reply that it is indeed a damn shame!*
*Tell him this is it. He&apos;s either with you or against you.*
So ya figured me out, did ya? Was so proud of it, too. Even had the next heist lined up. Looks like my thievin&apos; days are done, dammit.
We did it!
Which god hears his pleas... and what comfort could the dead find in his words?
Well, hopefully that&apos;s one less Godwoken for you to worry about when the time comes. &lt;i&gt;Do &lt;/i&gt;tell me the time is on its way. I&apos;ll kill you and then myself if I find out I brought you all the way here for nothing.
