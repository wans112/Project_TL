*Say you&apos;re not interested in what anyone else thinks of you.*
I never liked you anyway, Mudbarrow. You or your shite sense of humour. Don&apos;t think you haunt me, dead man. You or the Godwoken that we killed.
*Tell him he should go home. Away from this place. This craziness.*
In this primitive state, the ore is little more than dead weight. But when wedded with a white-hot furnace...
Dear child, you sacrifice too much. You need peace, rest... come here, and stay with me a while.
Open it at once! This could be valuable.
Ah hello. I am very sorry to see the... &lt;i&gt;thing &lt;/i&gt;inside. Is it becoming... stronger?
*The Doctor turns to you after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact you made.*
*You seem to have made him a tad nervous. Excellent.*
I am Meistr Siva, head- well, &lt;i&gt;ex&lt;/i&gt;-head of the Seekers. I was hoping to guide you on your way to Divinity, but apparently you don&apos;t need any help.
*The creature continues blubbering incoherently.*
*The soul jar pulses with trapped lifeforce.*
The Black Ring are your enemy, Godwoken - why do you aid them?
A letter penned in dark ink.
Empty bluster, serpent! Now leave me be - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
*Tell her you&apos;re back, and you&apos;re looking for work.*
I suppose that&apos;s correct. Though I&apos;ve yet to find any Sourcerers who were inclined to wander away after being totally cured.
*Each breath makes you stronger. The voices fortify you, quicken your pulse, make a space in your heart where - yes - a great power can inhabit you.*
[JESTER] *You&apos;re overjoyed! Finally, someone with the sense to  speak gibberish.*
[ELF] The world is far beyond absolution and redemption now. This world is only about survival. And there are choices to be made.

Now - there&apos;s little time to spare. We need to get you to Arx. Find Dallis. Take back what she stole.
*Tell her to hold fire - you&apos;re on her side. You&apos;re here to help!*
Vacuum Touch
Papa?
We defeated Alexandar. We can now board the Magister flagship anchored offshore and escape the island.
I bid you farewell.
Spirit of a Commoner
The horrors of this world aren&apos;t confined to Fort Joy. The worst is still to come.
Hunting him is proving to be like... looking with a needle through a haystack.
*Tell him to wait here. It&apos;ll soon be safe to put out the fire and save what he can.*
&apos;course. You&apos;ve been busy &apos;round here, haven&apos;t you. Did you think the Lone Wolves wouldn&apos;t find out there was a Godwoken in our neighbourhood?
[An instruction manual, written by a lumberjack mage, daughter of a lumberjack mage, on how to make the best parchment. If you skip to the end you will find that the secret is this:&lt;br&gt;- Wood chips (whether found as they are, or cut with an axe).&lt;br&gt;- Water (in a container, of course).&lt;br&gt;- A fire for drying.]
There was a small... incident, which prompted my many rivals to move against me. Technically, they had the letter of the law on their side.
You shouldn&apos;t spend so much time inside that noggin of yours, my girl! Does you no good.
*Stand aside. They&apos;re free to go.*
I want to know more! More! Return to me when you have a chance, and share your adventures. I want to hear about every spell cast and cliffside scaled! Every chest pillaged, and every sword swung!
*As a lover, say. You mean that quite earnestly.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
OK
*He sees your backward movement and stands still, raising his hands in a conciliatory gesture.*
*Tell him you saved Arx from the Black Ring by destroying their Deathfog device.*
*...reflected in a button on his shirt, you see gold. You have a one in three chance of guessing the correct card. Take it.*
*As your song unfolds she moves less and less. A worried look appears in her eyes.*
[On this tattered paper, you find your own warning given so long ago to the Paladins concerning the Black Ring working with the Magisters.]
*As you exit the wagon you&apos;re awaited by a vile-looking lizard, his face the very definition of mischief.*
Difficulty
*Use the yellow lever.*
*Remain silent.*
Steam Lance Skillbook
A dark force erupted from within an innocent, whom we had tried to help. It made this island its own, and killed all that it found.
Quercusâ€¦ where are we?
We overcame the temple&apos;s defences.
Responsibility
*Smiles.* Who needs thralls, when I have selfless acquaintances such as yourself? I&apos;ll await you here.
*Ask her what you should expect on the island.*
[NOBLE] *Stay graciously still. He must be preparing to bow; how nice that some people remember their manners even in these trying circumstances.*
You are the Beast of the Sea, the Godwoken, the Divine in waiting. You will do your people proud.
Medium Invisibility Potion
I serve my lord in all things. He demanded that I secure the barrels, and now he demands your death.
*A cracked laugh escapes from her throat, although her face and eyes remain placid and unseeing as ever.*
You didn&apos;t...
[SOLDIER] *There&apos;s no mistaking that shade of red... ask him where he got the blood for the painting.*
*Gareth is a tempest. He yanks open dresser drawers, then slams them shut. He opens books, then violently tosses them to the floor.*
She&apos;s in there now, looking for this... this &lt;i&gt;thing. &lt;/i&gt;I don&apos;t know what it is. But Cat promises our lives are about to change for the better.
Foggy Warm
I questioned Siva&apos;s trust in her, but Malady&apos;s usefulness is... self-evident. As Lucian said, &apos;You will be eternally gifted when you act in my name&apos;.
*Say that it might not be too late. Perhaps there is a way to bring everyone back?*
Pain is not a limited resource, Han. There&apos;s plenty to go round here.
The wheels are already in motion, Godwoken. My death changes nothing - Dallis will prevail.
*Wink and say that he should trust his pet.*
No. No, it&apos;s fine. I... I don&apos;t know why I did that. I suppose I&apos;m a bit skittish from time to time. Skittish, like a cat that&apos;s seen too much unkindness.
*Groan and say that you feel like your stomach is on fire...*
Rather, we must find a way to live together in peace, giant and squirrel.
*Tell him a few pebbles won&apos;t be enough to stop Voidwoken.*
Rate your experience
*This journal was apparently used for tracking the patrol routes of Arx Paladins. Each target is described in detail, from the gender and hair color of each Paladin to the fit and condition of their uniforms.*
Time to fix what&apos;s broken...
*Ask her what she thinks you should do now.*
[NOBLE] *You&apos;ve never felt so... elevated. Say the world is an oyster, and you its pearl.*
There you are.
Quest Markers
...call me Tarquin, and consider me at your service.
Suffice it to say there were... obstacles. The House of Shadows, agents of the God King, and other trifles quite beneath your royal ears to suffer.
Lohar&apos;s associates intercepted some Magister cargo.
And so I must trust it to be done, then. &lt;i&gt;My prince.&lt;/i&gt;
Just one question left. The one question as yet unanswered in your flesh.
Magister Reimond
*The old man smiles, his lips shaking, tears glittering in the corners of his eyes.*
Malady was trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal to which she was bound.
M&apos;lord Ros,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pack what you can and leave Arx on the next coach. Her Majesty retrieved the Deathfog. You &apos;n I both know where she&apos;ll use it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck, and my congratulations to yer lass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Lohar
You are... IRRESISTIBLE! I &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;you, Sourcerers. I NEED you!
Desertions...? What do you know about &lt;i&gt;desertions?&lt;/i&gt;
*Fish the egg from your pack and show it to her.*
*Say no-one will aid you. You wish to fight alone.*
*Shelter? Does he mean the Sanctuary of Amadia? You already know the place.*
Deathfog... all gone, all gone, all gone. My Mindula, no more. No more my Samil, my Valeria...
Grenade Love
Quiet! A Paladin&apos;s life is on the line.
We saved some Black Ring prisoners from execution.
*Tell him he is a true warrior, and you are in need of a bodyguard.*
*Alright, you say, you know this scam. They can take what they came for and leave.*
Air
Next in the long line of clues is a Lone Wolf. And boy, how you&apos;ll make him howl.
As such, I am here to cut short a very ancient evil indeed, and would welcome the aid of one as formidable as your divine self.
All. Godwoken. Must. Complete. Their. Studies.
Hmmm, if I understand this correctly, it reads: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Walk safely in Vrogir&apos;s path.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit either can&apos;t speak, or won&apos;t. Its scorn, however, remains obvious.*
There is no other elf like me.
I suppose one should mind one&apos;s words in the company of an impressionable youth.
Void Salamander
No. It is a beautiful act. A holy act.
The Order... it&apos;s changed you...
*He looks surprised. Might be faking it. Might not.*
Grasp of the Starved Scroll
*Say combat has been pretty good.*
How crude. I have seen more intricate design in a butcher&apos;s slab.
As you can see, I&apos;m a little busy. Give me a hand with these cretins, will you?
*The turtle gurgles happily.*
Stand back, lads! The merc here&apos;s going to show us how it&apos;s done! She&apos;s going to bring the Sourcerer out unarmed. Because between you and me, if he comes out here armed, we&apos;ll kill him on the spot.
Rubble
Thou art returned? Peace is too much for a soul to hope for, it seems.
Ball?
May I interest you in some articles of particular value?
It is time we talk about the prophecy, sire.
Civil Abilities
*Assure her that all is OK. It is safe to share her story with you.*
*Burnish the pearl; look closer.*
I gave you every chance to show me who you were. And then ya did.
I hope to hear her whole story some day. I&apos;m certain it&apos;ll be quite the tale.
How about you put away your weapon before we chat?
Hell&apos;s teeth, it feels good to breathe mortal air again! I can smell your putrid lives in every breath. How delicious...
Although only open water remained, ships would steer clear.
...
*Refuse. She is not really the one you love.*
*Just... wait. There is no use struggling; you can&apos;t move.*
More recently, he&apos;s taken the most honoured post as the Keeper of the Cathedral, where he oversees Lucian&apos;s final resting place.
He&apos;s not all there. We need to put him out of his misery and move on.
I&apos;ve been re-reading this book. Looking over your history once again. Poring over every detail with a new perspective, and do you know what?
Lowers the damage from piercing attacks
Lord Ruaney&apos;s Britches
Nice of you to come. Saved me the trouble of hunting you down.
*He reaches out one scarred hand to touch you, gentle as can be.*
*Remark that she&apos;s clearly no farmer - she must be trespassing too...*
Attack_Ranged_1
*Unsheathe your weapon. You&apos;re not going anywhere...*
It&apos;s been a pleasure.
He ruled this realm as a tyrant and beast. He stole its Source and left only death. On this island he built and tested his weapons.
Distressed Magister
*Take your leave.*
Groawr.
Just like mine.
I hope you&apos;ll wield your new powers with care... &lt;i&gt;both &lt;/i&gt;of you...
Please, help my wife!
They won&apos;t take &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; unawares! I&apos;m... I&apos;m ready for anything, see? I haven&apos;t slept in... in... well, I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;ready&lt;/i&gt;, that&apos;s what matters! Vigilance!
No matter how the Kingdom would fare -
[VILLAIN] *Compliment him on his fine form. He was dead before he hit the ground!*
