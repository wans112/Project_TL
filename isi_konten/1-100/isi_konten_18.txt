His voice no longer speaks to us, my dear. But I&apos;m afraid my recovery will take a touch of time. I am well past my prime, you know.

Gauntlets of Marvel
Level [1]: Summons start with [2]% more Vitality, Damage, Physical Armour and Magic Armour.
*Ahem*
The Magisters? They don&apos;t care whether we live or die. And Griff and his thugs would sooner cut out my tongue than hear a plea for help. No, no, they can&apos;t help me at all...
From Vitality ability: [1][2]%
*Take your leave.*
Glorious Seven... may a Godwoken survive this, so that they can go on to do the right thing - and may that Godwoken be &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;

Later!
*Tell her to get to the point. You don&apos;t have all day.*
*Say that you&apos;d like to talk a bit more about her scar.*
*Try another tactic.*
Source weapons? Here? No wonder the fish are rancid! By the Divine, someone will suffer for their treachery.
Well, I&apos;m a rat. And you&apos;re some kind of... hm... flick-tongued scale-slitherer. Never the twain shall mix, thus spaketh the reddish large-style flesh-beasts!
The Doctor... damn him...
*He begins to fade from view, but as he disintegrates, he traces an esoteric sigil in the air between you and pushes forceful energy into you, restoring you.*

No, PLEASE! I won&apos;t fail you again!
&lt;i&gt;you lie you serve yourself or alexandar or your own dead god who cares who you think you serve you will serve the king now yes you&apos;ll serve the king for you will die&lt;/i&gt;
*Return to other matters.*
As impeccably mundane as I have come to expect from this world.
*The dwarf slaps his knees and chest until a buoyant rhythm develops, and begins to - well, not sing, exactly, but &lt;i&gt;chant.*&lt;/i&gt;
*He leans into a deep bow.*
&lt;i&gt;Cowaaaaaaards! Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine! You who will not fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the rat it risks becoming a dead rat. Is that high on its list of dreams?*

Still, at least there&apos;s &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; less villain, thanks to Lord Kemm.
*She shudders and looks around her, then back to you, and begins to weep.*
Hers.
I&apos;d say this here&apos;s what you need, eh?

Next time, I&apos;ll pick a spot you won&apos;t soon forget.

You... you are not the witch. You are not Dallis.

You wouldn&apos;t kill &apos;erfectly innocent heads like us just to see what&apos;s inna chest, wouldja?! There&apos;s no honour no &apos;ore. None at all.
The dragon attacked me. I was forced to fight back.
Dallis&apos; pets. Such helpful tools they are, too. The abominations do the dirty work, and the Whites keep their robes clean. &lt;i&gt;Convenient.&lt;/i&gt;
Game Master is asking [1] to roll [2] [3]
I don&apos;t care! Keep on alert until this fiend&apos;s head is on spike - I don&apos;t want to end up like the others! Now, you...
Poor little Lohse. Who are you? What are you?
The Knights will never hurt us again, Quercus. I promise.
Esteemed fellows, my research has led me into some dark and delicious corners of late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iâ€™ve found a connection between poison and Sulfurium that could change the face of war. With one, damage can be done. But with both together? Sheer havoc can be wrought. Let me outline the science....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The tome continues with incomprehensible equations and scientific jargon]
But I can&apos;t sense it anymore? Where is it... oh, where could it be?

...but that was not a good joke. Guards - kill her!&lt;br&gt;
Quick Save
Junk? Why, I offer nothing less than the wisdom of the ancients, and...
After all that&apos;s happened, it does me good to see you here.
Oh, man, The tales I could tell.
*The dwarf appraises you for a moment, then sighs and jabs his knife at one of the dissected fish.*
*Sigh deeply. You stand quite perplexed. What a story that was!*
In all seriousness though, the prospect both tickles and terrifies me.
Spirit of Syrus Oates
*Shout for her to stop. Stay away from him!*
*Tell him the longer you wait, the more it will hurt.*
As you will it, Godwoken...
He&apos;s probably supposed to look wise and comforting. I&apos;m not convinced.
*The Quorum? What was that all about?*
Hear the good news, kin. The elves are free. The Mother is gone.
*Roll your eyes and walk away.*
Lady Neta
That&apos;s not necessarily suspicious - I&apos;m sure Lord Kemm can put your mind at ease, if you ask him.
*Bring up the scuffle in the garden. Did he know about the attack plants?*
Likewise, I am sure. But I am not here to bandy niceties. Our situation is somewhat less than ideal.
*Step aside and gesture for Lohse to take the lead.*
Well, there you have it.
*She tries to speak but can only gape as she clutches her neck, trying to stem the bleeding of a gushing wound.*

Oh. You &lt;i&gt;wound&lt;/i&gt; me, you do! My passions veritably scorch my soul. Now listen. You&apos;ll enjoy this story.
A bribe, eh? I&apos;m not so easily purchased, thief. You&apos;re under arrest.
*The mob drops to its knees as one. The shimmering lake, once placid, begins to boil and bubble, draining Source from every supplicant.*
Truly. You are so willing to walk away from your destiny. To turn your back on the world because you fear for &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;safety.
You must find the temple where the Devourer&apos;s loyal servant was abandoned. I will draw strength from there to speak again.
A fair price for my silence. Now you go your way, and I go mine.

Projectiles targeted at or near this character are sent back where they came from.
Bedlinen
*Kneel and mutter a prayer to Vrogir.*
*Jumpy, is she? Ask why she&apos;s so on edge.*
I&apos;ve heard they&apos;re not showing Hubert Oak&apos;s work.
Frozen
Oh! Nice job on Alexandar, by the way. &lt;i&gt;That&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; net you a pretty penny, I&apos;d wager.
Louie
*She draws closer to you; you feel the heat of her body next to yours.*
I&apos;m busy. Goodbye.
*Your eyes glance over to the place where she keeps her needle. No, say: you&apos;re not afraid.*
You&apos;re one of the only indisputably innocent people on the ship. Unless you can commit murder in your sleep, of course.
Mass Corpse Explosion
*The spirit shakes his head and rolls his eyes. He&apos;s got nothing left to say to you.*

Nothing. Dammit!
They left as Godwoken.
Bring me the will while I &apos;mourn&apos;, and you&apos;ll be well rewarded for three minutes&apos; work.
*As the soul spills from the broken jar, the arm in your bag revolts. It clambers out and falls to the floor.*
It is not wrong to walk in the camp. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; wrong to assault one walking. Even here.
*Ask what progress he&apos;s made with Anathema.*
I&apos;d better be on my way. Someone&apos;s waiting on pins and needles for this particular information. I do thank you for your help!
Come now. Even you have never shied from playing the villain when it&apos;s prudent. We&apos;re not nice. We&apos;re just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask how you may avoid his mistake.*
Roost&apos;s Hand
I am one of you, after all. Your collar is no tighter than my own.
How fierce! You would almost be an asset.
*The dwarf raps his fingers against the windowsill.*
*Express your condolences.*
*Sharply refuse to carry out the God King&apos;s command.*
Seems &lt;i&gt;peaceful&lt;/i&gt; here, doesn&apos;t it? A quiet day in a quiet town. One wouldn&apos;t think these drifting woods toss on dwarf-troubled waters.
Tragedy befell us at the consulate, but at least Lord Kemm offered us pleasantries and protection. He&apos;s one of the few truly honourable souls left in this city.

*Squeeze back. Consume Kinnet&apos;s Source.*
*Take your leave.*
Tell you what, though. Take this...
Alright, hold still now...
We&apos;ve got to keep moving!
Rustling leaves no longer remind me of autumn. A songbird&apos;s call no longer makes me whistle. Now, they might signal a Voidwoken&apos;s attack.
Forest Green
*You step up to the cell to look at the skeleton you know to be Windego. The barrier mutes her Source, but it isn&apos;t her Source you fear, but something... more. A shadow. She says nothing - but you still hear her words.*
*Tell him that Arhu is missing.*
It was I who pushed for secrecy, for as I held you both in my arms mere days after your birth, I knew the moment had come. As I knew the shadows would close in.
*The Voidwoken claims that the Eternals can return to this world. That Fane can be home again.*
[FANE] *Tell him that your name is in a language he has never heard and cannot pronounce, but he may call you Fane.*
*The pain has faded, and a strange sort of beauty remains. Your own name lies golden upon your skin: a blessing, and a promise of things to come.*
Stop it!
You deaf? I said: &lt;i&gt;sod off!&lt;/i&gt;
The Prime Scion, destined to be the mother of elves; all hope of elven survival could depend on Sebille.
Worms, darling, worms in my head... wriggly-writhing, crawling about. Heehee!
*Gareth stares intently - not so much &lt;i&gt;at &lt;/i&gt;you, as&lt;i&gt; through &lt;/i&gt;you.*
But - he&apos;s really nice - and tall! Kind of! Maybe he can even help you with that thing...
You&apos;ve got a deal. Now get out of here, before I change my mind.
With Lohar dead we can finally close the chapter on dwarven conspiracy in Driftwood. Hard to believe it was a dwarf that closed it! The Magisters are indebted to you. You have done us a great service indeed!
*Remove the lid from the jar and absorb the soul inside.*
H-help... the flames... they&apos;ve drained me...
*Ifan looks at you with suspicion, and shakes his head.*
