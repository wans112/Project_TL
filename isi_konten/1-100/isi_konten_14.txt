I&apos;ve held onto this ever since my expulsion from the Forbidden City. I was going to open it upon my return, but this...
Traps
Poison Surfaces
*Your God stirs - pushing you to eat it. &apos;Do not fear,&apos; a voice whispers. &apos; Do what must be done...&apos;*
*He spares you but a glance, then turns his focus back on whatever it is he&apos;s hiding from.*
Shaman&apos;s Headdress
Letters
Maybe that&apos;s it. Or maybe years of fighting finally broke him. Your guess is good as mine. Although... I&apos;ve heard whispers.
It is about you. More so than anything else.
See you around.
*Admit you hear voices too, hiding in visions of ash.*
&apos;The Better Potion: Ailments Cured &amp; Boils Lanced.&apos;
*Ask for a discount.*
*The man sleeps so deeply he might as well be dead to the world.*
*Draw your weapon. That sounds like a great idea...*
This is no time for idle chit-chat!
Magister Executioner
So it was!
Wizard Pillar
A fine vintage, especially for a craft arsonist.
*Justinia&apos;s pounds a fist against her palm. One smack, then a second, then a third.*
That all?
&lt;i&gt;...with the he-man.&lt;/i&gt;
Rest assured, I appreciate your decision.
Golden Pendant
The witch&apos;s house is empty.
Your lies end here. Get him!
Yes, it&apos;s true that I served Lucian as best I could. I gave him what he asked. Would I do it again?
Female Lizard Skeleton
*She stops dead as you pull the jar out of your backpack. Her voice trembles as she speaks.*
*Tell him you aren&apos;t a Magister - not by a long shot.*
Be well, Prince. Good-bye.
*...you didn&apos;t think he had it in him.*
Bloody mercenaries... alright, pass freely.
The Thread
[LOHSE] *Sidle up beside her with a grin and say it&apos;ll be your little secret.*
*Sympathise and tell him a child shouldn&apos;t have to experience things like that.*
Do you wish to connect Online or Wireless?
Bloody delicious.
And what of you?
*Nod, you&apos;re pretty bad. The lizard caste system is strict and archaic, while the House of War is built on the blood of slaves.*
We&apos;ve got a boat ready to row to the Lady Vengeance. But if Alexandar sees us bobbing among the waves, we&apos;ll be shark chow.
Simple Amulet
*Look at him expectantly. You want to hear the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; reason he&apos;s red.*
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? An overgrown newt?
Ho!
And I&apos;m not sure you truly appreciate how long &apos;forever&apos; is...
It doesn&apos;t want you to know. It doesn&apos;t want you to hear its name.
First a taste, a morsel, then the meal...
Ward&apos;s Armour
[LIZARD] *Demand that the chest opens in the language of your people.*
It&apos;s &apos;in the beginning the word was with Lucian&apos;.
You know nothing of evil! The gods you follow are more foul than any Voidwoken.
That oughta get her talkin&apos;...
Wizard Leggings
*Refuse her. That is not the path you wish to take.*
*The God King whispers...*
*Inexplicable pity and hope gnaw at you. Let it go.*
That painting looks... familiar.
Ragged Leather Gloves
*Say you heartily agree.*
*Be on your way.*
This is no time for pranks. I know you as well as I know the doctor himself.
...but it wasn&apos;t this.
Spirit of Nurse Fa
*Smile and say you wouldn&apos;t miss Lucian&apos;s Day for the world either.*
The Voidwoken are defeated, but the Paladins all died.
*He reaches his arms overhead, stretching his lean frame. Not for the first time, you wonder how anyone&apos;s expected to concentrate on what they&apos;re doing with this man hanging around, exuding raw energy.*
[IFAN] *Say you do know. And suffering does not excuse her actions now. Consume her Source.*
*Unreadable glyphs mantle this ancient pillar. Braided through thick iron rings, Source-infused chains bind the dragon tightly.*
You pay the price for ignoring my warnings!
*The Magister stops, her face frozen and expressionless. She turns to you and loudly proclaims...*
Rhalic, God of Humans
*Ask what he means.*
*Nod. You&apos;ll join his cause.*
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle!
Something deep inside me welled up: a power I never knew I had. She simply froze under my stare.
You&apos;ll regret your crime for the rest of your life - or at least, for what&apos;s left of it!
*And who is he to watch over this carnage? Demand to know who you&apos;re talking to.*
*She smiles.*
That thing may be part of her, but it doesn&apos;t define her.
(not enough AP!)
&lt;i&gt;You helped the Doctor on Bloodmoon Island, yes? Some advice from him, in thanks... explore the gardens of Linder Kemm. An entrance to his vault of treasures lies hidden there...&lt;/i&gt;
I am Eternal.
Why are you here? Tell me, and mind that you tell me true.
I trust that our bargain reaches a... satisfactory conclusion.
Shouldn&apos;t have done that!
...but he did not drink, himself. &lt;i&gt;Poison&lt;/i&gt;. I did not realise until it was too late - none of us did.
I know that you were mortal once, but could you not have let their ignorance fall away with your flesh?
*His look turns to one of contempt.*
*The velvet fabric easily tears, exposing her bare shoulders and breasts.*
*Ifan whistles a matching tune and gives you an admiring glance as he takes back the crossbow.*
We found a shrine to the goddess Amadia.
&lt;i&gt;As for me...&lt;/i&gt;
It wasn&apos;t just sword and spear the Magisters used on us... no, they had these weapons. Living beings, depleted of Source and crucified... pathetic to look at, until, until...
Have you anything that will protect against Voidwoken?
*Tell him you&apos;ve had to do things you&apos;re not proud of, but you did them in order to survive.*
So now my work must continue... as soon as I&apos;ve gutted my quota of fish, of course. Farewell stranger!
Enough! We need to turn our attentions elsewhere. Come!
*You lay your hand the withered lizard remains. A chill caresses the back of your neck, and the breeze seems to carry an echoing moan...*
*In an instant, the rack lies empty once again, awaiting its next victim.*
[RED PRINCE] *Tell them neither of them is worthy of so much as a lizard&apos;s kiss.*
*Say you don&apos;t think so. Some ethereal figures calling themselves the gods keep trying to distract you from your purpose.*
*The man in the painting huffs and turns his head away.*
Sure you did. They were around you all the time. Anyway. My mom was really great. It&apos;s too bad for you you didn&apos;t know her.
But...shinies!
*The sharpshooter turns from his silent watch over the mill and its approaches, and holds you in a steady regard.*
&lt;i&gt;And you - human-&lt;/i&gt;rot? &lt;i&gt;Come to steal-&lt;/i&gt;feed-infect? &lt;i&gt;We have a vessel already.&lt;/i&gt;
the truth was: they just liked her.
We repaired the broken lever by placing a silver shaft in its mechanism.
I&apos;m sure enough for the both of us.
What?
Doubt it, now they&apos;ve got that hellacious general in charge. What do they call her? The Axe?
Campaign Description
A beggar demanded alms for his sick dog. What afflicts the mutt?
*She shoots you a questioning look, but resignation quickly wipes her face clean of curiosity.*
Damn! Mari didn&apos;t make it...
Brahmos is dead.
Hush.
We found a letter from a mysterious figure. It orders Mordus to kill Lohar.
Lesser Demon
I read a book last night, Brianna: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Claws of Deceit&apos; &lt;/i&gt;- you heard of it? Gave me shivers it did, what those Lone Wolves get up to.
*Smile. Tell him he&apos;s got you all curious now!*
*Tell him you&apos;re glad he found what he was looking for.*
Anything I can do to repay you? I could fetch some stuff you need, maybe? Ma always said I was a great runner.
You hear them, don&apos;t you? The little ones are everywhere. Worse than Magisters...
Summon Black Cat
Ryker&apos;s salamander didn&apos;t like us. If we could change its mind we might learn a thing or two about its master.
*He grins wider and laughs, but the good cheer doesn&apos;t quite reach his thoughtful eyes.*
It&apos;s too bad you couldn&apos;t be friends. I hope you and me can still be friends.
Your attention is appreciated, sir, but misplaced. You - *choke* &lt;i&gt;Kill! Kill the bastard! Wear his skin. Dance in his en-&lt;/i&gt;
We already had more than enough Godwoken.
I ache for battle!
The Meista&apos;s back! The Meista&apos;s back!
One of our party proved themselves pure and passed the Path of Blood.
*The onyx eyes, three-layered crown and feathered shoulders: you recognise her from the statues that stand tall in the desert sands. She is the goddess Zorl-Stissa, greatest of the Seven.*
*Look at the skull inquisitively - is it... normal for human remains to talk?*
We were part of a caravan headed to Fort Joy - shiny collars and all. Gareth and the Seekers ambushed the caravan and freed us. Saved every one of us from that hell.
Which of us is the night, and which the dark, I wonder? Well... whichever it is, I welcome the lack of light, brother.
Why are you sneaking about?
Boiled Potato
*Question Lucian&apos;s motives. Does he&lt;i&gt; truly &lt;/i&gt;seek the greater good?*
Beast believes Isbeil is twisting the Queen&apos;s mind to take the dwarves into a disastrous war.
*Wonder aloud if the box didn&apos;t just speak to you.*
There&apos;s no rush at all. What do you want to do?
Phase Conductor
*And what about the other races, ask.*
And I&apos;m done for, but you... you... there&apos;s still hope...
Of course it was a little less... destroyed in my day.
What is it? Haven&apos;t you distracted me enough...?
[SEBILLE] *Tell him to state his house.*
Potential combination
*The spirit nods, and its face grows even more tortured. It is trapped. Is this Ryker&apos;s doing?*
*You wake into what still seems to be a dream. The scent of home; the perfume you always associated with &lt;i&gt;her,&lt;/i&gt; the woman you&apos;ve dreamt of since birth.*
A stone king. Just as effective as a real one, I reckon.
*Tell him you&apos;ve half a mind to punch him in the face.*
Food has no taste, wine brings no joy, and flesh has no warmth.
&lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt; is the God King&apos;s current beloved. No more skin on his real bones than on a peeled jackfruit. And it is not only his ear the God King whispers into. The dwarf called Isbeil. She bends to the King&apos;s every whim.
Fah, you can keep yer antagonistical wotsits, and so can Death. &apos;f &apos;e comes near me, I&apos;ll rip &apos;is boney &apos;ead off.
*The troll leans in and glares at you with beady little eyes. His breath is like a butcher&apos;s offal bucket, left in the sun too long.*
*His eyes narrow. He bends for the coin...*
I&apos;d... I&apos;d say the same about you. I&apos;m never lonely when &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; around.
Halt! You hang around where you&apos;re not wanted. Only place you belong is a prison cell.
Magister Brute
Arhu was last seen at Kemm’s mansion. Kemm wanted to discuss access to Lucian’s crypt. A visit to the mansion may yield clues...
Oath Of Insanity
Rend Reality
The age of the Mother is over. The shackles of the past are broken. We shall take our rightful place in the new world.
*The younger one&apos;s eyes widen. The other remains stiff, as if bracing himself against an unseen wind.*
Use this to rest when there are no enemies nearby.
I blessed the very water beneath your feet. Now you may wield that power for yourself: a first taste of things to come, for this is only the beginning.
*Tell him he&apos;s crazy! He&apos;s about to follow this woman? That wagon of hers could be full of assassins!*
*If this mystery Dreamer wants to speak with you, you suppose you should follow the spirit wherever he may lead.*
Investigate the caves.
&lt;i&gt;*Thud.&lt;/i&gt; The sound grows louder. &lt;i&gt;Thud. &lt;/i&gt;Stronger. &lt;i&gt;Thud. &lt;/i&gt;There you are. There you are.*
