Birds Desert 03
[SEBILLE] *Smile. He was a slave as well. You&apos;re beginning to understand.*
*Say you met her son on the other side of the bridge; he asked you to help her.*
*The squirrel reaches out and hands you a piece of bark, covered in tiny, scratched handwriting.*
*Sometimes, you really wonder about how you make choices in life. Sometimes, like now.*
You ssserve the great &lt;i&gt;Almira?!&lt;/i&gt; The Sssallow Man will want to ssspeak with you. Take thisss...
We overcame all obstacles and survived the Death Room. We stand on the steps of Lucian&apos;s final resting place. Is Dallis here too?
Ashwood Branch
*Refuse, saying you&apos;re not in the habit of helping Magisters - alive or dead.*
As soon as we convince this heap of wood to move.
Phoenix
Shht! &lt;i&gt;Pray!&lt;/i&gt;
She&apos;s lost. Bewildered. A stranger in her own soul, desperately trying to find her way home.
The Sallow Man&apos;s Hand
*Say you&apos;ll consider his request. That is the best you can do for now.*
Prince! The consulate no longer burns. I presume you have had a hand in this feat - and if not, please accept my gratitude in any case.
Vulture&apos;s Prayer
An entire race of deities, with a perfect understanding of the universe...
Caught him red-handed trying to make off with a second crate after he took the first. *Ahem* Went down like a rent boy when we grabbed him. Easy.
*Tell him you promised the portal-master you&apos;d help her. He and his Magisters need to leave.*
We need to travel across the land, gathering clues, experimenting with different magics, and coming up with a spell to shield Rivellon from its doom.

SON OF A -
The same reason my father and I did everything... to protect the realm. As that is what the Divine is &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;.
*Wonder why she decided to settle in such a desolate place.*
I won&apos;t tell you again, dwarf - back off.
Do you think this is a game?! Lives are at stake! Come to me when you have something worth saying.
Hey!
*Ask her how old she is.*
&lt;i&gt;(Geraldine!)&lt;/i&gt;
[UNDEAD] *Shrug. Do your empty skulls contain brains? How deep could his thoughts possibly be?*
[1] increases your damage with crushing weapons by [2]%.
*Her glowing cheeks are as the sun after storm! Ask what has her in such good spirits.*
Braveheart
No, don&apos;t leave. Stay here, with me. Rest.
Melee Weapon
*Say you&apos;d like to know more about trolls after all.*
I&apos;d say &apos;your guess is as good as mine&apos;, &apos;cept I&apos;ve got the sense not to ask any questions. Now why don&apos;t you waft on, elf? I&apos;ve work to do.
Welcome home, Lohse. Come to Daddy.
Welcome! Move your characters with [LeftStick].
I... guess I wish you luck. This isn&apos;t going to be easy. Only one of us will come out of it with what we want. I hope that it&apos;s me. But I wish we could have done this together. Really, I do.
If there&apos;s nothing else, we have a lot to do...
Why wouldn&apos;t I be? Every so often, some interloper goes and undoes one of Braccus Rex&apos;s curses, and I must murder the poor sod.
And who would&apos;ve thought it? You&apos;re sure not the collared weirdo I first met, that&apos;s for sure! You belong to Rivellon now.
The Scion attacked us.
Unlock
*Ask it how it died.*
Good. But be warned, if I suspect you are doing anything other than fetching the will, you can be sure the guards will know about it.
Mor the Trenchmouthed
*So he&apos;s Ryker&apos;s prisoner? Offer your sympathies.*
Many items and adventures are hidden off the beaten path.
Potions and poultices. Tell me what you seek.
Stewart
Where&apos;s a trusty tap when you need one?
*The man nods, chastened.*
The spores grow in what soil they are given. More reason to keep them from the Magisters.
To lock away the problem is simply to admit failure. What we see here is intellectual defeat: the child of stupidity.
Gather the ingredients for the Godwoken ritual.
Shush, Fedor. You, Mister Lookalike. If you think of anything you &lt;i&gt;forgot&lt;/i&gt; to tell us... visit Reimond at the docks. On in with you!
The crumpled note is covered in numbers and letters, written in a long, curling hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15R 34L 23R 35R 9R 16L 33L 45R 51L 1L
*The man doesn&apos;t react - he&apos;s out cold.*
*His eyes narrow, his gaze sharp.*
The Doctor favours you. Go freely.
*Ask how you might find her again.*
Leave me to my work now. Maybe I can find something to back up your claims... and make it so that her suffering wasn&apos;t in vain...
Rise!
I... knew we must be here. I am not sure how much to explain. You are here, and so we are here.
[1] cast [2] on the ground
Heh. I know it&apos;s the truth - but still stings to hear it comin&apos; from your lips. It&apos;s jus&apos; - jus&apos; that I didn&apos;t always feel anyone was ever listenin.&apos;
*Turn on her. This was wrong - she was wrong. And now, she must pay.*
I don&apos;t know how you do it! Hearing your stories inspires me to embark on yet another thrill-chase!
Chance to knock down.
*Say that he&apos;s doing a splendid job guarding the cave, and you&apos;ll be sure to praise his efforts to whoever lies within, if he just were to let you past...*
*Say that it was transported from the sea to here through a portal. The shore isn&apos;t far from here though.*
*Ask him about Lohar. What&apos;s his role in all this?*
Anyhow - we&apos;re a team now, so the &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; is not half as important as the &lt;i&gt;us.&lt;/i&gt;
*She pauses, considering your response - and sighs with relief.*
I&apos;ve been bombarded with a lot of grandiloquent prophecies that an analytical mind like mine is obliged to meet with a certain degree of scepticism.
A &apos;no&apos; doesn&apos;t become a &apos;yes&apos; over time, you know.
I&apos;m not afraid of &lt;i&gt;it &lt;/i&gt;as much as I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know what &lt;i&gt;it &lt;/i&gt;is.
Ought to keep well out of sight of the Magisters...
*It painstakingly attempts to flap its spindly wings, failing miserably.*
*She glimmers in and out of view, merging with the shadows. Crowing, she slams your hand down into the table, hard enough to draw blood.*
There was no manipulation, you volunteered of your own free will! Besides, this work is important! You should be glad, to have played a part in the betterment of all of Rivellon.
When all your life revolves around a single purpose, one can&apos;t help but feel lost, I would think, when that purpose is fulfilled. Its achievement doesn&apos;t satisfy so much as it disillusions.
*Grin and tell her you&apos;ll see what you can do.*
&lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;will be the judge of that!

Shelter
We Seven have stood united against the Void since the beginning of time. Now, I fear I must turn to another.
Not long before this thing snaps into splinters!
*Gareth&apos;s head is steady but his face is pale and his eyes are lost.*
*Say you survived the Voidwoken attack by the skin of your teeth. He should really find somewhere safer to go.*
I will remain here, and guard my offspring.
I have something for you. When we have Saheila&apos;s attention, I thank you properly.
Medusa Head
I must say, you created quite a stir earlier, dear Fane. The other lords and I were quite impressed with your research.
A dirty move like that has only one proper answer!
With &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt; Not so much, I&apos;m fine up here...
Pull the spear
Debuff Wits Potion
The Great Acorn is nearly here. Its servants are poised for impact.
Knight of Xantezza
Well, settle in then. No point heading into the city - gates&apos;re closed. Voidwoken. &lt;i&gt;In&lt;/i&gt; the city. I never thought I&apos;d see the day.
I shouldn&apos;t expect more, I guess. But I&apos;m so tired of having to settle for &lt;i&gt;less.&lt;/i&gt;
Please... not like this...
Magister Gheist
*As the flame gutters out, a voice cries out in anger. The spirit of Prudence, you know, bound for oblivion. And then she is gone.*
*She places a hand on the side of your face and looks into your eyes, a bittersweet smile on her lips.*
Every time. Every time, Godwoken! Why. Can&apos;t. I. Just. KILL YOU?
Cobalt
I can see what you&apos;re up to. Keep your hands to yourself!
Magister Timery
He&apos;s... he&apos;s just a child...
Strategic waiting. Don&apos;t remember inviting you, though.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;You are no Child of Duna. Leave now, or face his wrath.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Ifan nods and raises his eyebrows, a slight smile brightening his face.*
Here. Take this key, and head on up the stairs. You&apos;ll find Kniles room there. He&apos;d want to know his fine things weren&apos;t languishing unappreciated in his old room.
Contrast
*A shocked awareness spreads across his face, and he lunges towards you, just as the hanging Sourcerer breaks free of his bond.*
*You guessed it, Jimmy is dead as a door nail.*
Well then. You have done us a service. I must find the others and get the hell of this godsdamned island. I suggest you do the same.
Warrior Voice
Listen up. Back off.
Listen to me demon. I know why you chose her. I know what it is you fear the most and therefore desire the most. But I&apos;ll not let her serve you any longer!
[SEBILLE] *Tell them it&apos;s best to stick to the devil you know.*
Traps: Gas Pits
*Ask where she&apos;d had it last.*
Hear me, Prince! I will not be ignored!
The price, I&apos;m afraid, is not negotiable. And believe me, this really is one exceptional kin lover. Are you sure you wouldn&apos;t care to change your mind?
Good. Take my knowledge, and use it wisely on your path, Godwoken.
The Seven created the world we know - they created &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;. We owe them.
There&apos;s been a murder. A Sourcerer was killed by one of your own. Lucky you were busy getting your collar fitted at the time, or you&apos;d be a suspect like the rest of &apos;em.
&lt;i&gt;Freedom!&lt;/i&gt; About time, too. I can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;tell &lt;/i&gt;you how long Mordus has been draining me. I&apos;m absolutely &lt;i&gt;famished&lt;/i&gt; for Source and sinew.
Creates a [2]m [1] surface at the location of your target(s)
I never read dis stuff before. Them Magisters use a lotta big words.
*He shakes like a dead leaf in the wind as you blow him a kiss.*
I promise that yours alone will be the powers of the lake, and to the lake I will lead you, but not yet. Not until you&apos;ve become a true Master of the Source: until you speak the language of creation itself.
Chief...
Thank you, thank you! You&apos;re so good - so kind - so brave! And so... &lt;i&gt;wiry!&lt;/i&gt;
There were no stars that night. She sat shivering beside a fire. I was nervous, I had to chase her. My hand hated itself, tried to resist, but there is no resisting the Master&apos;s song.
You were warned. To arms!
I see the good in you, I see the bad in you, I see the all of you.
Ungh... I guess when I said &apos;never again&apos;, I really meant &apos;once or twice more&apos;.
Rory. The rrraaaaat. He&apos;s just over there. Don&apos;t blink or he&apos;ll flit right past. Like a... like a rraaaaaat.
The people of Rivellon will call you their Saviour. The power is in them. In all of them. And there will come a time when they rebel - and the price will be high.
*White as Driftwood salt, the dwarf flinches at your approach yet she holds a short, clean blade aloft. Her fierce stance can&apos;t hide the trembling of her fingers.*
*Wonder aloud what you could do with such a rare find...*
By leaving me stranded among those red-robes with their prickly magic sticks, you mean?
Maybe this one...
