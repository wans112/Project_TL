*She leans into you and kisses you passionately, her forked tongue probing...*
I hadn&apos;t realised I was in such illustrious company when we met before. Most fascinating, the things I&apos;ve been hearing about you...
As far as tracking him down is concerned... right now, we&apos;re headed for Driftwood. And last I heard, my old pack were camped out near there. If anyone&apos;ll know who put out the contract on Godwoken... it&apos;ll be Roost.
She told me the design was brilliant. When the armour was forged, the Empress showed it to me, and - and - she trapped me inside. Consumed me.
*Tell it that you feel its loss profoundly.*
*The bed receives you both, you realise that you are naked and so is she...*
Griff releases me if he sees I do not have what he misses. We - &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;- must find who steals them.
*Ask it what it thinks its role will be, once you&apos;re Divine.*
Go to her, your majesty! Find her and safeguard her - for her sake, and that of your children!
Pet Power
Iron Key for Thieves&apos; Guild Chest
Ever since Kemm ordered the attack on the Magisters, the Divine Order has been tearing itself apart. One almost feels safer behind bars.
*Reach out and touch the tablet.*
Yet all is just facade, a frail shell...
There&apos;s a device hidden in the Path of Blood, left from the statue of Lucian. Activate it by using the Source-charged amulet and reading the words from the Scoll.
*Ask if it&apos;s possible to leave this place.*
We need that ship. Everything rests on this battle.
...and exhale.
With the brazier riddle solved, four elven challengers rose to attack us.
It takes a little while to kick in. See me when you&apos;re in Driftwood, we&apos;ll talk about those recipes.
*Tell the dwarf to keep his underpants, by all means.*
Don&apos;t tell anyone where you got this, eh?
A new Divine rose, a true heir to the Seven, more powerful than ever, and united Rivellon in its battle against the Void. All across the realm she was loved, worshipped and adored. Humans, lizards, elves and dwarves all rallied to her banner. The great allegiance stood once more, but the war raged on.
Oh yes? Well - I certainly could use some good news amongst the bad. I am a man of my word. Here is the payment promised.
For your trouble.
*An emblem of the sun glows faintly on the altar, but all you can hear is the hiss and rumble of the volcano and the creak of your bones.*
Can freeze a target and does [1].
*There&apos;s no woman she &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be. Tell her she can let go off the past if she so wishes.*
Dwarves Unite!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brothers! Sisters! For TOO LONG the Order have kept our kind down. Toiling in THEIR salt mines or THEIR fish factory or THEIR oilfields. No more! We must rise UP!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We must take back the pride in ourselves that is our SOLEMN BIRTHRIGHT! Join us! Join the Driftwood Militia!
Lizard lady. Impeccable robes. Came by here one day, saying she could sense the Source. She could help Gwyd, she said. He took to her right away. Soon, the Voidwoken came. And then the Magisters started knocking...
Cursed Source
*Observe that he did a pretty terrible job of protecting Alexandar...*
And so you make cowards of us all!
*Comment that there can only be so many places to look.*
Call me what you like. After all, neither of us have shied from playing the villain, have we? I&apos;m not nice. I&apos;m just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Forty-three, give or take.
It feels so... so &lt;i&gt;heavy &lt;/i&gt;here. Let&apos;s not linger.
You did well. They did not all die.
Well look at that. You have a deal. Now be gone, before someone catches wind of this.
*Tell him he can&apos;t stay here. It isn&apos;t safe, and he can&apos;t protect himself.*
It&apos;s too - it&apos;s too &lt;i&gt;tight!&lt;/i&gt;
Letter from Lohar
There&apos;s a... see there&apos;s this... woman... I&apos;m not crazy! And if she &lt;i&gt;kisses &lt;/i&gt;you, she can &lt;i&gt;change &lt;/i&gt;you.
*...and realise you&apos;ve made your last mistake. Your throat constricts, acid burns your guts, you heart slows to a halt. You slump forward. A kin appears. A Lone Wolf. She takes your book. But you&apos;re already dead.*
*Say you&apos;ll do your best to put Gareth on the right path.*
*He stretches out his arms and legs, yawning the entire while. He pats his bedroll and rests his head in the dimple left behind, then smiles at you. Indeed, he is most comfortable...*
So! Three questions asked, three questions answered. Let&apos;s evaluate, shall we?
*Tell her your curiosity is piqued. What &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; these Sourcerous Sundries?*
Odasto
To see her taken away from me now, after our first meeting... it rends the heart.
*Fane takes your hand, interlocking his fingers with yours.*
Ramn Oak
What would you like me to say? I know you&apos;re the Red Prince. You know you&apos;re the Red Prince. Why should we discuss it?
This dough is fairly bursting with its desire to be baked into a warm, comforting apple pie.
*Say she&apos;s right. You&apos;ll remember that for next time.*
*The spirit&apos;s mouth drops open in horror, but it doesn&apos;t even have a chance to utter a scream...*
It doesn&apos;t matter in any case. The path is opened. Go freely.
*Ask what happened here - it looks like chaos.*
Bah! You are the fetid dirt on my boot. You are nothing at all. &lt;b&gt;I am the Source King! I SHALL RULE!&lt;/b&gt;
*Close your eyes and pull away, you don&apos;t want to witness what&apos;s next.*
Ha! You pay for trying such an old trick on me!
I hear we owe you for saving us from the Sourcerer that paraded himself as a tinkerer. My thanks.
Hero
Ah, the threads are coming back together now. You, Sourcerer... you helped me, I should help &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
*Step forward and tell them that no-one here is trotting off to a demonic plane. No-one.*
A forest &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; will plant, Sebille.
We&apos;ll find them. Or we&apos;ll find another way.
Roost&apos;s Hand
[SCHOLAR] *A red lizard... That can only mean one thing: he&apos;s the notorious Red Prince!*
*Ask what he did to earn such a punishment.*
*As you stretch your hand towards the jar, your collar &lt;i&gt;burns &lt;/i&gt;your neck, a searing pain. The collar will not allow you to absorb this soul.*
What? How dare you! Stop wasting my time and stab me, you fool!
I thought I knew him. Clearly I didn&apos;t.
*Put the needle away.*
Borris? That&apos;s the fellow I already met near the main gate.
Aye, and sportin&apos; a face with more gems than you&apos;ve mites. Braccus&apos;d see us made emperors before he locks away a prize like that.
Yes. I see you clearly now.
Lucian&apos;s teeth - where is that runt hiding...
*Ask about the instruments she makes.*
Can&apos;t start the game because we need at least two players!
Bloated Corpse
Giant Thunder Rune Of Power
Onion
I see you.
*His hands shake. He clears his throat.*
*The spirit of a young woman stares at the body of the dead potion-maker. She looks delighted. She turns and gives you a smile of triumph... then fades away, gone to the Halls.*
Jolly Justinia! Queen of the dwarves! Ha! Scourge, more like!
*She scuffs one boot in the ashen dust at her feet, and gazes off to the far horizon.*
This place had it coming. They brought the Void upon themselves.
*Say nothing.*
*The woman&apos;s face carries a strange expression, one of expectation mixed with... sorrow.*
The consulate lies in ruin. Accursed flames lap at every corner. The Paladins are great and faithful warriors, but some tragedies even they can&apos;t undo.
Well, well, well. And does the object of your affection feel the same about you?
Who is hunting us and why?
Fiery Protector
*Say nothing.*
*Say her complicity in the death of thousands earns her the Void. Consume her Source.*
Fuligin
Ahem. Fine. You get the gist, though. So here&apos;s the thing: where there&apos;s a sea, there&apos;s boats. Boom! Simple as that! We&apos;ll find one docked, or one&apos;ll sail by, and... well, as you probably figured, I&apos;m good at stealin&apos; boats.
Talk to the sole survivor.
The salamander can only speak a rare lizard dialect.
*Ask if it is Dallis&apos; cat.*
The girl doesn&apos;t know who she is. Perhaps we can trigger her memory.
[NOBLE] *Say that you agree with him wholeheartedly.*
Djinn&apos;s Scimitar
Default
*A sequence of numbers have been engraved on the face of the mechanism - 1 3 2 4. Below this are four dials.*
Countless times since your birth have I, and so many Dreamers with me, foiled the attempts of your enemies to assassinate your royal person.
Without you, we&apos;d be dead on that beach. My thanks, Fane.
That&apos;s all I needed to hear! Just don&apos;t let that caged rascal fool you. You can&apos;t trust him as far as you can throw him!
Dead...? Dammit! Dammit to the Void! Wainslow deserved better than that...
*Walk on with your head held high.*
Hey - everything okay?
Gravitas
You&apos;re sweet, you know that?
You gotta pick who you can trust.
You shouldnt&apos;a given the Reds that letter. You don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve done.
Strike(s)
Magma Cave - Burning River
Keep your hands to yourself. I won&apos;t warn you again.
No. You are no thief. No &lt;i&gt;Magister. &lt;/i&gt;
*Step away. This whole thing sounds like trouble.*
And I trust that you merely delay my vengeance, not deny it outright.
I had hoped they would help me convince the King of his error, but before they or I could act, I was arrested and-...
They sank our ship, so now we&apos;re taking theirs - move out!
*The skeleton extends his arm, jiggling the heart towards you. A glob of dark yellow pus oozes through the bones of his palm and drips to the ground.*
*She turns back to the forest, her bow held at the ready.*
I know you can hear me.
Jahan the demon-hunter never stopped hunting for demons.
*Lean casually against the barrel and quietly ask why the Magisters are looking for him.*
*The lizard&apos;s hand lashes out, the palm landing flat on your forehead. You feel a cold pain start to spread across your skull but, deep within you, something stirs.*
Axe Of Atrocities
Void Shard
*Say that you really enjoyed your time in the hold. Or library. Or... wherever you were, exactly.*
Blood Rose
You&apos;re not going any further, buddy.
But... something ain&apos;t right. There&apos;s something still amiss.
*Stand your ground.*
*Her thought trails off to muttering. She waves you away.*
Poems of Power, by Cranley Huwbert
Ha! &lt;i&gt;You?!&lt;/i&gt;
Thou wilt not turn thy back on me, flesh!
Who could have crafted such wonders?
I admire your enthusiasm, but I&apos;m just about to close the Gallery for the evening. You&apos;ll have to return in the morning.
Willy&apos;s Contract
You don&apos;t need me to tell you that was the right decision. Those were &lt;i&gt;people.&lt;/i&gt;
Challenge Murga.
*She grins and takes your chin softly in her hand, parting your lips. She comes close to your mouth, so close, then licks your lips. Once... twice...*
Well, I admit it ain&apos;t my best, but I figgered you&apos;d tired of hearin&apos; the usual shanties. Though I know them ones, too. No shortage of Beast ballads out there, if&apos;n you&apos;d rather hear one of the classics.
F8
With Lucian in power, Saheila took the elves away from the world. They grew strong once more, amidst the trees of the re-grown home forest. Some say her plans for revenge will bring about the end of days.
*Say that they&apos;re very lucky to have such a talented Sourcerer with them.*
Se... bille...
You already used this skill in this combat.
*Put on your friendliest voice, whatever that is. Ask straight out - is the Queen in Arx?*
Have you seen signs of battle? Did you encounter our Magister brothers and sisters?
