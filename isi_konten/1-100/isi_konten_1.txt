We agreed to help Hannag against the Magisters.
Well if it ain&apos;t so-and-so! Ha - just kidding. We&apos;re good together, like sea salt &apos;n&apos; taties, or jam on sweetbread. Y&apos;care to team up? I&apos;d say your stew could use a bit of Beastly flavour, if ya catch my meanin&apos;.

So ask and let me go!
*Nods.*
I sense a menace in the air here. Let us watch our steps.
They - they fed me to their young. They chewed on my flesh as I screamed.
*She sips her drink.*
I&apos;ll happily recite for you... for a little discount? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])

You sure you wanna know?
Players have different game versions. Please ensure you&apos;re up-to-date!

Moving to noxious atmosphere enabler!
*The painted man mumbles and grumbles.*
[FANE] *Say that it&apos;s a little lifeless.*
I saw great potential in our new divinity. I don&apos;t expect to be disappointed.
I... I suppose I really like spending time with you. What&apos;s meant most to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; on our journey?
Whether what the Gods did was right can wait. The Void won&apos;t. We have to press on.
Yes? Is it an audience you desire?
The Magisters rewarded us for our help.
Evidence Chest
*The figure slowly shakes his head.*
Didja see &apos;em? You did, right? Those claws! Wonder what&apos;s behind the masks, too. Can&apos;t be pretty.
A Scholar from Times Past
Now, now, you tricky little so-and-so. You may have gotten rid of me once before, but you&apos;ll find I&apos;m most persistent! Now, come on, you know what I&apos;m after:
You die not in the fog. You die not here.
Well, if you can&apos;t keep a civil tongue in your head, my princelings are hungry and mama must feed them. And oh, just &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; at that healthy flush in your cheeks...
They used to be blue. Oh well.
The moody type, are we? A pity. Something should light your way on darker days, wouldn&apos;t you say?
Godwoken! The Mother Tree calls you. Follow the spirit. Climb to the heart of the tree. The Mother awaits.
*Tell the lizard you like her song.*
Condition? What do you mean?

Why, everything, of course. You don&apos;t know the most of a person until you&apos;ve seen the worst of them.
Mihaly understands who I am. That&apos;s why we&apos;re meant to be together.
Try again
A Sourcerer fugitive was hiding here - some of the locals were stupid enough to help him. We got a tip-off, but he wasn&apos;t willing to go quietly...
I- I don&apos;t know. I am trying, of course, but how does one battle a power like the Great Acorn?
I&apos;m what now?
Are you sure you want to delete [1]?

Terri&apos;le things! Everything&apos;ll go &lt;i&gt;&apos;oom! &lt;/i&gt;Don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest! DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
This is bad... and you know who&apos;ll get the worst of it, elf? The common man. Same old tune, every time...

This thick, tarnished ring would be easy to confuse for a cheap steel ornament.
...vapid fiction. Along with a large helping of ham.
Thank you! We should make good on our escape, you know. I have to see a man about a wolf in the Hollow Marshes.
Go no farther! You are warned.
*Shake your head.*
Plenty. These tainted fish are causing a lot of hardship. If I can understand what&apos;s happening to them, perhaps there&apos;ll be a way to reverse the effects...

*You&apos;ve been through so much together, don&apos;t let this divide you. If he supports you, he will be your right hand.*
Wait. This is important. I&apos;ll make it fast.
Another?! How do you have so much power...?
It&apos;s good to bake again. With the war, I haven&apos;t made a pie in... must be five years now. But Magister Reimond&apos;s visiting and that man just loves a good apple pie.

Taylia
Oh, my darling, there&apos;s no need to fret. Look at you, you&apos;re strong and valiant and powerful. I should be paying you!
Please accept this token of gratitude, and fare thee well.
Blackroot Plant
Hmm, I&apos;m sure there must be a safety switch down here somewhere...

If a fraction of the good sea&apos;s luck have you, this will be the last we meet.
Incredible.
An odd question. She is my queen. All dwarves are but players in her game. I don&apos;t question her will.
Not lost... taken. All our memories, everything the Ancestor Trees knew... our seed for the future. &lt;i&gt;Stolen &lt;/i&gt;from us.
I&apos;m more concerned about who the target&apos;s going to be.
*Grunt. That&apos;s all you need to know - you&apos;re done with him now.*
*Say it&apos;s time to stop doing what Lucian would want, and to start doing what &lt;i&gt;Gareth&lt;/i&gt; wants.*
*Look at him inquisitively. He left everything he had... to the pig?*
Nonsense! Come: sit, sit! We are pilgrims, and pilgrims share, no matter what!
Elodi
After all that, you don&apos;t have the money? You waste my time. It won&apos;t happen again. I have paying customers to attend to. Paying customers with money.
Isn&apos;t it time for another... snack?
Cultivated and exported from the equator by expert Lizard horticulturists before being corrupted by poison.
*Gently ask her if she might know where to find him.*
I would undo it if I could! Oh, I surely would, I surely would, &lt;i&gt;but I cannot!&lt;/i&gt; Only the Master. &lt;i&gt;Only the Master can!&lt;/i&gt;
Look at that wand! It hums with inner Source...
The Gods have been keeping secrets from us. What else haven&apos;t they told us...?
