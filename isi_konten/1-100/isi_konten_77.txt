I&apos;ve been asking myself the same thing! I was just enjoying some stew in the tavern, reading over my latest acquisitions, and then I was surrounded by Magisters.
Your god wants me dead. My... god...? Devil...? Who knows...? It wants &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; It&apos;s getting stronger, and I need to outpace it.
Out in the garden. Beautiful sight - &apos;til the Voidwoken showed up. It... it was a Godsdamned bloodbath.
Our orders are to hold the town, so we hold. The Voidwoken be damned.
Are you moon-touched? Don&apos;t speak to me!
*He looks you lovingly in the eyes.*
The Divine held his ground, if barely. Desperate, the people pray for the rise of a new Godwoken once more.
I&apos;ve gotta get out of this deathtrap!
Magister Dayva
*Amadia stirs, pouring out of you as a thick steam, rushing towards Zorl-Stissa in a wave, dousing the flames as she goes.*
*Lohar rubs his forehead beneath his hood and stares at the ground. As you approach, his face hardens and he stands at his full height.*
I&apos;ll die before I&apos;ll let &apos;em do that to Butter.
It&apos;s a fair claim... the Divine cherished the notion of being pure - being free from sin, like an innocent child. I&apos;m afraid that such... &lt;i&gt;goodness &lt;/i&gt;is beyond most of us, however.
&lt;i&gt;My time is done. But you - your Source burns so bright I&apos;m all but blinded by it. Be wise and true, Godwoken. I am no hero. But wisdom and truth - these are values I always believed in.&lt;/i&gt;
Giant Insect Talk
Oh come on! This is the trip of a lifetime! Fortune favours the brave and all that! Okay fine. Come back later. I&apos;ll be here.

Hydrosophist
Isn&apos;t that what you are? A fully-formed elf, all ancestor trees and songs around the corpse-fire and all...
&apos;West - Kemm Mansion&lt;br&gt;North - Ancient Empire Consulate&lt;br&gt;East - City Gates&apos;
What do you think? Is Arx the right location?
Sounds like you hit your head a little too hard in that last fight.
After a very public blunder,
*She spins the axe towards you.*
*Tell him he has you pegged wrong. You&apos;re not looking to make waves.*
I was freed of the God King&apos;s terrible tyranny.
Eternal Plaque
Won&apos;t you miss home?
*Tell him to stay put here for now.*
They were right about me... I&apos;m just another useless elf...
Wizard&apos;s Hat Agaric
*Take your leave.*
Sure Roost&apos;ll love to hear it. You know where he&apos;s at? Him and the boys are camped out at an abandoned sawmill not too far from here.

*You swear you hear Gareth&apos;s pulse, galloping faster than a saddled mount. You&apos;ve never heard of such a thing before, but you suspect Gareth&apos;s heart is close to tearing.*
I&apos;m... I&apos;m grateful. Grateful to be alive, grateful to have had a family I called my own.
It&apos;s really uncanny, you know! Though I guess Flora looks like one &apos;a them now. All skinny &apos;n&apos; pale &apos;n&apos; all...
*Stay silent and look around, whistling softly. You don&apos;t talk to doors... people would think you are &lt;i&gt;mad.*&lt;/i&gt;

Electrified
&apos;ere, Mister ben-Mezd, you&apos;re a killer and a good one, so tell me this; you ever tear a person&apos;s throat out with your teeth?
You&apos;re welcome to whatever you can find.
Madness...
Find a cell for her.
I may be all that&apos;s wrong with the world but I&apos;m not yet ready to make the supreme sacrifice.
Get her, Dallis! Get that Sourcerer!
*The intense-looking man stands beside you against the thugs, shooting you an appraising glance.*
*The dwarf flashes a malevolent smirk at the Magister.*
At the centre of elvendom lies the Mother Tree. This tree, it seems, stands on the Nameless Isle.
We found an ancient tablet deep beneath the Blackpits. It seemed to bear pictographs of how to construct some sort of scythe. An odd thing to keep down here - perhaps it&apos;s more important than it looks.
*Ask her what she&apos;s doing here - what is she searching for?*
*The queen wrinkles her face and gives Isbeil a sideways glance. Isbeil&apos;s red-brown eyes meet her gaze head-on.*
No leaves. No trees. No soil. This is horrific!
Flower Pot
Spattered with acid and smelling none too clean, this book purports to teach the reader how to craft a Cursed Poison Flask.
I can rid you of your... little friend.
Now, can we get down to the fighting? I was enjoying a lovely dirt nap before you helped those heretical pigs.
Oh, but look at her. You&apos;re no girl, are you, my dear? You knew exactly what you were doing.
*The spirit of Prudence resists the coming of the dark. You feel her terror, her rage, and then - nothing.*
*Leave the skeleton be.*
I&apos;ve seen too much to be taken in by your lies. You die here and now.
I know.
My colleagues and I worked on different safeguards for the Divine&apos;s tomb in isolation, do you understand? &lt;i&gt;None of us &lt;/i&gt;had the full sequence needed to enter. If I tell you what I know, you&apos;ll still need to learn more from Lord Arhu, and &lt;i&gt;even then &lt;/i&gt;you wouldn&apos;t have the full picture - the others are dead!
*Take offence. Tell him that Rhalic deems you worthy of divinity!*
The trials do not kill me, but neither do I triumph. Another becomes Divine, and I remain here to serve Tir-Cendelius and protect his chosen.

Ophelia Voodoo Doll
*Persuade the spirit to travel to the Hall of Echoes.*
You&apos;re right. I owe them that... I owe them &lt;i&gt;at least &lt;/i&gt;that...
*The girl&apos;s black eyes follow your gaze. Her lips curl into a fiendish grin. She lifts her hands and licks blood - not her own - off her fingertips.*
Smells of lavender and charred flesh.
I don&apos;t see what else it could be.
And yet he escapes justice. The homelands are barren and unlivable. I cannot change it. But maybe I can understand.
Lucian was still alive, Dallis was actually an Eternal working with the Divine to end Divinity, and all of us were betrayed by Braccus Rex - who very nearly gave the world to the Void, before we defeated him. The final choice on the destination of Divinity fell... to us.
[SEBILLE] *Agree. You sense new powers on the horizon. In time you will become unstoppable.*
Go.
It&apos;s shut tight!
What a coincidence, me too. You helped me out just there, so let me return the favour. You want to get out of here?
No-one can make this decision for you. It has to be &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Remark that you&apos;ve never seen a creature like him, and ask where he came from.*
This has gone even better than I&apos;d planned.
*Let Amadia continue. She&apos;s right, curiosity should never be restricted - wherever it leads.*
*Step away from the device.*
[BARBARIAN] *Holler to the heavens. You will take what you want. &lt;i&gt;You are not the God King&apos;s servant!*&lt;/i&gt;
*Let him live.*
They turned the cart, pulled us out by our hair. We... we lost Farray. Landin and I beat the rest back, but not before one of &apos;em got me across the eyes.
The criminal Lohar asked us to search his associate Mordus&apos; house on the edge of Driftwood.
Soon the Seven will be nothing but morsels in the maws of the Void, unless you do as I bid you; do what I blessed you for!

Character is pretending to be dead, biding their time - and their skills! - and making enemies lose interest.

[SCHOLAR] *Note that the red upon the canvas is a very particular shade... that of blood.*
Too late. The spark&apos;s been snuffed. I trust you come bearing gold or godhood for me, to have interrupted such a sensitive interrogation.
Amateur Sword
*Very well, you agree.*
Back to the books, I suppose.
I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a monster! I&apos;m&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a monster! &lt;/i&gt;I&apos;m just a little boy who&apos;s being himself, just like his father told him. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a monster! I&apos;m&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not!&lt;/i&gt;
*Insist he speak his mind. You want to hear what he knows and that&apos;s that!*
No worse than a Deathfog nightmare: ichor and madness and then it&apos;s all over...
Quercus and I, we have - we have come across this cult before. We have seen what they can do.

YOUR TURN
*Summon elemental magic against the relic.*
A Voidwoken tunnel! It may lead us to safety!
*Tell him the Magisters are waiting outside. If he comes unarmed they won&apos;t harm him.*
Slowdown FreeCamera speed
Deep in the vaults beneath the Magister barracks, we found a large chamber. Did Reimond flee here?
Please, forgive the state of my garb, kin. I barely escaped the consulate with my life, no thanks to the Order&apos;s supposedly elite Paladins.&lt;br&gt;
Alright, alright, easy now. You seem sweet, but I&apos;m more curious about &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;than a bunch of cheesy lines.
I could. And I am asking &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; to do it. Or would you abandon me as Lucian has, after providing you shelter, after leading you to safer shores? My trust in Jonathan, my trust in the lost Divine - both betrayed. Am I to be betrayed &lt;i&gt;again?&lt;/i&gt;
Slim Sword
*Wonder about the &apos;foreign folk&apos; he mentioned.*
*Note that Higba seems well. The not-hiding-in-a-barrel look suits him.*
*Play along, and say that you feel it. Boy, do you ever!*
*Readdress the topic of the fare.*
Ho, pilgrim. May Lucian return.
*You were lovers. You wouldn&apos;t mind if you could be lovers still.*
*Remain silent.*
Breastplate, closed helmet, shield: all futile. I could serve a knight like him a thousand deaths regardless.
&lt;i&gt;...dead!&lt;/i&gt;
Sourcerer! Slay her, before she lures in Voidwoken!
*Tell her you may hold the key to fixing all that has gone wrong, but you need Arhu&apos;s help. She has everything to gain and nothing to fear and &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;allow you access.*
[OUTLAW] *Say that divine salvation looks an awful lot like prison to you.*
In that case it&apos;s high time we return to the order of the day! Which in my case is still the domain of dreams of course.
*Assure her that in your hands, her arrows will point only at the greatest of evils.*
So, this is your place, Braccus?
clouds.
*Tell her you don&apos;t want to lose her, but it&apos;s hard to ignore the admonition of a god.*
Hmm. Who am I to argue with such a fine sum? Go on your way, but try not to make any more trouble.
*Your efforts draw an expression of eerie calm. She stares up at you, wide-eyed...*
These pages relate how to enchant arrows with Source orbs. You  make a mental note that if blessing is possible, then surely so is cursing...

My friend, the very best lovers are, whisper it... &lt;i&gt;lizards. &lt;/i&gt;And for a barely significant sum of gold, I can introduce you to the greatest lizard lover the world has ever seen. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])

Hold on.
Nice to&apos;ve met you too.
I begged them to let me serve here on the island, to pay penance... they should have cast me into the sea instead - the Sallow Man proved I am still weak at heart.
Am I not? How many others have survived the Magisters&apos; witch hunt?
I am not here without your help. I do not forget this. For you - a prize. I save it for a special occasion, but... I can think of no finer occasion than this.
