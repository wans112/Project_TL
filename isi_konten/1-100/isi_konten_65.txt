*He pulls out a blank sheet of paper, picks up pen, and begins to write.*
*Close your eyes and smile. How satisfying when the pieces of the puzzle come together.*
I&apos;m Han. So, Fane. You helped me out just there, so let me return the favour. You want to get out of here?
*The Cathedral? Ask why Kemm would go to the Cathedral.*
You dare speak to me of hiding? You dare speak to me of &lt;i&gt;patience?&lt;/i&gt;
*Try talking to it.*
*Raise an eyebrow and ask if that means he&apos;s going to kill &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; now.*
This only delays the inevitable. He will return. And so will I.
I should have known something was up... he never brought &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; there, but he&apos;d always come back stinking to high heaven of chemicals.
*Look her in the eyes, smile, and say don&apos;t fear her: you desire her.*
Source Aerotheurge Skillbook
Skull Amulet
You have helped me to escape immediate danger, but I remain a fugitive from my old life, and... the promises I made to it...
*Tell him to get a job.*
*Ask what you won&apos;t take off it.*
Difficulty Change
*Tell her the Shadow Prince convinced you the return of dragons will doom the lizards. They must be destroyed. There is no other way.*
No disrespect, ey! I&apos;m used t&apos;callin&apos; all the Divine&apos;s offspring that way. Absent though our father may be...
Forgive me if I&apos;m not throwin&apos; confetti around. I&apos;ve left the kingdom without a queen. Are they... really better off than before? *Sigh* Maybe she was right. My blood is hot. I don&apos;t think this shite through.
Look around you. You&apos;ll find fear, and longing, and desperation. What good is a bard&apos;s solemnity in a city besieged by Void and divided by war?
Regardless, the world is filled with absolutely incredible sights, and who better to catalogue them with the awe they deserve than someone seeing them for the first time?
*A sudden shudder jolts through his body so violently that he drops to his knees, stunned into silence.*
Dungeon - Prison Cells A
*She smiles and strokes your cheek.*
Gotta get moving, never know when more o&apos; those Whites might pop out.
Once you&apos;ve helped Mihaly and I pass freely, once we&apos;re truly clear, I&apos;ll give you what you want...
There... may be an accident or two along the way. Can&apos;t be helped, I&apos;m afraid.
*Tell the cub you&apos;ve seen a bear. Point towards where you saw it.*
You have returned here too early, dear Fane. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
*The skeleton turns and spits - producing a glob of dust that wafts slowly to the ground.*
You are welcome here. Browse for as long as you need.
Noxious fumes come from these vents.
A Sourcerer lies murdered. The Magisters will pay for a lead on the killer.
One o&apos; those, are you? An aristocrat? A slaver even, from the House of War? Yeah, I think I pegged you right!
You tried your best, Han. I&apos;m... I&apos;m glad you&apos;re safe now.
May the soil under your feeeeeet stay ever sssssssssssssss...
Warm Sadha&apos;s egg.
*He works the damaged rapier, trying to straighten the blade.*
Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit Drudanae.
*The proprietress gives you her trademark sweet smile - only this time with a hint of regret.*
You win some you lose some. Though truth be told, you were the first opponent ever to acquaint me with defeat.
And I thought this cave couldn&apos;t get any more grim...
Crocodile Talk
*Like hell. Ask Ifan if he remembers the ordeals you went through in Fort Joy.*
*Nod in agreement. Very well, but you&apos;re still curious about this goddess of hers.*
*Announce in a firm tone that it&apos;s your turn to play with the gem.*
Lizard&apos;s Cleaver
Don&apos;t know about you, but I&apos;m good and ready to get gone.
*She searches your face for treachery. Doesn&apos;t seem to find it.*
Skill Schools
Cursed Ice
Goblin Mace
*Ask about him.*
Ah, you know how it is. Pretend you own the place and a surprisingly large number of people just... go along with it. But I won&apos;t lie, the beard &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;go down well with the ladies.
*Say you pulse with power, and you can&apos;t wait to put it to good use.*
I cannot be paid off!
All names! All! Do you not...? Do you not remember, Sebille?
Atta kid. I&apos;d let your guy go, but &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s got hold of my key. Until I find who it was and string &apos;im up, you&apos;ll have to undo the lock yourself. My fellas won&apos;t stop you.
*Even through her mask, you can feel her suspicious eyes on you.*
Just like that? You think you know someone!
Stu
*Knights of Drey? Ask who he means.*
*The intensity of her embrace deepens. Never since the unremembered days of childhood have you been so enveloped in maternal safety.*
*Wonder if he&apos;d really kill a man over a few pieces of fruit.*
*Take your leave.*
I must say - I&apos;ve never heard so many pet names for dead wood before.
Small Fire Beetle
Well, look at that. The Silver Claw is back.
Used Memory
We took the Source in the Soul Jar for ourselves and sent Withermoore&apos;s soul to its doom.
Writ of Passage
I&apos;ll teach you to take what isn&apos;t yours!
You okay, chief? Did the big mean tart insult your sensibilities?
The Whites were pulling a lot of strings in Arx, I see.
[1] gives you [2] to Constitution and +[3] to Strength.
*Note the lingering traces of blood on his hands and ask just what is preoccupying him.*
*Ifan chuckles to himself, yet you can feel his eyes watching you for a reaction.*
So the portal-master is dead. She&apos;ll do no more damage now. You have our thanks.
*Tell him you&apos;re a Sourcerer, but the Order is wrong about you. You &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; talk with whoever is in charge...*
Big Chest
We allied ourselves to the Sallow Man. We should no longer be bothered by he or his forces.
Come now, did you really think a handful of linen towels can fool me?
*The sword does not budge.*
It&apos;s a fun toy! I guess... I guess not. &apos;kay, I see your point. *Sigh.*
*Ask the rat if it wouldn&apos;t prefer to hang around somewhere else.*
As you wish.
Slug
We tried to ask Ryker about his unwanted &apos;promise&apos;, but he dodged the question.
I did not present myself to him. I was &lt;i&gt;chosen. &lt;/i&gt;
*Do as she asks.*
Lord Kemm approaches!
*Say: &apos;Second.&apos;*
I had hoped that after all this time you&apos;d have bought it from &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, the prince who&apos;s stood by you against your captor.
She was a scientist of sorts, or so the town criers chanted. She knew of the ways of nature and beyond, and I invited her to court to show me.
I distributed the Source of the world to all its inhabitants.
I saw that. Keep your hands where I can see them!
A medium-sized protective potion that can fortify you against geomantic attacks.
[1]HP
*Say you met a dog called Emmie, but she has passed on now.*
[VILLAIN] *Lips twitching, drink in the Magister&apos;s terror and advance.*
I suppose that&apos;s about the long and short of it.
This mask is the last vestige of humanity that remains. The only thing that renders me fair to my people...
&lt;b&gt;You...? You are old and tainted. There is no sport for us in corrupting you. The girl is pure. She is a delicacy&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
*State the password: &lt;i&gt;Fortitude.*&lt;/i&gt;
Alexandar&apos;s Severed Head
*Apologise for your somewhat brusque enthusiasm.*
*The squirrel clearly doesn&apos;t understand sarcasm, and continues his lively story.*
*She exhales loudly - a scoff if ever you&apos;ve heard one - and shuts her eyes. She nudges you away with the back of her hand.*
[SCHOLAR] *Shake your head. Her carelessness cost lives!*
This finely-wrought elven bow thrums with esoteric energy. Hit a target with one true shot and they will become flimsy as a paper puppet dancing on the wind.
*He passes his gaze over the young man&apos;s remaining family, then to a corpse bleeding out nearby. A child&apos;s corpse.*
*He looks out over the water once more, and so do you. A few tranquil moments pass as the waves lap against your thoughts.*
No! He is here... &lt;i&gt;he has come for me... &lt;/i&gt;
Character is weak.
The master&apos;s purpose is his own to speak, not mine.
Choose target to teleport.
I&apos;ve heard of someone like you lurking about, getting into trouble.
Farhangite Seedling
Has she once shown that she deserves our pity? It&apos;s all just a trick, just like before.
Oh hullo there. A fine day it is. And the finest day for a wee saunter through the trees it is too. Not even any Voidwoken left to spoil it!
Oh gracious, &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;... I truly hope you are not in cahoots with that brazen peddler? Well - *sniff* - she&apos;s in the dining room.
*Say she must have you confused with someone else.*
I do believe this is still &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; room, don&apos;t you know.
Looks like a battle took place here. Seekers and Magisters united in death...
The God King...
*Wonder what help Gareth could bring them here.*
An absolutely &lt;i&gt;fair&lt;/i&gt; transaction, you must agree... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;.
You just made the wrong move!
Rotten Dismembered Corpse
Isbeil. The traitor! Where is she? &lt;i&gt;I will split her black skull in two.&lt;/i&gt;
Aha! Ahaha! That must be one of your creatures&apos; jokes, yes? Oh how quaint.
*As you open the book and scan the words before you, the faintest rumble seems to emit from the direction of the dragon figurehead...*
I will have your head, Seeker!
Thank you for rescuing me after they had already strung me up. After they had tortured me for days. After they-
Ah. You have meant so much. Too much. I may not be Divine, but I still resolved to serve the kingdom, serve my people. And I can&apos;t belong to you while I belong to them.
Flaming Doggy Dart
My wares are for all who need them.
Please.
All sounds mighty reprehensible to me, guv&apos;nor. Why on earth would I do such a thing?
[BARBARIAN] *Tell her you&apos;re from the wilds.*
Well that&apos;s all fine and dandy, &apos;cept that Murga&apos;s good &apos;n&apos; dead now. Time fer a new plan, wouldn&apos;t ya say?
Snow Foggy
I am almost whole again. You will not stop me. &lt;i&gt;Not now!&lt;/i&gt;
You were right not to have faith in her. A well-placed bet.
...Do not look at me like that. I said it was &lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt;, not easy. Now break into the Magister barracks and find that list! You no longer have the luxury of time.
Never learn, do ya, freshie? Four Monarchs beat &apos;em all. Come on now. It ain&apos;t that hard. So. Pay up, then.
We do my favourite thing in all the world: we sail! The Council of Seven awaits, lass. Though if we dally among the waves, you won&apos;t find me complainin&apos;.
Glad to have you back.
What is it? Do we do something wrong?
*The spirit taps his foot, arms crossed tight across his chest.*
This is the poor soul we saw snatched away from the beach!
&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am not a one-time thing!&lt;br&gt;
We spoke the activation word, causing the spore to explode.
*Take your leave.*
If you choose to leave the area after this message, you will not be able to return again. Your open quests will be closed and archived.
Please, kin, don&apos;t do this!
I&apos;m on good terms with the Divine Order. They know what my work entails... they&apos;ve even had use for me in the past. I have nothing to fear from them.
