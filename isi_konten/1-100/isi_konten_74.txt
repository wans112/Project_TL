*Ask the figure what it is you&apos;re feeling.*
I couldn&apos;t let him kill you. *Whispers...* That would be awful.
Magister Ranger
You seek to betray me. Well, there&apos;s a little certain something I do with traitors.
We all look the sa&apos;e to you, do we? One head&apos;s as good as another, is it? That&apos;s just lovely. Ho&apos;e you&apos;re asha&apos;ed of yourself.
*Draw your weapon. They&apos;d killed your kind - you&apos;d return the favour.*
Potions
*Clench your fists. She doesn&apos;t know who she&apos;s messing with.*
*Her face clouds over for a moment.*
So?
Well, I cannot just go giving &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; away, you know. But I am happy to sell you some, if you like.
My children... they deserved the chance...
Save the family.
Come on, Dallis. We need to go.
*Tell her you wish her luck in whatever she&apos;s after, but you aren&apos;t here to help her or her people.*
It took every last bit of magic I had gathered to bring him back. Then we ran. I just wanted to find a safe den where we could hide together, but...
Auto-Detect
*Nods hello.*
*Blood quickly soakes through the cloth. Magister Siwan&apos;s mouth opens and closes, her eyes wide in terror.*
Hide
What?! You just saved me, you cur!
*Though your spell tore through it like a spear through flesh, the thing smirks, its face darkened with pleasure.*
The bloody corpses at his feet suggest it may be wise to give the strange figure plenty of space.
I made myself clear before - you are forbidden to enter Lord Arhu&apos;s quarters. Please do not make me refuse you again.
Everyone needs help sometimes. Especially when bloomin&apos; Magisters are hunting you out with those dogs of theirs!
Ghost Painting
My tongue! It&apos;s speaking the language of the Eternals! I mean... it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;gibberish, but such beautifully phrased gibberish.
Source Crystal
Hothead
There must be some potion that can calm her...
Read the greasy scrap of paper.
*Who is it she needs protection from? The other king that was mentioned at the wagon?*
Silver Necklace
Thank you. That very first moment of darkness... I&apos;ve never been so scared ever since.
Suspect in Alexandar murder found dead in Driftwood!
Red Prince! You&apos;ve come not a moment too soon. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt; Even &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt;
By taking the life of he who directed their demise:
Physical Armour
*Dark mottling pulses just under the Watcher&apos;s skin, like living veins of the Void. She begins to hum something tuneless, the sound like a hive of the damned.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve got a recipe for the best apple pie she&apos;ll ever taste.*
Adrenaline Skillbook
She&apos;s right, too. He might&apos;ve stood up for &lt;i&gt;her, &lt;/i&gt;but she&apos;d stood up for &lt;i&gt;everybody. &lt;/i&gt;It&apos;s the true measure of a heart - not how you treat those closest to you, but those you&apos;ve never even met. His heart was big. Hers was bigger.
*Tell him to go to hell.*
Intelligent and curious, your appetite for learning far exceeds your taste for bloodshed. Books and scrolls are your dearest possessions.
*Tell him that you liberated a note from the tavern cook&apos;s pocket - its contents are rather incriminating...*
Shoes of Superstition
*Demand to know why he attacked you.*
Please wait until system storage sync is complete.
*Remind him that a generous spirit is what separates a man from the animals.*
Death Electrified
Red Alert
*She throws up a salute and laughs low, but worry sparkles behind her eyes. She walks toward the mysterious figure, who turns toward her with narrowed eyes.*
She is always a warm sight in weary times.
*Tell Braccus to SHUT HIS GODSDAMNED MOUTH.*
Sunflower Ring
My love! My &lt;i&gt;prrrrince! &lt;/i&gt;There is much to prepare for our nuptials, and word still has to be spread throughout the land - be on your way!
Fane&apos;s Mask of the Shapeshifter
Lizard&apos;s Staff
Maybe that disemodied voice will save us from this place, too.
Someone called &apos;R&apos; will pay cash for the head of a Godwoken. The heads are to be taken to a certain sawmill.
*Tell him you&apos;re going to need details. What kind of stuff does he mean?*
*Show him where the spirit of Taryan may be found. Give him the belief that he is free to go.*
A promise you&apos;d best fulfil.
*The spirit pivots, sensing another assailant. He draws a fist back again - and suddenly freezes, his back arching in silent agony.*
We fought the pigs&apos; warder.
Away with you! I have no time for artless philistines!
Braccus left many restless souls here. He twisted this land into what you see today.
Ain&apos;t been here long, have you? *Ahem* No-one gets to have it all. No-one starves anyone else.
*Tell the dwarf to see sense - if their cove is compromised, Driftwood won&apos;t be any safer.*
*Kemm looms over Windego, a behemoth in contrast to her pathetic frame.*
I knew Isbeil&apos;s heart were filled with darkness. Didn&apos;t know she&apos;d fallen in with the God King himself, though. This isn&apos;t good...
This horrifying brew reeks of farmyard and abattoir, a disturbing bovine mix.
*Urge him to listen more closely: A&lt;i&gt;-lly, &lt;/i&gt;A&lt;i&gt;-lly, &lt;/i&gt;A&lt;i&gt;-lly.&lt;/i&gt; The heartbeat is saying you&apos;re an ally.*
*Tell Ifan you&apos;re a bit lost; what does he think you should do now?*
...
A raid on an ancient vault ended badly for the thief who&apos;d planned it. Perhaps we might succeed where they failed.
I&apos;m sorry, Simone... may you find rest...
*Say the highest quality vanilla essence.*
*Fury twists her face - she looks haunted, ready to fight or flee.*
*The executioner slides his finger along the shivering woman&apos;s cheek.*
How dreadfully crowded these rooms have become. One so yearns for the calm of earlier days.
*He smiles and stands there for a moment, holding onto you.*
*Say you never knew a Helene but that you&apos;re sorry to hear of her passing.*
Best leave that secret for someone who needs it - you can stroll out of here whenever you like...
*Tell her to direct them to an era of glory: of dragons and demons and worlds yet unconquered.*
Hiking Boots
There&apos;s no need for a long trial. He was seen with the effects of one of our company, it&apos;s more than enough evidence of crime.
*Grin mischievously and ask what he&apos;s afraid of. Whisper it in your ear - no-one will ever know.*
Map
*Decline; you want to keep your wits about you for the moment.*
*Ifan curls his lip in greeting, a knowing smile on his face.*
Item Description
Martha&apos;s axe looks... serviceable.
No. The die is cast. My promises cannot be made anew.
*Say there was a moment where you thought she wasn&apos;t going to go through with it.*
[LOHSE] *Sigh happily. Tell him it&apos;s good to meet a soul more twisted than you.*
Shadow to shadow...
Lone Wolf Mark
Protect these poor souls in their time of need.
Kinda reminds you of me, right? I thought so too.
Embassy Letter
Fine by me.
Elmwood Bow
...don&apos;t hurt me... don&apos;t hurt me... don&apos;t hurt me...
Let your blood quench our roots, so we may grow!
A hidden cache of a decidedly druidic nature.
I... appreciate this.
*Bow deeply and welcome &apos;the Matron&apos; to your humble office.*
The Bark&apos;s Bite
*Ifan frowns. His narrowed eyes have lost any playful twinkle you saw in them before.*
Test PVP User NPC
With pleasure.
Oh my! The purveyor of truth is slinging morals left and right like he&apos;s already been named Divine, while practically handing the Hammer a sure victory over Rivellon.
There were always rumours about The Hammer. Dallis, that is. What she was doing with the prisoners she hauled off to her fortress... why they never joined the rank-and-file thereafter...
[DWARF] *Inform her it isn&apos;t your size, but the depths of your bloodlust, that counts in battle.*
So I decided to surprise all the noble farts at dinner. Snuck into the kitchen. They had a giant boar on a platter with an apple in its mouth. Longer&apos;n Lora herself, and not much fatter, either. The cook put the lid on and set it down for the steward to take...
*This statue of Amadia seems ancient. Moss blooms from cracks all over the stone, and tears of rain stream from her eyes. A hollow space marks the centre of her creased brow.*
Start Level
Explore the Nameless Isle.
I don&apos;t know what I expected when I set out for Reaper&apos;s Coast...
Squeeze spores to shoot acid, dealing [1] damage.
Anyway, there&apos;s no mess here. I&apos;d smell it if there was.
They comin&apos; for us, ya reckon?
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The Beast. Take him. The Beast. Take... take... the Beast...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Fane would never forget.
*Revive Sir Lora.*
The prince, right? Glad to see you made it.
The Black Ring were tormenting an Ancestor Tree.
Ha-ha! It&apos;s been too long, my dear.
Her people were severed in twain. No matter her visions, a dream of peace would never come true. I said it would be so.
Nice try Jimmy Suave, but you&apos;re not really my type.
Leather Cover
True finesse requires dedication however... &lt;i&gt;sacrifice&lt;/i&gt;. In order to receive my aid, some other area of study must suffer a little... your wits, I believe. Do you wish to proceed?
&apos;The Mortall Remain&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; of Dool the Dark Stranger. Po&lt;i&gt;ff&lt;/i&gt;ibly.&apos;
[NOBLE] *Tell the gem your nanny bored you senseless with riddles as a child - you don&apos;t know the answer, and you don&apos;t care.*
Key to Stern Room
*Tell them you&apos;ve bested a few Voidwoken in your day. You know it isn&apos;t always easy.*
Bewitched Moppet
*Lady Kemm maintains her composure. A vortex of emotion runs deep beneath, but the surface is entirely still.*
Ivor, the Vast One
Then some stranger tried taking ol&apos; Lohar down but got himself caught and tied up. Ain&apos;t no coincidence Mordus weren&apos;t hangin&apos; around then.
[IFAN] *Ask him if that&apos;s what he told Lucian too.*
*Rush to explain. It wasn&apos;t you, it was the &lt;i&gt;thing.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you might be, though after discovering the mangled corpse of a certain Magilla, you&apos;re not so sure.*
And for what? To make the world a better place...? &lt;i&gt;LOOK AROUND.&lt;/i&gt;
*Lohse reaches out and twists the candles&apos; wicks. They smoke and die.*
*Wonder why she&apos;s not in the Hall of Echoes. She knows she&apos;s dead, right?*
*Still warm from the first glass, the second seems all the more attractive. You gulp it down.*
Dallis&apos; Diary
*With a new confidence in his stance, he gives you a casual salute, then turns back to his fishing.*
*The Magister looks at you for a long, hard moment. He seems angry, puzzled, and amused in equal measure.*
Surely not. What&apos;s your moral principle compared to the fate of all the realm, after all?
Game Master:
Craven wretch! Do your duty and return the jars to me!
Erm. Sure. I... yeah, go ahead.
She should be traipsing to safety as we speak!
&lt;i&gt;*Beeeeuuuwww. &lt;/i&gt;GOOD NIGHT, PAPA.*
The final god fell. With the island collapsing, Malady and the Lady Vengeance came to the rescue.
Those bloody Whites couldn&apos;t stand out more if they tried... but where are they?
I feel better already! Need to fatten meself up again so I don&apos;t lose it a second time. Can&apos;t be relying on the kindness of strangers to dig me out! The very best to ya, I wish you well.
We gave them up freely to create the first Divine. Each of us donated half of that which makes us gods. To bathe in the lake is to become our chosen.
We defeated the denizens of Horrorsleep. Sadha, the Red Princess, was amongst the dead.
*Stay silent. You know this moment means a great deal to the Red Prince.*
So. &lt;i&gt;See me run, I never walk. I have a mouth, I never talk. I have a bed, I never sleep. I can be shallow, I can be deep.&lt;/i&gt;
More likely than you think, even for one as blindingly colourful as you. But it means keeping your pride in check.
