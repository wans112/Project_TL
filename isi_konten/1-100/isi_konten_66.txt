*Warn him to watch his mouth.*
Find Ryker.

The Divine held her ground, if barely.
*She kisses your neck, your chest; twirls her tongue around your nipples.*
...the doctor makes no deals...
*Hook the robe with a claw and throw it in the air, allowing it to swirl, then in a single fluid movement catch it, fold it over one arm, and present it to him.*
*Sparks fly and metal plates buckle. With a deafening hiss, the valve breaks free of the pipe and the faint stream of fog spurts and sputters, threatening to flood the room.*
&lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;Lohse?! At &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;home tavern?
*Her hands clasped together, the spirit of a woman mumbles silent prayers to herself...*
I have told you before. The Void is stronger than ever. But so are you.

Better not touch this.
You are late. Your comrade already attempts to earn their place.
Bearing Sword
No deal. I&apos;m worth more than you can afford.
No discounts! No refunds! One-way ticket only! Come back when you&apos;re worth my time, weary traveller! Beg, borrow or steal what you need, for this is the trip of a lifetime!
*Push back. Don&apos;t let Sallow into your head.*
As you wish, mistress Almira...
Musician, are you? Well, you and I might be good friends. Nothing sets my heart a-stir like the sound of something beautiful rolling over the waves, over the night...
*Frown and demand to know who he is.*
Heathen&apos;s Curse
Come to me. Let us barter.
*Tell it you won&apos;t take its gibberish for an answer. Cry out its name: Xhaxh!*
Leave me to work in peace!
We learned that demons are bound tightly to those they possess, and often react poorly to when their host&apos;s body is threatened. If we wish to purge a demon from someone, then perhaps we will need to learn more about its traits and weaknesses.
Unusual Platemail Greaves
Rejoice, kin. The Mother is gone. Saheila says we are free.
We intervened in the execution. There was violence.
*Lohse looks to you one last time.*
Replica of The Third Passion Of Lucian
I told you to clear off away from my gear. You got a deathwish?
*You nod. And that&apos;s where the Seeker Gareth went?*
Maybe you&apos;ll get to meet all of them on your travels! If you &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;see them...
Let&apos;s find out.
We refused to help Ryker with his request.
&apos;A Pauper Lieth Here,&lt;br&gt;Sicke and Dying He was Founde,&lt;br&gt;We did Give Hym Blankets,&lt;br&gt;In them He Dyed.&lt;br&gt;In them He is Interred.&apos;
Learn more about Migo.
And yes, he killed the others. He stole their knowledge, then he stole their lives, and then he stole their Source.
*Take your leave. *
My powers are depleted, Godwoken. Would that I could help you more, but alas...
*Her eyes suddenly flash a bright red.*
Your Reimond&apos;s merc, not mine. Ask &lt;i&gt;him &lt;/i&gt;for your pay, &apos;n see what he says.
It&apos;s for the best. If he&apos;s dangerous, it&apos;s better to take care of him now.
You have no more chances. Prepare yourself!
Select what language to use.
I can&apos;t tell you how grateful I am for your kindness. Now, I&apos;m just trying to get used to life as a pig. It&apos;s not so easy. I never did enjoy truffles.
I wouldn&apos;t have taken you for a ghoul, but sucking out a child&apos;s Source? That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;dark!&lt;/i&gt;
Each day may be the day that I will be finally punished.
My masterpiece! I swear I had it a moment ago.
I am whole. &lt;i&gt;We are One.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One thing I do know is the answer won&apos;t make you any happier. Let the bodies lie, justice for the dead belongs in the Hall of Echoes.

*The royal guards unsheathe their blades and point them not at Isbeil - but at you.*
If the correct ritual is performed, an elf who dies becomes an ancestor tree - their memories preserved in the roots.
Bonnet

*There seemed to be something a little... odd in the chick&apos;s last little chirp. Looking closer, you see its eyes bulging like twin black marbles. Something is decidedly not right here, &lt;i&gt;not right&lt;/i&gt; at all...*
He transmogrified me and all my servants into the beasts you see before you. I will not yield though! I remain royalty, right to my very core!
*Say you&apos;re surprised. How can the demon inside you be the same demon he hunts elsewhere?*
Leave me, please. Today has been hard.
Lucian, hear my prayer...
Let me work on him. I&apos;ve got questions that need answers, answers I can &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; get from him.
Restores [1] per turn.
Sir Gareth thanked the surviving Seekers for their service, and gave them their freedom. Disillusioned with ongoing war, he set out alone to find a new purpose. He would never stop seeking.
*So she&apos;s implying you must steal the powers of the other gods? That makes you feel rather uncomfortable.*
*End the song with a verse about how the two friends each rowed across the sea to see the other, passing each other without realising it.*
Don&apos;t expect a welcome.
No... no!
*Ask why his coat hasn&apos;t decomposed.*
Thank you, I appreciate the spell. Here&apos;s hoping...
Slay Hannag.
Still strollin around, are ya? Guess you haven&apos;t met Griff yet.
*Talk about the wedding, and the Voidwoken attack there.*
*Say these eggs should be destroyed! They&apos;re a danger to this world!*
Names have power. I don&apos;t think anybody knows his name. He&apos;s the strongest among us. Rose from the Deathfog to lead us to redemption.
*Through his visor you can only see his eyes, but there&apos;s something in them that belies the steely exterior.*
I &lt;i&gt;am &lt;/i&gt;preparing. Gotta be calm if I wanna storm the Joy, don&apos;t I. Hah.
*Clap him on the back and say you agree.*
Alexandar, you&apos;re dead! Haha!
Tch tch tch tch!
Get out of here!
There you are. Buggies didn&apos;t get the better of you then, eh?
SURPRI-ISE! We could have. But a few of us made it out, in any case. One of those kids, too - told us a-l-l-l-l about it. But don&apos;t worry. Manslaughter happens.
Player left!
&lt;i&gt;The Divine does not absolve a traitor of his grace...&lt;/i&gt;
Duna is at your side. I will pray for you.
*Recall a story of a brave prince marrying a princess and slaying her greedy old father to become king.*
Please...
*Justinia takes you in. She sees your resentment, and your pain. She sees your confidence, and your confusion. She sees Marcus - and she sees the Beast. Her breathing slows and her eyes soften. She speaks as both queen and cousin.*
*Smile, avoiding challenging his extravagant claim.*
Defence
*You&apos;ve heard that term before. Ask what exactly he means by &apos;Godwoken&apos;.*
Red Prince, you are greater than all others, for you are the sum of all others. You are the ur-father; the life-shaper made manifest in a man.
I believe in you.
Skull
*Point towards the forest. Tell them you saw a cat. It was blind. And tied up. If they run, they&apos;ll catch it. You&apos;ll mind the gem &apos;til they get back.*
General
I understand their reasoning, but you can&apos;t let innocents suffer like that.
*She looks you over in silent contemplation, her eyes a-sparkle with a hint of glee.*
*Ifan approaches you, a drink in his hand and a wide smile on his face. He clearly feels at home in this grimy place.*
*Shrug. You just can&apos;t make yourself care about any of this.*
I won&apos;t be able to breathe easy until that island disappears over the horizon.
Beryl Griff was displeased to hear that Sister Schori had been killed.
Same old story. The Queen is trying to quench the rebellion but the rebels are too quick for her. And in all that, the traders are getting more powerful while the nobility weakens. What part they&apos;ll play in the upcoming war remains to be seen.
*Ask if Griff won&apos;t be angry to see her selling to one of your kind.*
Amyro told us that the blind seer Saheila is crucial to the survival of the elves.
Yeah, so that lady, we kicked her out. And while you might think the key phrase in that sentence is &apos;kicked her out&apos;, it&apos;s actually &apos;that lady&apos;.
Blood Dowry
Go now! I expect the most eligible kings and suitors to be petitioning for my hand in marriage as soon as possible!
How&apos;n the hell did you do that?
*She goes quite pale and swallows hard as her hands involuntary reach for her throat.*

*Tell her to go right ahead.*
*Demand to know what&apos;s in it for you, if you help her.*
Thanks, I feel a lot better! You know, the other injured here could use your help too. Simone means well... but she&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;cook&lt;/i&gt;. Her kind of healing&apos;s more suited to a steak than a man.
A glowing wand wreathed in phantom flame; it rests warm in your hand, as if its core were made of glowing coals.

No, wait - !

Ah. A creepy ruin. What could go wrong?
The Meistr can tell us how to proceed on our quest. Malady will try to help us - but only if all else fails.

First time I spoke, Momma ran through the streets cryin&apos; &apos;demon!&apos; Poor thing, shook her to the core.
Rogue
Heavy-Duty Boots
Paladins and Magisters lying dead in the street. Wherever they&apos;re hiding, the Black Ring must love this.
*The gargoyle taps one stony claw upon its plinth as it rasps a message to you.*
*&apos;Here lies Natalie Bromhead. In death she may find the peace that was denied to her in life.&apos;*
Looking for something else?
Suit yourself.
Yeh see the nose on my face, don&apos;t you? I bloody know it smells, and I don&apos;t care as long as it sells! And sells it does. Somehow...
