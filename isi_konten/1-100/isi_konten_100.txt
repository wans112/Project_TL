A wise choice. My knowledge is yours, Godwoken. Go and make use of it.
No! How... how did you get here?
*Ask what they seem so happy about.*
*Tell them that if they don&apos;t give you the gem, you&apos;ll kick the shite out of them.*
*Trying not to gape at his ugly wound, offer Han one of your healing potions.*
*As he regains consciousness, Tir-Cendelius frees an arm from the tendrils that bind him. He clutches at the coils but cannot rend them apart.*
*Your arms rest on her shoulders, squeezing her tight and for a moment - just a moment - you feel whole again.*
This is a unique opportunity. The impossible is now possible. Kill her. Free us from her tyranny. Please...
*Boast that you are willing to take on any challenge that she has to offer.*
The servants, they got nothing up there. Ryker has it all now. They need to be freed. Only way: Kill Ryker.
Hello, beautiful. I was wondering when you were going to arrive.
We&apos;ve walked into enough traps today - we should take it slowly.
Mmm...
*Hesitate. This is all going rather quickly.*
Try using &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;water&lt;/font&gt; to clear fire surfaces. Using a water spell or destroying a water barrel should extinguish the fire.
*Now you need a new champion, one that will set the world ablaze.*
They might not be as comfortable as house slippers, but if you step on a nail? You won&apos;t even notice.
[RED PRINCE] *Muse you had a family too: a whole House in fact. They didn&apos;t stand by you. They exiled you.*
*So what comes next? Ask how you become Divine.*
You have my thanks. And please, report to Magister Carver at the barracks. He&apos;ll want to thank you himself for what you&apos;ve done.
... in the latter half of the century, we have seen scientists striving to recreate the horrors of Deathfog in weaponised form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No instance of this is more well-known than the Divine Order&apos;s use of the poisoner Farzanah to create massive quantities of Deathfog. They used Farzanah&apos;s handiwork in their offensive against the Black Ring during the Great War, an offensive which not only destroyed the Black Ring, but decimated the elves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is clear that the potential for use of Deathfog in war is great indeed. Great and terrible. Yet, who has the right to determine when it can be used. Previously, the Divine took it upon himself. But the Divine is dead...
I have seen well over two thousand springs, and will continue to do so until time itself closes its weary eyes.
&lt;i&gt;This is not the time for talk, Ifan. Kill him - &lt;b&gt;now!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
A Letter from R.
*Ask if he&apos;s looking for anything in particular, or just browsing the... wares.*
Bet you and the Empress would have gotten along great. Too vicious to care about anyone else. Good riddance!
I&apos;ve seen a few traders about the place.
The Wyre
*Ask why he and the other Seven gods have left Rivellon godless.*
So was it really of &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; that the dream voices spoke?
Grruuugh!
*You&apos;ve seen enough. Pull yourself from the spirit&apos;s visions.*
Oh, dear. Tut-tut. You want me to hurt you. You want me to take your soul for my own. Together we could have been... Divine. But instead...
*Ask him who - or what - can teach you what you need to learn.*
My, aren&apos;t we squeamish!
*She nods her thanks - and immediately winces, laying her hand on the back of her neck.*
Dirty and partially burned note.
*Say you don&apos;t know the password.*
Watch out! She&apos;s dying, but she&apos;s opening a portal as she goes!
Energy Chest
You were on that luckless lot of timber that met with one tentacle too many, weren&apos;t you?
*Say you have, and you still have no desire to act as her pawn.*
Hmm. Yes. That sounds... troublesome.
I thought I saw you hurting someone. Was... was it really you?
In the next world, I fear. Gareth met his end north of here, at the ruins which guard Braccus&apos;s armoury.
Certainly, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; cannot ascend. You are not ready.
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;. The so-called &apos;predator&apos;. I&apos;d be wining and dining aboard the Lord Dread if it weren&apos;t for you. Your meddling in Magister affairs had better be worth it!
Well, have you read it yet? What&apos;s the password?
One, two, long dead are the crew... three, four, pretty shells on the shore...
Your level defines how far your character has advanced.
Every step of the way I&apos;ve wanted you. Since the moment we met. I&apos;ve tried to conceal it, but... I can hardly &lt;i&gt;breathe&lt;/i&gt; around you.
Did you think I wouldn&apos;t notice that? You better watch it.
Attack_Skill_Prep_1
I don&apos;t mean I would realllly eat him, of courrse. I&apos;m not a snaaaaapping turtle.
But...
We&apos;re nearly there - don&apos;t stop now!
*Say &apos;true&apos;.*
Are you a Sourcerer? One of those guys that brings the bad Void things here?
*He lifts the corpse&apos;s eyelids, peering underneath.*
P-please - just let me go. I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;ll put the armour back, I -
*A curt nod and she&apos;s gone forever.*
Feel free to look about while I catch my breath.
*Ask what she means by &apos;Shriekers&apos;?*
More Voidwoken? This day just gets better and better...
My... my strength is returning... I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll be able to fight again soon...
Poison Cloud Grenade
*Tell her you&apos;ll always back a warrior who wishes to fight.*
*Swaying lightly from side to side, the Silent Watcher maintains their ceaseless vigil.*
The Brute
How... how do I move on?
But perhaps it is all for nothing.
We gave Garvan his supplies.
Ngh... hmm? No, no, no...
*She lets out a guttural howl - a noise like you&apos;ve never heard, and throws back her head. When she runs out of breath, she gasps loudly and howls again. Again. Again.*
Please! Please... could you help me?
*Report that you killed Mordus. Show Lohar his amulet as proof.*
Oh-hoho, be careful what you wish for, fellow-me-lad! You may well get your hands on them &lt;i&gt;contraptions&lt;/i&gt; as you call them. Sooner, perhaps, than you&apos;d&apos;ve liked...
*Before you go, ask if he&apos;d like to join your team. Maybe he&apos;s good for &lt;i&gt;something.*&lt;/i&gt;
But the reason I was purged was slightly less... intellectual.
Only she knows if she atones for her sins.
RAAAGH!
Right Shift
*Ask if you can take her invitation, if she no longer needs it.*
Right. Well. Good luck with that. *Sips.* Say, if it&apos;s not too small a matter, O Divine One, perhaps you&apos;d help us settle an argument before you ascend?
*Whine*
No history of the Great War between the Divine Order and the Black Ring would be complete without mentioning the collateral damage suffered by the elves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the livewood trees chopped down to make Order ships, to the indentured use of elves to feed upon and learn the secrets of the silent dead, the elves were the true victims of the carnage that ripped Rivellon apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And at the very end of the Great War, even the last blow that put an end to the Black Ring, was the Deathfog that decimated the homeland of the elves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Small wonder that some of them bear a grudge against humans. Small wonder, at all.
You &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; be serious. Do you know what I... &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; can accomplish with this sword made whole?
I already told Callo to send you here from Driftwood. Not to mention the little fact that I am &lt;i&gt;the leader of a band of assassins&lt;/i&gt;. Come on!
Browse
[MYSTIC] *Say that Seven themselves would have fled from the place where he practiced his horrors.*
Heeheehee. That&apos;s silly. &apos;cos if you chop it up and roll it in salt it&apos;ll last for ages.
*This is the heart of the Mother Tree, the centre of the elven universe. It looks... &lt;i&gt;unwell.*&lt;/i&gt;
Then I recommend you stay out of Arx.
*Cough politely.*
It&apos;s not about appeasement. It&apos;s about answers. You&apos;ve killed hundred, maybe thousands. And for what - a few Magisters &apos;n&apos; Paladins threatenin&apos; to look at ya funny?
*The boy stares fixedly at the dirt floor, twitching lips giving away the grimace he&apos;s trying to hide as stinking ointment is applied to a deep gash on his leg.*
Seems to me like you&apos;d go in there and rile that demon up. You just move along, and let the professionals handle this.
Why... a &lt;i&gt;grown &lt;/i&gt;friend? You&apos;ve brought an adult here? Good... good gods! Can it be...?
*Say that you solved the case and collected the reward from the Magisters.*
*Place the Shadow Prince&apos;s Deathfog device onto the pulsating organ.*
We made it through the maze.
*You chew it for what seems like forever, yet the texture does not change in your mouth. Tough, yet moist; leathery, yet slippery. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;disgusting.*&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, love, I&apos;m wrecked... Can&apos;t go. Couldn&apos;t move my feet. As likely to stab you in the neck as shake your hand.
Mind you, it&apos;ll be a damn sight easier when we&apos;ve weapons that can take on them Shriekers. The Magisters&apos;ll tear us to pieces otherwise!
Please, leave me be. Today&apos;s - well, it&apos;s been tougher than most.
But who am I to judge, eh? Why, I&apos;m just happy to see a friendly face after being the Hammer&apos;s captive here for &lt;i&gt;so long&lt;/i&gt;...
Come on. Let&apos;s keep moving.
[PETPAL] *Sigh. You can speak the languages of every animal you meet, but not one masked weirdo...*
Brahmos the Wanderer awaits me &apos;in the mists beneath the hamlet of Driftwood&apos;. Where could that be?
*State that it doesn&apos;t matter - the cook will be dealt with. He should let matters rest now.*
*With the barest blink, Tovah accepts your good wishes, then turns back to the corpse.*
Best let me rest as well - dead, or so it seems: dead but not entombed.
Because you refused a direct order! You broke your oath. The penalty is death.
Right. Let&apos;s put it behind us.
*Again you feel the statue take you...*
[SEBILLE] *Say you&apos;re not just interested in killing him. You&apos;re interested in watching him suffer.*
What some intruding corpse thinks does not concern us: only that it has opened our door. And is standing in the way...
I didn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;keep&lt;/i&gt; him here. I didn&apos;t want any of this.
Easy, meatbag, or I&apos;ll root you to the ground and call a Voidwoken to show you the true meaning of terror. Muah-hah!
This ain&apos;t fair! LEMME OUT!
*You hear a quiet, hissing chuckle from the chest as you hop about holding your foot. It&apos;s tougher than it looks...*
*Ask about this Tovah.*
[1] reduces [2]AP from the cost of using Daggers and Knives.
*He sighs dramatically.*
*Fight against the urge to flee and introduce yourself.*
*Shake your head. There can be no mercy for one sworn to the God King. Not even her.*
*She keeps the pace, her eyes locked with yours, a half-drugged smile on her lips.*
*Say it&apos;s because Magisters hurt people - people like you.*
*Nod: you&apos;re afraid so.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve heard nothing of Gwydian Rince, but you have some questions of your own.*
*Choose heads.*
Any blessing from a stone idol is a hollow one.
*Assure them you have no interest in their &apos;secrets&apos;, but you&apos;d like to know why they&apos;re here.*
Don&apos;t listen to hi&apos;! He&apos;s crazy! He wants to die, he does! I&apos;d hel&apos; hi&apos; if I could, &apos;ut he&apos;ll kill us all! DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
*Ask the pig what happened to her.*
My sweet Stephyn,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I write this letter, we near the isle. By the time the owl delivers it, I will be but a day away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ve heeded Alexandar&apos;s orders, just as you said I should. But I think of Lucian often. Would the Divine have condoned this? Would he have blessed us as we ripped children from their mothers? Can this... be the only way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel cold. Inside and out. Of one thing I am certain: Your arms will warm me when I find you again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With love,&lt;br&gt;Ricks
