From the desk of Her Ladyship, Dallis, Right Hand to Bishop Alexandar, Son of the Divine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be no more excuses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How is it that you have not crushed this rebellion yet? For your own sakes, you&apos;d best find and dispose of the dregs of these &apos;Seekers&apos; before you meet the same end as Atusa. The Source King&apos;s weapons do us no good if the Seekers lay hands on them first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully, some of you remain useful. Ames has reported Seeker movement to the south and east of the bridge leading out of Fort Joy. Spear them, slice them, burn them, I don&apos;t care. But see that they are gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-D

*Say you&apos;ve met him, and he was none too friendly.*
Tsk tsk tsk. Such disrespect. I&apos;d be a bit friendlier if I were you. But, then again, I guess it doesn&apos;t really matter, does it? I&apos;m still going to destroy you.
I doubt it. There&apos;s no-one left who&apos;s free of sin.

I hope I can get more songs out of this lute. The magic won&apos;t last forever.

Once Gareth emerges from the keep there, he and I will join you directly. He may be interested in you. Me? Not so much.
What is that chest made of? I feel weakened just being near it...
Just so, and I am thrilled to say that you will not receive any help from me. Alas, you need someone of flesh and bone.
Let me do the talking here. This one&apos;s expecting me...
Be brave. For both of you.

Bit of a tricksy one, given how I was captured on duty and all. Sallow does not take kindly to failure. But he looooooooves me, so he does. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;darling.

1234 AD: The Appearance of the Voidwoken&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*In a small volume that seems to be more of a notebook of thoughts than a published tome, Huwbert wonders if the strange creatures that emerged from the Deathfog that destroyed the Black Ring - the monsters known at the time of writing as the Voidwoken - were not the real winners of the great war. The historian does not draw a conclusion.*
