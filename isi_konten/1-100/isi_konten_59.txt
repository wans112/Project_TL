The specifics are rather &lt;i&gt;involved&lt;/i&gt;... but just as Source can give life to puppets, so too can it grant wisdom to stone. The will of the statue is the will of the Divine, I can assure you.
*Smile and slink away. This could take a while.*
Thank you, thank you! You&apos;re so good - so kind - so brave!
*She shakes with rage.*
*Tell the ghost to toughen up. He should have saved himself.*
Ours. The dwarves are my people, and you are my champion.
Singed White Magister Meeting Notes
Lo - I am struck by stars once more!
Was it you who got her breathing again? That didn&apos;t take long.
Effie has sneaked a little something into this character&apos;s Drudanae.
Smelly Pants
Yes...
No surprise there. Jimmy&apos;ll sniff out a fresh corpse from a half-mile away, I swear it. Death&apos;s hardly a rarity in Arx of late, so the city&apos;s been a veritable feast.
Dead Explorer&apos;s Diary
Watch your step... I don&apos;t quite trust this place.
Screamer
[BARBARIAN] *Say you feel nothing but the hot blood in your veins.*
Hnngh...
Go hence, learn, and do not tarry. The Void grows stronger with every passing hour.
Blank Fire Skillbook
It won&apos;t respond to my touch...
Grrrrr...
Them lizard Dreamers. I tell ya, they give me nightmares!
*Inspect the device further. It&apos;s time to deal with the Deathfog, once and for all.*
Shiny!
Huh. Well, go on then. Probably doesn&apos;t matter who breaks her, so long as she gets broken.
Jump from one target to another, hitting up to [1] targets, dealing [2] to each. Targets are chosen randomly in a [3] radius.
Jade Amulet
Once, perhaps. Had you been earlier, you would have found a willing &apos;Master of Source&apos;, but no longer. The Magisters saw to that.
[VILLAIN] *Tell him that to do wrong is the only &apos;right&apos; we can know, for it is only in breaking the law that we can derive the most pleasure.*
Huh?
*Ask if he can remember his name, where he came from - anything.*
being teleported.
Probably for the best. And remember, this conversation never happened.
*Change the subject and ask what she has on offer.*
&lt;i&gt;The Doctor is dead... you must... pay!&lt;/i&gt;
Empty slot
Dorotya&apos;s Chest
When first I saw you pass the Shriekers, I thought perhaps the others had come to join us.
*A cruel smile spreads across her lips.*
You have my thanks, friend.
*Ask what they did in life.*
*Mutter that the Void would be too good for the lot of them.*
Meistr Siva was arrested by Magister forces. She is at a gallows on the outskirts of Driftwood.
Mirror to Sadha
Sebille... I was wondering when I&apos;d see you again. Knew the time would come after you broke daddy&apos;s leash.
Trader Vaila
*As your blood touches the deer&apos;s lips, its head lurches drives forward, clamping its mouth over the wound. You can feel half of your vitality slowly drain away.*
Did I stutter before, or are you just stupid? Either way, hands off!
All living creatures have their small share of Source. You may draw it to you, and I will show you how. You shall gain much in power. But they... *shrug*... they will lose it all. They die.
This... Isbeil woman. What&apos;s her deal?
Soul Mate Scroll
*You cover your face with your hands. You&apos;ve just heard the news: The elven homelands have been destroyed by Deathfog. It was your Order who did it. How can this be...?*
*Struggle against the current, try to swim to safety.*
*She scratches her head.*
*Run your fingers slowly down each rib and promise you&apos;ll be the most satisfying experiment he&apos;s ever run.*
Explode, dealing [1] in a large area around you, creating a Water surface.
*Say you understand and take your leave.*
TO ARMS! Kill this one!
*Tell her not to worry, you may have picked up some mortal traits in the world, but &apos;failure&apos; is still a foreign concept to you.*
Suppose it was. Did the job, anyway.
Have faith, my brother, have faith!
*You used Source to heal a sick child. The Magisters threw you in jail. Then, in the night, came the dwarves. They marched you blindfolded through the sewers, clapped you in irons, and took you apart for your Source.*
Food Trader
*Tell her she&apos;s going to have to elaborate.*
You returned to the world as the undead Godwoken who failed to become Divine.
*He sinks to his knees, otherworldly silver blood blossoming from a wound between his shoulder blades.*
It seems these weapons are from an ancient era - they date from long before even the time of Braccus Rex.
[FANE] *Observe that he is missing most of his body. It indicates poor judgement.*
*Malice.*
Embedded in the wall, missing an eye, was an ornate skull.
He waits and watches - but for what?
Commonly bestowed upon officers of the Divine Order, this multipurpose tool allows for advanced crafting.
They spewed some nonsense about Magisters collaborating with the Black Ring. They could at least be honest if they just wanted to seize power from us.
Double Buffering
Spirit of the Knight of Rhalic
Enter or exit sneak mode.
You failed me once. But I am not a fool, you juicy little morsel. I&apos;ve built up my hunger while you were gone, and they always say that hunger is the best sauce.
*Insist he genuflect. You weren&apos;t kidding.*
*You look into Red Prince&apos;s face. He eagerly searches your eyes for any hint of how you must feel now that it&apos;s over; now that the Master is dead.*
*The pond now shines with an inner light, and standing in its waters you feel rejuvenated; pure, as if born anew.*
*Ask him to be gentle.*
What do you want with me?!
Retribution
You will stand by my side at all times. You are my favourite. It will be a glorious world that we build together.
Large Resist All Potion
You&apos;re willing to risk Fort Joy for one night with a lizard?
*Ponder his words. What does &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; plan to do with this tablet?*
We stole the Source from Gratiana&apos;s Soul Jar.
Amazing. But not unexpected.
Bark At The Rune: Frost Rune
*Leave the spirit be.*
*Say you&apos;ll consider looking - if you find the time.*
*Jahan takes you by the arm; his voice a whisper.*
Brother Lyle
*Roar in anger. He knew the Peacemaker was to ship Deathfog &lt;i&gt;this whole time?*&lt;/i&gt;
Later.
It may just be you. The One. You might be her!
Nock. Focus. Aim. Repeat. And remember: repetition leads to mastery!
Still, it&apos;s good to be on the move again.
I want a statue. Something modest. A simple piece of marble and gold, on the steps of the Cathedral, glaring out over Arx...
There may be more I can do for you. Come find me if you are interested in growing the Source inside you. You may find that new strength will soon become essential.
Just remember what I said, Godwoken. If you die, then this was all for nothing.
People running. Elves. They&apos;re... it&apos;s the war! Deathfog in the forests!
No! Animal! Beast! Slug! Please - no!
[ELF-FRIEND] *Tell her that she can relax - you&apos;re not here to cause trouble. You&apos;re a friend of elves.*
...infatuation is but pointless jest!
Fine-grained wood lovingly cleaned and oiled, ready to be turned into a weapon of destruction. The artistic woodcarver within you laments.
*Say that they fell prey to The Blood That Walks.*
*Recognise the pain in her eyes and back off. Offer that you hope she&apos;ll see her family again.*
*Extortionate! You have no intention of paying that much to delve deeper into this flea-ridden flophouse.*
*He draws his weapon and scowls.*
You should&apos;ve just left us alone!
Not that it matters now - we explored as much of that vault as we could, and the weapons are on their way to the Lady Vengeance.
I heard old Alex died trying to summon a Voidwoken.
Each ally consumes oil surfaces around them, converting the oil surfaces to Physical Armour. Removes Slowed.
Let&apos;s see what we&apos;ve got here.
*Tell the Voidwoken it&apos;s wrong. The world does not belong to the Void, and never will.*
Funny fish they have around here. Let&apos;s filet them.
Then I met this band of merry weirdos and was cordially invited to get the hell out of Fort Joy seeing as I&apos;m... &lt;i&gt;we&apos;re&lt;/i&gt;... well, you know...
*You see two skeletons sitting at a table, cards in hand. They creak and turn to stare at you.*
I wish I had a fitting way to thank the person who saved my life. As it is all I can offer is... well, it&apos;s not much, but maybe you&apos;ll find some use for it. Thank you.
Right. Right.
Help Hannag.
More slaughter... killed by Voidwoken, who were killed in turn themselves...
*Ask no further questions.*
Scroll
These people deserved better than being stuck in Fort Joy in the name of the Divine.
Fire Ooze
Grog the troll is dead. Marg will be happy.
This is written in ancient lizard script. It appears to be a song...
Hm. You seem pretty well-adjusted.
Glowing Door
*The grief-stricken cub hurries off.*
*Decide that it&apos;s time for the Sallow Man to die.*
[JESTER] *Explode in laughter and point to her escaping prisoner. A drudanae-addicted troll would make a better warden than her.*
*Easier to wrench your own head from your shoulders. The helmet remains in place.*
*Tell him to stand down, you don&apos;t want trouble.*
*Tell him the last time you saw Delorus was on the Nameless Isle. And the last time you saw the Nameless Isle it had just... exploded.*
Now get your twisted mind out of my house, before I have the guards throw you into the canal.
Default Action, Accept
I have enough nitre and brimstone to turn this factory into a crater! Please, I don&apos;t want to die, but if the Magisters find me... *sobs* I won&apos;t let them take me! I &lt;i&gt;won&apos;t!&lt;/i&gt;
Hunter-dreamer
Lucian&apos;s right. We can save the world from the Void. We should make the sacrifice.
*Ask if she&apos;s sure she wasn&apos;t hallucinating. Perhaps whatever&apos;s in her head is playing mind games.*
Nether Swap Scroll
You understand me completely. With the needle I killed him, and with the needle I struck his name from my skin.
*Sanders? Remark that yes, you have met him.*
You have no collar!
*You step from your hiding-place as the mob goes racing by, crying &apos;thief&apos; and &apos;witch&apos; and &apos;hag&apos;. None but the younger men give you a second glance &lt;i&gt;(they &lt;/i&gt;give you a third glance, and a fourth).*
Halla the hero hid valuables in nearby farmland. We should check our map.
*Repeat yourself: What does he know about the supplies?*
Reset the gamma correction to its default value.
*Return his royal greeting, then inquire after his health as is the custom.*
Some folks - and some reptiles - would do &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;to get his attention.
Anvil
*The squirrel seems to be flicking through various scraps of paper, humming and hawing as he goes. After some time he throws the scraps to the wind and spurs on his cat.*
Whetstone
Search Ambience
&lt;br&gt;G O D W O K E N
*A calming cool travels from the trunk into your fingertips, up your arm, and throughout your entire body. For a moment, you feel totally relaxed.*
The elven tree must fall. The elven tree must fall! He fears it. He fears the elves.
That said, he did want to talk to me about Sadha: a chance I was deprived off when you so gracefully skewered his neck with your needle.
UI Scroll dialogue text down
If she weren&apos;t blindfolded, I might think she&apos;s keeping an eye on me.
