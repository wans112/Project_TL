We left the demon&apos;s home plane with our business unfinished. The demon will face Lohse at full strength.
I&apos;ll spare you the tall tales we usually tell.
Really? You think I&apos;m going to tell you? You figured you&apos;d just wander up here and ask nicely, or maybe use some hocus-pocus?
It&apos;s alright.
Dusty Hat
&lt;i&gt;Thank &lt;/i&gt;you.
We forced our way through the main gate of Fort Joy.
We walked your path once. You must discover it yourself, as we did.
You? &lt;i&gt;Again?&lt;/i&gt;
Welcome to Arx, stranger. Our apologies for the mess, we&apos;ll have it cleaned up directly. Try to be careful where you tread.
*Stare at her in surprise. She&apos;s... undead?*
You are undead, but strutting about Reaper&apos;s Coast without a care. Naturally, as you have a mask to hide your features - an item of prestige.
Higba deserved to die - he was a Sourcerer, just like any other. But perhaps you&apos;re on to something...
*Tell him he&apos;s dead. It&apos;s time to move on.*
*Promise the dwarf that you&apos;ll save him.*
Alright, boss man?
I&apos;m ready; freedom awaits.
*You bring the rock down and the warm metal of the lamp shatters like glass. Smoke shoots out in all directions, twisting in the wind before it takes shape before you.*
Shoot forking sparks at all enemies within the area, dealing [1] and setting Shocked.
...
Alas! Poor soul. Better that you weren&apos;t acquainted.
*He laughs heartily.*
And the waiter says &apos;why the long faces?&apos; Right?! I love that joke.
Moving on...
Our egg is back! Our egg is here!
Wizard Voice
Sneaking Failed!
I figured we&apos;ll hold tight for now - just &apos;til we&apos;re sure the way&apos;s clear. &lt;i&gt;Then &lt;/i&gt;we&apos;ll make a run for Driftwood.
*Stand straight and tall. His words shall not leave the room!*
Don&apos;t let &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;keep you.
*You&apos;re just trying to escape, and Exter said she had some information.*
A worn out piece of paper compiled by Braccus Rex himself, investigating the topic of a rare ancient armour.
This will not stand. You will finish what she started. You will unleash the Deathfog upon Arx.
[DWARF] *Tell him you&apos;re sworn to Duna and no other.*
You are discreet. The Doctor approves. He will see you now.
That, my friend, depends on your definition of &apos;okay&apos;. There&apos;s Voidwoken out there and they&apos;re coming for us...
Well, hello again.
Word has reached me, you see, through a very &lt;i&gt;sour&lt;/i&gt; grapevine indeed, that you turned your back on your fellow passengers. Left us to fend for ourselves...
Cannot turn Invisible.
Fiddle with the engine
*Shake your head and leave.*
*He takes a pull from a water canteen, then splashes some over his bloodstained hands.*
*Bid him speak.*
*She bends to grab a rag, wiping her blood-smeared hands. She looks up and sees you.*
B-b-bloody f-freezing! We can&apos;t stay here!
*Your fist connects with his cheekbone and you feel the stomach-curdling crack of bone beneath your hand. Blood streams from his nose, yet he stirs not at all.*
*Shake her hand vigorously. It&apos;s a pleasure!*
And thanks.
*He gives you the slightest nod of acknowledgement.*
I &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;you.
Against all odds, I&apos;m alive, and I&apos;ve plenty left to look forward to!
I am sorry, Lohse.
I&apos;m sorry!
Cursed Blood Cloud
Beach - Shipwreck
Out of the prison camp, into the bog! You watch my back, I&apos;ll watch yours.
Come on... lives are at stake.
Son.
Gareth returned to the Lady Vengeance, haunted by events ashore.
Shoes of Daring
It thinks we will be dictated to by flesh?
Misty Diamond
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Enter freely, Child of Duna. But bring none of foreign blood - they are not welcome.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Cat Meow
A real Source collar! This is the best day of my life! Come here, Sourcerer, I&apos;m going to a put a stop to your shenanigans for real!
I wish I could swim.
*Ask Sebille if she ever thought she&apos;d be responsible for killing a god.*
My, that&apos;s so kind of you to say!
These bodies have been purged.
How &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; heart-warming.
Just say the word, Lohse, and I&apos;ll summon a flood large enough to end this - all of this - once and for all.
You words are cruel, lizard. My hospitality wears thin - leave me.
*When she leaves she kisses you briefly, a hint of regret in her eyes.*
We told Stewart that we&apos;d killed the cook. He ran to the Magisters to take credit.
Nobody wants this in their face.
[BEAST] *She&apos;s working for Lohar? That&apos;s the person you need.*
*She gives you a steady, defiant stare.*
*Marvel at the level of security. It&apos;s almost as if they knew you were coming.*
Not many would show such resolve! As such I put the fate of all lizards in your hands without reservation.
*Tell her you sobered up. Promise to be on your best behaviour. Try not to smirk.*
Mystical Small Masterwork Rune
TENTACLE SMASH!
*Leave the spirit to her sanctimony.*
&apos;s what I said. Wabbit!
Save Mari.
We... we lost some of the wounded... there was nothing I could do...
*Answer with a kiss, then all the rest.*
But our desires are futile; they are hollow, unless we can learn his name!
*She eyes you suspiciously.*
Ifan no longer believes a single person should be Divine. Divinity should be shared by all in Rivellon.
Oh, madam, I can&apos;t say I know. Besides, I&apos;m not at liberty to discuss...
Cone angle: [3]&lt;br&gt;Length: [2]
Not scared, are ya? Go on. Down the hatch.
Who&apos;s &lt;i&gt;drowning? &lt;/i&gt;The people in the water are drowning. Can&apos;t you hear their hearts beat on, even as they hold their breath?
*A sudden, vivid sensation of floating in darkness assails you. There&apos;s something in there with you... something... hungry and corrupt... you can&apos;t breathe, you can&apos;t br - *
My, but what a scowl! Seems to me you could use a touch of... magic.
*She looks to the nearby device, and an urge engulfs you - an urge to power down the device, to release Windego from her cell.*
To face uncertainty and to sally forth regardless: Therein lies true courage. Isn&apos;t that right, Quercus?
Hannag offered to deepen our mastery of our Source powers, by drawing Source from animals. This process would kill the animals, but we accepted nonetheless.
[MYSTIC] *Lay your palm on her forehead and picture soothing scenes passing from you to her.*
*The Magister Priestess has her head bowed against her staff as she murmurs a prayer for the dead.*
Mody
You attempt to honour us during the ritual. You attempt to honour Sarias. You help remember him.
I am sorry to tell you, but there is no such way. The battle for divinity is about to begin in earnest. The other gods and their chosen will try to outflank us just like we must outflank them.
Commendable. And yet she is the most mysterious of the Seven. Despite your perusals, no doubt that tome taught you little. So please allow me to enlighten you.
*Ignore Sadha&apos;s plea and step through the portal.*
GRRRRRRRRRR!
*Then your fingers grow cold to the bone. Suddenly, you are just a person standing in a cavern, clinging to a stone tablet as if it were a life raft.*
Even if you are as versed in the art of eloquence as I am, that our swords will be doing a lot of the talking from here on out goes without saying.
All life, after all, sustains itself by consumption. Like the grass feeds the herd and the herd feeds the hunter, so you must feed, for instance, on these...
Kiss. My. Feet.
The Seekers told me the same thing. They told me I could rise. I could be the next Divine. I fell for it. Well, who wouldn&apos;t, eh?
Jellyroom
Note to self - forbid the children from bringing pets to class in future. Buttons may be a very cute kitten, but it causes too much of a distraction every time Iris brings him along.
*Say you&apos;ll do it.*
Spoiled like green milk, like a stinking egg! His hands were bigger than his head! He wanted and wanted but didn&apos;t know enough, never enough...
*You won&apos;t reject the God that saved your life! Turn and walk away.*
*No sooner have these words left your mouth than she turns about and grabs you in a stranglehold. You feel the tip of a long needle being pushed a little ways into your neck.*
I could truly do with some shut-eye after all that&apos;s happened...
Emanating arcane energy, this mask makes the wearer appear to be an elf.
Teleport when hit with weapons or weapon skills.
I thank you, but of course we both know none of us will ever be truly free until the God King is defeated once and for all. Facing him will be... indescribable.
Potions
I serve all who seek aid, sir.
My lady, the fugitives have been found cowering piteously in a makeshift camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way is barred by noxious plants, mayhap ensorcelled by the fleeing inmates. However, I&apos;ve persevered and found a way through! As the vigour of the Sourcerers is defeated by our own holy vigour, so here too does like defeat like. I - Radek! - discovered the very secret when a fierce storm descended from the air and temporarily deactivated one of the blue bulbs, allowing me the opportunity to pen this note in relative safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send our best elemental masters and we&apos;ll be upon the escapees with no delay...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magister Radek
Matters more urgent than the honour of our houses? You shame us, kinswoman.
But enough talk. I need more. I need your Source. I need your &lt;i&gt;life, &lt;/i&gt;undead.
Warning Letter
Justinia&apos;s Favour
She ain&apos;t detailed, but she ain&apos;t wrong. The Godwoken are our hope that a new Divine can be born.
*To be soulless is a horrible, empty fate. You seek out Braccus&apos; vault, but the moment you reach the soul jar, he ensnares you.*
Incandescent Remover
Ah yes. Discretion is the soul of valour, as they say. I may have a job for an adventurer of great valour and discretion. Interested?
Perhaps there is some truth in that. Very well, she will not die today.
New Chapter
Inconspicuous Contraption
You need to have a proper name for your Campaign.
*In your ecstasy you feel the edge of the bed against your leg, and suddenly you&apos;re falling, both of you, laughing together as the mattress receives you both...*
Corpse Explosion Wood Heavy
I don&apos;t get it.
Outmatched
The world needs a power to protect it and you are the key, Fane. But you have fallen so far...
Whyn&apos;t you take it. If they offer you a round of cards, this&apos;n guarantees you a win. It&apos;s called the Sparkler. Whoever&apos;s got it gets the pot. Filched it from that hog Griff himself.
*Step away. You&apos;d like to speak to Murga.*
To turn your back on your calling is to turn your back on me, on Rivellon. And every single corpse you saw bleeding out on the Lady Vengeance.
*The Paladins come. All Magisters are under arrest. For treason! The shame! The anger! You will not go down without a fight.*
Lrm the Accursed
I&apos;m not crazy am I? That person I was just speaking with teleported away from me! Bloody rude way to end a conversation, to say the least...
Yes. But are &lt;i&gt;they?&lt;/i&gt;
Really? And then you woke up on the beach? Aww man!
The key. Under the barrel. You can hide in the house. Just... please... &lt;i&gt;please don&apos;t hurt me!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you won&apos;t let him take to the seas once more.*
The Red Prince returned home a hero -
*Ask him if he wants to know how you got that scar.*
