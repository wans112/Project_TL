*Your eyes flutter closed and you feel dragged down by a suffocating weight. You see what she sees: eternal darkness, heavy and fuligin rich.*
Gleaming with the lustre of far-off sunsets, this Ancient Empire ring is inscribed with an elaborately curlicued &apos;Hannag.&apos;
Mend Metal
From road to dream to destiny, Red Prince. May the goddess keep you safe!
Foolish. But no more foolish than doing nothing and waiting for the dagger fated to pierce my back.

I will soon confront him, with you by my side. My life and my liberty I place in these soft, strong hands of yours.
Go slither somewhere else, scales. I don&apos;t have time to talk.
Bless target character or surface.
I&apos;m trying to write about Zorl-Stissa, the graceful warrior. Please, no more distractions.
And after it&apos;s done you lie down in the box once more with wet hands, and mad red thoughts.
Before you go, I must first tell you of the second part of the plan. Follow through and I will endeavour what you desire most: the exorcism of your demon.

Until next time. Enjoy! Or don&apos;t. We&apos;ll chat about it soon enough!
*Stare back and say: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Me.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask where you should start the search.*
A contract is a contract. Lone Wolves don&apos;t ask questions, we just do the work.
But of course I won&apos;t refuse you: I&apos;ll do my best to drive the demon out. However, there&apos;s much work to be done first.
You must strike at her heart. Do this for me. Do this for all of us. &lt;i&gt;Set us free.&lt;/i&gt;
Towards A Crafting Philosophy
*She moves in small circles, your bodies joined like they were made for each other, like they were never meant to be apart.*
Good. Take my knowledge, and use it wisely on your path, Godwoken. Farewell.
I haven&apos;t decided yet. Perhaps I&apos;ll lay low for a while...
The Dreamer
&apos;Nemesis.&apos;
Many thanks for your help... but who are you?
*You didn&apos;t mean to offend: apologise for the intrusion.*
I watch the gate. Who goes there?
Not my plans. &lt;i&gt;Its &lt;/i&gt;plans - the presence within. It shows me such things.
Ingredient. Can be used to create a skillbook.
There are some sins I can&apos;t forgive. This desecration... this is one of them. I. Can. &lt;i&gt;Replace you!&lt;/i&gt;
And now, I am happy to offer you that same mercy.
You know, now that I think about it... Kristof was got rid of last week, wasn&apos;t he? Who the hell are you then? Buvver off!

Never trusssted Wordlessss. Tell Sssallow it shall be done. The God King getsss what the God King wantsss.
&lt;i&gt;We will be whole. But if you must be shattered first, so be it.&lt;/i&gt;
*Write &apos;Lucian&apos;.*
It&apos;s the compassionate thing to do. We&apos;ll end its misery. Close your eyes, little doggie...
*Remark that whatever spirit resides in this wood must have had a previous existence - can it remember anything?*
Time is an asset, dear. A dwindling one. Now please hurry along and do as you promised.
I have to know your intentions, before I help you. What do you mean to do with the power of Divinity, if you succeed?
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*The cat sighs dolefully, and looks away.*
*Tell her you just had a really interesting experience upstairs with a rather sexy lizard.*
*Say you disagree. You remain adamant that you&apos;re the best candidate.*
Alright...
Summon a Source Hound.

A thief&apos;s on the loose!
This place? Well... hum... the fleas seem very happy, at the very least!
*Resist the urge to punch him and demand your reward.*
*The Paladin looks up at you through a bruised and swollen eye. She spits a gob of blood on the cobbles before she speaks.*
*Thank them. Wish them the best of luck and take your leave.*
Do you think I&apos;d fall for that routine? You&apos;ve killed for the last time!
Folks locked away with demons; demons bound by enchanted chains - there&apos;s something barbaric about it all.
*Tell Gareth you are willing to help him.*

And a sturdy elf you are! Penny for a sick dog?
&apos;scuse you. I&apos;m here with someone else.
*Ask how her hunt for the spores goes.*
The Sweet Shackles of Pain
*Promise that the Gods will fix this injustice.*
[IFAN] *Tell her you had a device just like that once: it&apos;s a portal to safety, right?*
Oh thank you! Thank you thank you thank you! You&apos;re not as mean as you look stupid!
*The spirit of a dwarf woman stares despondently at her body and those of her loved ones.*
Squirrels change, don&apos;t they Quercus? Priorities change. If we do not adapt, we are sure to perish.
*The arm snaps free from the stones. No sign of a body underneath.*
With the last of his powers, Lord Withermoore removed the barrier blocking our way.
What would that be? A pyre? Ashes and oblivion? No... I was an elf, then a part of the forest, then a slave... now I am a voyager. I have to embrace the cycle - it is the way of my people.
*The elf murmurs, stroking her armour as if soothing a wild beast. It is incomplete - and made, it seems, from the vines themselves.*
Dusty Tome
*Urge Gareth to calm. Alexandar is not Damian. He can keep his father&apos;s promise alive.*
Boy&apos;s a surgeon by training, isn&apos;t he? Of course there&apos;s blood. Now don&apos;t you go running around here spoiling his name.

*The sculpture looks impossibly heavy, yet turns with little effort.*
What rats?
*Turn away from the scene. Better if you stay out of it.*

*Say that you want rangers - to hit the Magisters from a distance.*
Dead Magister Knight
*Tell her you&apos;ll return it to her later, and take your leave.*
You&apos;re so, so stupid.
*She lets loose a long sigh. She inhales. She sighs again.*
Why did you trigger the Deathfog before the elves had a chance to escape? Why? &lt;i&gt;Why?&lt;/i&gt;
At the schoolhouse we met Sister Schori, a drudanae-addicted excommunicated priest.
I am telling you this is none of your concern. &lt;i&gt;Let the dead rest&lt;/i&gt;.
You cad! Oh, I hope that vault exists. I hope that&apos;s it&apos;s trapped from top to bottom. And I hope those snares will rob you of yourself, limb per ripped off limb!
There was a fire rune and a private letter on the body of a lizard cultist we found. The letter described a secret path of symbols leading to a trial of the dragon, for which the rune was key.
In the woods, we came upon four statues surrounding a brazier.
*Deal. Give him the money.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54] gold)

But - learned a trick since last we met, have I.
*State that you are hunting Dallis the Hammer. Does he know where she might be?*
Leave me to my ruminations. I have many memories to comb. I cannot forget - not now.
The Mother suffers, kin. But I dare to hope. I dare to hope for the future of the elves.
Margret&apos;s... Well. Aren&apos;t you an annoying little snoop? Fine. If that&apos;s what you wish, then it&apos;s what you&apos;ll have. But do keep your eyes on the prize and off my private records.
My respect has to be earned, not expected. I hope our new Divine is capable of humility - I would hate to think that I helped usher &lt;i&gt;another &lt;/i&gt;tyrant into the world.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him you&apos;ll do what you like. You don&apos;t take orders from toffee apples.*
*Looking around the intimidating vista, wonder what Ifan thinks you should do now.*
Don&apos;t know when she came or where she came from. One day, she was just there, and the queen was drinkin&apos; down the poison drippin&apos; out of her. It started with arrests. The poor would come askin&apos; for alms, and she&apos;s sweep &apos;em into the cells of Margan D&apos;un.
I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like humans, for instance.
*Keep humming with her.*
The agony. I c-c-can&apos;t... I can&apos;t do this any longer!
Are you looking for a battle now?
Get away from me, you Lone Wolf tosser.
We pulled the right levers and continued on.
*He leans closer, his voice tight.*
Rock Coffin Cache
At the time, I didn&apos;t realise how bad it was. I was glad you defended me. But things are different now.
Gear Type
We were betrayed by the unlikeliest of people - Lucian the Divine himself...
*Ask her about Amadia.*
Do what you will, just don&apos;t cause them any more suffering.
*His nose twitches in itchy frustration.*
We don&apos;t have time for this. We&apos;ve got a houseful of Silent Monks to guard here!
Mass Corpse Explosion Skillbook
You&apos;ve &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a soft spot for that woman. Do you really think she didn&apos;t know &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what releasing Deathfog into Arx would mean? Don&apos;t be fooled your own blind devotion. I may have planted the seed, but your beloved queen gleefully tended to it.
You have had many chances to prove yourself, and failed each time. &lt;i&gt;No more. &lt;/i&gt;I grant you a new form - one more befitting of your miserable talents.
*Ask where you can find these Masters.*
How... how is this possible? Shouldn&apos;t I be a Silent Monk now?
*The blessing fades. The spirit&apos;s hands are stilled.*
*As he turns away, the skeleton hesitates. He turns back to you, thrusting a golden amulet into your hand.*

Still, here we are. I trust I needn&apos;t remind you about our agreement.
*You warmly tell the tale of the dragon, but despite your best efforts, you notice that your knowledge of legends and monsters is somehow upsetting the child.*
*The Paladin shakes her head.*
You&apos;re really not gonna help them?
*Tell her you have other needles to thread.*
Security Log&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most important area of focus this month is CELLAR SECURITY!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#02756&lt;br&gt;Barrels have arrived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#02757&lt;br&gt;Placement of Divine 2000 Turret Barrels complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;#02768&lt;br&gt; Don&apos;t stare into the Barrel!!!
*Tell the cat to back down or you&apos;ll smash its bones into dust.*
We&apos;ve learned that the remaining spores have been taken off Reaper&apos;s Eye.
Could be any invertebrate&apos;s leg, really. Ack.
*Look to the runes etched into the floor. What is going on here?*
This seems. Likely.
Roar and rage if you must, but you cannot harm me.
Battle Source Puppet
Here before the first face I&apos;ve seen in centuries, am I. It might do to make an ally.
Piercing
Go ahead.
*Warn her that she&apos;s meddling in matters of immense importance. To continue would be... unwise.*
*Ask if she doesn&apos;t want to talk first - about everything that&apos;s happened, about the gods, about the demon in her head...*
Once, although not by a Godwoken. My assistant did not believe that one had to be chosen by a god to become Divine.
Found within the nightmare realms, this unique spear has the ability to cloud the vision and the dreams of any it strikes.
Ha! Haha. This bleeding, rotting, godsforsaken, infernal bog.
You&apos;re the Prime Scion. It had to be you. The other Scions knew you - welcomed you. They sought out their own killer.
*Ask about this goddess that protects her.*
Ah, my little furry friend. May the afterlife be sweeter for you than this one...
But... here you are. My chosen - my Godwoken - our hope. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;will undo what has been done.
*Tell her you&apos;re glad to have established which of you is most desirable. Then walk way.*
But the true pain came after. When I lost all of my own volition.
Brothers! I have uncovered a Black Ring conspirator! A spy! An assassin! Defend your Lord Commander! To arms!
I&apos;d sooner cut my tongue out than lie to you, Alexandar. I know nothing of any escapees.
