*...a playful you, light-hearted and armed with a rapier wit. But then the Sallow Man&apos;s grin becomes a snarl, and his outreached hand grasps at you, grabs hold of a part of you, and &lt;i&gt;pulls...*&lt;/i&gt;
It was a pleasant fancy. And you would know something about fancies, wouldn&apos;t you?
Not like this! This smells &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;bad. This smells... &lt;i&gt;evil.&lt;/i&gt;
*Notice he doesn&apos;t have a Source collar on and ask him how he got rid of it.*
*Fast asleep now, he mumbles no more.*
*She looks you up and down.*
*The flower&apos;s sweet fragrance fills the air.*
I see it. You, too, follow a path consumed by fire.
I submitted them all. All seven of us did. Allowed them to be stolen by a man named Lucian.
*Fane pulls back as you reach for him. He looks away, his shoulders slumped.*
*Her work was an abomination. Consume her Source voraciously.*
That&apos;s the spirit! But I gotta tell ya - ya probably want to see Murga &apos;round the corner before ya draw blood. &lt;i&gt;She&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; the champion and she&apos;s fair partic&apos;lar about who she&apos;ll fight.
Well no, or I wouldn&apos;t have joined up with you, would I? Don&apos;t worry - I&apos;m sure your getup will fool most people hook, line, and sinker. I&apos;m sensitive. Knew who you were the moment you rolled up.
*She looks over her left arm; traces an empty spot with her needle.*
Orders For a Masked Servant
[NOBLE] *Insist he quit blubbering. Such behaviour doesn&apos;t suit a man of his stature.*

*Yawn* Is this almost over?!
The companion has &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;bonded&lt;/font&gt; with their recruiter and can develop a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/font&gt; only with that character.

If yow want to get paid, Lone Wolf, yow&apos;ll earn it. Start with killin&apos; them Divine Order pigs down there. &lt;i&gt;Move, merc!&lt;/i&gt;
Now don&apos;t you worry, I have no intention of sending you after this arch-demon. There are few enough Godwoken as it stands for me to force them into any &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; danger.
Oh, I... I&apos;m sorry, I thought...
Awwww yeah! This is the good stuff too, like what Kemm has in his garden with the Yarrow. Like right... therrre.
Lucian&apos;s blessings, but I can&apos;t bring myself to do it...
It is good to see you. We were afraid. We were so afraid...
I &lt;i&gt;knew &lt;/i&gt;this man - I&apos;m not about to go rifling through his belongings!
You are a guest no longer. You are meat, and master has had his fill. &lt;i&gt;Leave&lt;/i&gt;.
*Lohse glows with a gentle power; the air around her seems almost to vibrate. Her smile, however, hasn&apos;t changed at all.*
Global Pause
*Say that you were supposed to meet someone in town. You must be in the wrong building.*
Sebille! You&apos;ve come not a moment too soon. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt; Even &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt;

Talk to the sleeping man.

*Headbutt him with all your strength.*
I watch the gate. Who goes there?
Sworn
Well good thing you don&apos;t have my job, &apos;cause then you&apos;d be wrong and you&apos;d be poor! Boss has a buyer for nearly all our stock - a top price, too.
We... we came to free an elf called Verdas from Fort Joy. He was a &lt;i&gt;Godwoken &lt;/i&gt;- he could have been the next Divine... but we failed him...
*She gives you a sad look.*
Devour a fresh corpse to restore your Vitality and receive a Damage buff.
Wait... no! It&apos;s starting again!
I see. One does not easily mistake &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; orders. But where are the others?
You&apos;re getting the hang of this. Very good. There may be more to come yet.
*Bow your head and whisper a desperate plea to Tir-Cendelius. If his temple still stands, perhaps he is in a better way than the others.*
This is only here for show. Not that the Voidwoken will care.
Trial by Fire
Be well, Sebille. Good-bye.
He helped engineer the Path of Blood for Lucian. Well, most of it, anyway. He&apos;s a genius, but his ways are, let&apos;s say, &lt;i&gt;idiosyncratic. &lt;/i&gt;You may tell the toy-maker Sanders I sent you.
*Explain that your wand is out of power.*
Lucky ain&apos;t the word I&apos;d use. Nor&apos;s patient, so go slither somewhere else, lizard. I&apos;ve enough scales to deal with.
Explore the desert.
The Void itself is hunting down the Gods, leeching us in ways we never thought possible. Droplet by droplet we are being drained.
*Tell him to get to the part where you get paid.*
Giant Fire Salamander
So &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;is Fort Joy.
Dreamer Pipe
Your decisions have consequences. He learned that lesson the hard way, as do we all.
I&apos;ll hear their silent screams for the rest of my wretched life.
Yep. You&apos;ll do.
*Touch the statue with the bare skin of your hand.*
Give
&lt;i&gt;You aided our master on Bloodmoon Island. He offers this advice in thanksss...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;look to the lizard consulate. Strong magic can be found there... dreamer magic.&lt;/i&gt;
The polymorphed cows are dead.
Watch &apos;em dance.
Now here I sit. My closest companion: gone. Our precious cargo, worth more than Lucian&apos;s right ring: lost to the beast-infested wilds.

*Square up to him. This is the world he chose? Under the rule of the God King?*
*Say you hope he&apos;s learned his lesson.*
&apos;ey up!
Your price is fair. We part ways, amicably.

*Tell her Papa told you to kill Peeper but you didn&apos;t. As a result, you had to fight ten Voidwoken chicks &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a Voidwoken Peeper.*
Desist. I warn you. Or we&apos;ll part company forever, and you&apos;ll be no more than yet another foe.
Good work there, good work. I can tell you&apos;ve got chops. Say, you were on the ship here with me, weren&apos;t you?
Retreat from me! I may have lost my Source but I can still best a puny dwarf like yourself...
*Ask what he plans to do now.*
Indeed, spending time in your company is about as pleasant as providing shelter for a pineapple in one&apos;s rectal region.
Now, we&apos;ll see something. We&apos;ll see what happens when everyone can harness their own divinity.
Nope! Your barnacle is stuck there - but you have the chance to go your own way. To make your own choices.
*Change the subject.*
Now let&apos;s be... Divine.
*The spirit shakes his head as you near. He does not wish to speak.*

[This manuscript about the orc god Vrogir is - or was - clearly in progress. It says very little about the origin of the orcs or their scarcity in modern Rivellon, using a lot of words to communicate precious little.]

This is nonsense!

Well done. The Red Princess is dead. This is excellent news.
*Ask what he wants you to do.*
Backstabbed!
Bugger off. I&apos;m busy.
Yeah. Same story here. Reckon in my case they might actually be right, though.
*Scowl and say you won&apos;t be spoken to like that by a gruesome creature like her.*
Sir, at the service of the realm! Sir!
*Smile broadly and regale him with the tale.*

May Lucian return, pilgrim. May Lucian return.
The time for fealty is gone; the fight to survive is the only remaining battle.
You are now a guiding star. I can only ask you don&apos;t lead your people astray. I fear, however, that this Adramahlihk would cast you in shadow.
We found the crew belowdecks, greatly diminished. Malady used her last reserves of power to return us to the mortal world.
*Say yes - you&apos;ve been making the most of them during combat!*
Fool! You should be locked up in the Joy with all those like you...
*Decline. You have your own affairs to tend to.*
Withered Heart
*You close your eyes once more. Now the vault before you sings to you. You raise your hand to it - it opens to your touch. From the vault you take a sword. It&apos;s weightless, yet it feels &lt;i&gt;extremely &lt;/i&gt;powerful...*
The Mother Tree is dead.
*Raise your eyebrows. You&apos;ve never known dreaming to be a responsibility.*
*Give them your broken Source collar.*
*Hiss*
*Hannag looks from you to the dead Magisters and back again.*
You should go. You&apos;re stirring up the houseflies.
I must say - I rather liked this more than anything else we&apos;ve been up to. A shame that real life has somethin&apos; more... turbulent in mind, eh?
I know a Godwoken when I see one.
Stop listening
Like I said: they&apos;re either dead or silenced. And gods know I couldn&apos;t tell which fate is worse!
Damian&apos;s teeth - fine! Walk away. I&apos;ll do it myself...
You &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be back.
Looks like the magic has worn off, though. Sad!
And what are you, sweet one, if not &lt;i&gt;magic?&lt;/i&gt;
Burn the remains in the Eternal Fire.
An ancient amulet that contains five jewels ready to be steeped in Source. To charge it, wear the amulet when receiving an infusion of Source.
BRACCUS is a bloody, rotten, thieving, very, very awful fellow. Some even call him a cur! A CUR is...?
*Inform her of her loss; her child is dead.*
As per your own testimony, you can cook, tailor and groom. Well, that just about settles it!
*Ask about the message he received before you left for the island...*
That so? I can see that. You&apos;re her type. Tell me: What does a beauty like you know about Zoor?
Lure Higba outside Driftwood.
*This spirit deserves no words, no empathy. Drink deeply from his supply of Source.*

He&apos;s hoping you&apos;ll bring... &lt;i&gt;friends.&lt;/i&gt;
Must have been eclipsed in the presence of divinity.
Use your power, Scion, to end the Mother Tree.
I could do that. I could. But seeing as the ring has a bit o&apos; Source to it, like as not, going in there&apos;ll attract Voidwoken. All things equal, &apos;tween an angry wife and Voidwoken I&apos;m leaning towards the wife.
*Sigh* What next, then?
No entry - it is forbidden.
Alas! Poor soul. Better that you weren&apos;t acquainted.
Yarrow&apos;s key let us into the Magisters&apos; quarters. Escape may lie beyond.
