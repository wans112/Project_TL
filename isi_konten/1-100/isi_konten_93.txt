[JESTER] *Tell the Magister that on second thought, it was just an unfortunate-looking turtle.*
Murga died, but we defeated the Voidwoken and proved ourselves.
*Ask him for the truth about the gods.*

But who didn&apos;t, then? He was driving the Black Ring back; soon to rout them entirely.
The right decision. You wouldn&apos;t want this dream to turn into a nightmare, would you?
*Tell him that one of his buddies really wants you to open the chest.*
Escape Fort Joy.
Explode radius
*Ask the ghost how he came here himself.*
*The golden-haired woman in front of you casts an appraising eye over your attire. Slowly and deliberately, she winks at you.*
I know my brother walks the Halls now, but I miss him dearly. And I feel closest to him here in Arx, near where he died on the Path of Blood.
*A slight grin crosses the spirit&apos;s face. Whether her smile is sincere or not, you can&apos;t be sure.*
That is the right answer.
W. Herbert&apos;s Guide To Joyful Gardening
By the Seven, I said MOVE!
But don&apos;t let that dismay you, for these sins will be washed clean by the knowledge you committed them to save all of existence. To save your kin, and your loved ones, and the world they live in.
Penny for a hard-working beggar?
*Shrug ambiguously. You&apos;re not sure what you think about that statement.*
Green Ball
Well now, weren&apos;t that something.
[LOHSE] *Shrug. It doesn&apos;t matter. Another day, another passenger.*
Indications are that Isbeil may be an agent of the God King.
Dead Magister Inquisitor
And you&apos;re just a waddling toddler with *snort* hairy underarms and beer-breath. Now leave my sight, lest I make an unseemly squeal.
*Say it&apos;s a shame. Secrecy among the Black Ring would weaken their strategy, after all.*
Cluck cluck cluck!
And then, when you told you loved me, all of me... awoke.
*He spins on one heel, and begins to stride onwards, keen eyes scouring the environment for any dangers. He turns to wave you along, eyes glittering in the swampy gloom.*
Oh... bugger.
It&apos;s no wonder he took an interest in the White Magisters&apos; crimes. Their betrayal is one against the late Divine himself.
How lucky you are then, to break your insular habits with my exalted companionship.
What a magnificent creature! To bathe in your splendor inspires me! If only the Empress was here...
(Shhhhh. They&apos;re still here.)
*Demand to know why you shouldn&apos;t be here.*
Chateau Flaminia XXXI
Split
*Wink and say you&apos;re not from around here. There must be some mistake.*
Ah! I&apos;d heard there was a fresh face here. So glad the rumours were true.
You... a &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt;... would dare call me a... a...
We are not the Void, mortal. We are of the world. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are of the Void.
Unacceptable! I&apos;ve never dined on anything less than a dozen-course dinner, and I don&apos;t intend to do away with the custom.
*Grasp the hilt.*
The wench is hardly divine! She stole children away from Braccus so he could feast on their Source. Even my iron stomach was turned.
M-O-O-O-O-O-O! *stamp*
Do you not sense the truth? I am the Devourer. The Original. The Uncowed. The Dragon Above All. And I have chosen you to be my champion.
That&apos;s it! That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;it!&lt;/i&gt;
A richly-hued dye siphoned from the blood of thousands of locusts.
*Act confused. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt; What&apos;s he talking about?*
*Mock her, saying that all Magisters deserve similarly ignominious ends.*
So, can you make it?
*The Magister gives you a long look.*
*The turtle ambles in a slow circle.*
Gloves of the Pilgrim
I&apos;m a prisoner of course; do you think I&apos;d be here of my own free will?
Now please... I must return to my work...
A letter bearing an official seal of some form.
&lt;i&gt;You do way too much talking and not enough dying.&lt;/i&gt;
Defiled by fog... destroyed by failure... Beast... you are &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;.
Lohar ain&apos;t gonna be pleased.
Yes, it did miss my little revelation earlier. Still, better late than never...
There is no shame in failing to become the One.
Ha. As though you don&apos;t know. This is the one place in all of Reaper&apos;s Coast where blood roses actually thrive. I suppose you just stumbled in by mistake?
Heh, heh, heh...
Backsword
Starstruck
*As you lean in he takes a step back. A sudden look of indignation clouds his face.*
Lohar may trust you; doesn&apos;t mean I do.
*Tell her you&apos;re heading to the same wedding, at the behest of the same man.*
Here to trade?
*Wonder if he can set up a meeting with Zaleskar.*
I can&apos;t open the rift!
*An intense-looking man steps between the thug and the elf and rolls up his sleeves, revealing well-muscled and heavily-scarred arms. You recognise him: it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Ifan&lt;/i&gt;, who you met aboard the ship on the way here.*
Inconceivable! Listen closely then:
*Eyes closed, the tiger seems to be praying. Her nose twitches as she senses your presence.*
*Point out that she&apos;s not making art anymore. She&apos;s dead.*
*The Red Prince approaches the spirit, intent on conversation.*
Explosive Trap Scroll
Pickpocketing
That belongs to the original - &lt;i&gt;elven - &lt;/i&gt;owner. Doesn&apos;t it add character?
I united with Sadha. The rebirth of the dragonkin is nigh.
You... look familiar. I hope... I hope you don&apos;t hurt anyone!
Ingratitude doesn&apos;t become you, Lohse.
Amadia is the blessed mother of magic. All that use it can trace their skill back to her grace.
We weren&apos;t the only ones who noticed, either. Not every Godwoken we found was... alive. And so the Seekers were born.
*The spirit backs away, its eyes wide and trembling. It doesn&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. Or worse, perhaps it does...*
Toggle your Helmet
Rumour says that Justinia, queen of the dwarves, may attend a wedding in Arx.
*Windego lies on the floor, her essence all but drained from her frail bones. She shifts with a light clatter at the sight of you.*
In Driftwood we met Reimond, a senior White Magister. While suspicious of us, he asked us to work for him against local dwarven criminals.
No comfort - only recompense. Against Dallis&apos; cronies, against the abominations that carry out their commands. The monks do the dirty work, and the Whites keep their robes clean. &lt;i&gt;Convenient.&lt;/i&gt;
My own master... do you know of Braccus Rex?
Unadorned Belt
All&apos;s I want is my supplies. *Ahem* Happy to let this clown die in a gutter instead of my kitchen. Bring back my crate and you&apos;ve got yourself a deal.
In that case, perhaps we should reconsider one another&apos;s company.
*Ifan looks over at you with a grimace. The emotion flitting behind his eyes is hard to grasp. Is it sorrow? Shame? &lt;i&gt;Guilt?*&lt;/i&gt;
Leap
*Ask her if she&apos;s been to Arx before.*
Black Ring Sacrificial Dagger
&lt;b&gt;...did you truly expect to fool us so easily? The girl is our vessel, until we leave her a husk.&lt;/b&gt;
And I love you.
The gangle-legs have gone nuts for good this time! They&apos;re destroying the place for reasons too stupid to know!
Creaking Death
Come, we&apos;ve lost our Shield, but we still have each other.
And if it will not be done by your hands, then it will be done by mine.
*Broach the subject of the painting...*
NO! You must release the fog into Arx. IT IS TIME.
*The woods have grown chilly now that the sun has set. Annie shuffles across the picnic blanket and huddles against you for warmth.*
You were warned - &lt;i&gt;more than once! &lt;/i&gt;Time you were taught a lesson...
I suppose so.
Butcher Knife
I see your mother raised you very well indeed - rare, for a lizard, but all the more impressive. You and my Kniles might even get along. What brings you to Driftwood, darling?
*Ask to see her wares.*
I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;free.&lt;/i&gt;
At least this bloody show is ended then. Farewell, stranger.
*He hums one last refrain of the song... &apos;There&apos;s no smoke without fire, dark the air...&apos;*
Children&apos;s stories tell that the origin of this mushroom&apos;s glow comes from being struck by lightning. Of course, modern scholars laugh at such tales. But their laughter rings hollow, for even they don&apos;t know why the jellyroom glows.
&lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;care for  you, Lohse. &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am your friend. I know you better than they could ever dream of.
Knight of Duna
O&apos;en the chest there. Go on. You know you want to. O&apos;en the chest. There&apos;s loot innit. O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
*Tatcher bursts out laughing. Edden goes bright red.*
You have Lost
Ho-hum. I&apos;ve heard all this before! You really need to work on your storytelling skills.
*Wave them along. Fine. Let&apos;s get this over with. Enough is enough.*
This is what it means to be loyal. A foreign concept for you, of course. You left me to drown. When my path was clear, you sabotaged it.
Perhaps I&apos;ll give you a chance to explain yourself.
*Bow with your arms outstretched.*
Hrrm... well your speculations are right. We have had some desertions of late. Veterans, disgruntled with the new leadership...
Boiled Stardust Potion
[3] has taken [1] from [2]
A takeover? Mordus was caged up like the animal he was, I thought. Not that I&apos;m on top of everythin&apos;. Most everythin&apos;s a blank, like I&apos;m wakin&apos; up from a fever dream.
So the gods were bound and cursed by the Void, and the thing inside you - the &lt;i&gt;very powerful &lt;/i&gt;thing inside you - told you need to become the next Divine.
The Void itself is hunting down the gods, leeching us in ways we never thought possible. Droplet by droplet we are being drained.
What&apos;s got into you?
That&apos;s a lotta blood.
The last time I trusted someone, I was sealed in a tomb until my flesh turned to dust. I will not repeat that mistake.
Over there, on the tables. Those are my people&apos;s tablets!
*Tell him to follow his instincts... but he won&apos;t win any glory if he stays in this place.*
*Ask what&apos;s so important about these caves.*
*Consider this plea. No... you wouldn&apos;t abandon them.*
*Pat the barrel comfortingly. Promise it that everything will be okay.*
Share Divinity with the world.
*Tell it you had nothing to do with any betrayal.*
Craftsmanship
I was never very fond of that verse actually. But tell me, how would &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; like to be remembered? As a hero or a lover?
*Will yourself to repulse the spell - gently blow his serpent back to him.*
Accursed Slayer
Stolen Letter
When the only option is indiscriminate annihilation...

The possessed dwarf is dead.

I most certainly can.

Keep your voice low.
Ah, you were not satisfied either? Excellent, we have a unanimous consensus.
And every man, woman, and child could be a threat.
Spirit of Magister Greeve
As loyal as you were to your king, Fane. Yes, I know who you are. Time for you to embrace the darkness, again.
You need not fear me, but this island hides more dangers than my claws. I recommend you go, but should I find you broken on the beach, I will shed no tears.
*The squirrel&apos;s nose twitches as you approach, but the creature turns away before you can say anything. It seems he doesn&apos;t want to talk to you.*
Braccus has willed it. Trompdoy must abide. You have met the unfortunate guardian of this vault?
Hello little doggy. What a delightful snack you&apos;d make.
You&apos;re one hell of a fighter.
*She tugs at your clothes and growls in your ear:*
*Unperturbed, he holds up his index finger in a &apos;one moment please&apos; gesture, before tightening a hinge upon his gauntlet.*
You are punished!
*Nods.*
