Aldus! &lt;i&gt;Fedor!&lt;/i&gt; What could have happened to them?
This fool knows nothing! My inventions could tear through the enemy like a babe&apos;s scream. There are no weapons that can stand against mine!
Sir Reimond is on the docks, preparing to sail. Report to him at once. We can&apos;t take these dwarves alone - if they are behind this, we need reinforcements.
Answer me.

If I can sharpen it, it might serve.
Don&apos;t forget-you&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt;. These freaks&apos;d sooner throw you to a Voidwoken than loan you a bar of soap.
Please &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;, child? Watch you shrink away in fear? End your life here and now? Is that what you desire?!
Worse Than His Bark
Soldiers do love to take trinkets, and I have been a soldier a long time. Who knows what I have tucked away in my attic?
*Feed them.*
*Sigh.* Meow.
Shite. No idea. For all I know, she may not be in her right mind. Once the Black Ring&apos;s lies are swimmin&apos; in your blood, ya can&apos;t just squeeze &apos;em out.
Metal Crate

That won&apos;t do, you naughty little scamp! That won&apos;t do at all!
*Tell her you&apos;re investigating Lord Arhu&apos;s disappearance and the trail starts here.*
Step one: Find out who - or what - is trying to take control of my mind. Step two: Make it sorry it ever tried.
*Bid Sebille talk to the Scion.*

You would have my name on your skin? Then have it!
There are more Masters of the Source, more aspects of the Source to learn. The hunt continues, my child.
My mistake.
New Map
An ancestor tree! Pure grace in an undeserving world.
That doesn&apos;t sound promising, does it?
Sarcastic? Me? No, not at all. I&apos;d &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be sarcastic, me. Oh no. Not in the least.
Ah. Hello. Quite the blood-soaked journey has led you here. You are not who you once were... and I sense you are not yet who you &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be.

*Leya shakes her head and returns to her sulking.*
Hey! HEY! Over here!
There are other uses for a captive soul. We could absorb it...
*he pauses for a split second.*
*Scowl that you &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;a Sourcerer. None of this would have happened if your kind weren&apos;t being persecuted.*
Hrrm. Pearls before swine, clearly. I trust you can find your own way out. I must be getting back to my work.
*Look at her incredulously. Does she really expect you to believe any straight answer the &apos;Goddess of Mirth&apos; gives you?*
*Ask what happened to him.*
Does that really matter now? Right now? When your lungs&apos;re pumping their last few wheezes of air? When your heart&apos;s so close to stopping - for good?
*The look on this Silent Watcher&apos;s face cycles through a myriad of conflicting emotions in rapid succession. Malevolence, joy, curiosity, fear, love. Noticing you, a blank mask descends. Their expression becomes static.*
Have you forgotten what he has taken from &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt; My friends. My parents. My life - a life dedicated to service &lt;i&gt;at his father&apos;s side.&lt;/i&gt;
Slime
*The pedestal is from your own era - but unlike Aetera, it has kept its strength. Empty now, it once supported something powerful. This was the resting place of the Aeteran - until it was torn free, and borne away.*
One last Black Ring priestess survived the Void War. When the demons came, she fled into the wilderness, and there, after thirty-nine days and thirty-nine nights, she saw a man, calling her name from another plane. His name: Damian.
*Wish the family the best for the future.*
Now, let me ask you this - what, *ahem*, flavour of stew do you prefer? Do you like the strong and meaty variety or do you prefer it delicate and fragrant? If you get my meaning...
On his return to Rivellon, the Shadow Prince rewarded Red Prince for killing Sadha.
Does such a creature deserve anything less than death?
We agreed to help the elves.

So, there is still fresh meat slithering around this mire. Our master will be pleased.
&apos;Heroes&apos; Rest: Memorial to the Saviours of Driftwood, and the first of this region who joined Lucian the Divine. They lie here as comrades forever, eschewing the burial customs of their own people so that they can stand guard even in death.&apos;

[ARENA CHAMPION] *Flex your muscles and state that &lt;i&gt;winning &lt;/i&gt;is what you value most of all.*
*Place a hand on her head and softly whisper &apos;shh&apos;.*
My boy... no...
Now, good day to you. I&apos;ve work to be doing. &lt;i&gt;Private&lt;/i&gt; work.
*He&apos;s just about ready to talk, but cut a little deeper. One can never be too sure.*
Band of the Faithful
We&apos;ve decided to take the Soul Jar with us for now.
Now move along, so the &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;poetry lovers can appreciate me.
*Beast&apos;s whiskers stand on end like a porcupine&apos;s quills, ready to pierce whomever might stray too close.*
Decrease surface brush
There&apos;s no way we can trust this guy. Not while he&apos;s still living and breathing.
We may yet live on, we elves. I see the good in you, I see the bad in you, I see the all of you.
*Ask to hear more about what happened at the consulate.*
*Ask him if he&apos;s alright now. You thought he was about to perish.*

Greater Poison Ooze
Adventurous, confident, flexible, at times even clever, humans are dominant in Rivellon. They always play the hero in their own endless wars… even when they’re the villains.
Urghhh...
[UNDEAD] *Tell him that when it comes to race, things are a little more... complicated. A poem mightn&apos;t be able to capture your true nature, unfortunately.*
I admire your persistence, even if I am somewhat concerned at your low wit. That name shall not enjoy the grace of my tongue. Now kindly cease your idiotic questioning.
[JESTER] *Ask if he&apos;s always been such a sensible fellow.*
...no caste will ever tolerate a stain.
I bested that Voidwoken below us, you know. Dragged that scaly lump down there with my own two hands. So, since you can&apos;t hope to beat &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; it you want down here?
Alas, our royal master died and left us to rot. Now, we are promised a future by a new master. A master we serve by &lt;i&gt;choice&lt;/i&gt;, not by force.
As for that monstrosity you have made your shell, it was designed to die. And I think it time that design were fulfilled.
*Tell him you&apos;ve no intention of hunting your own countrymen. Refuse to shake his hand.*
We solved the great puzzle and gained access to the lower levels of the crypt complex.
Arx battled on.
Investigate the panel.
Home, if you don&apos;t mind.
Stop right there, thief!

Return to Charlie.
Now, the choice is yours: Will you use your new potential to raise dwarvenkind to its deserved heights? Or will you squander it for your own selfish needs?
You have done nothing. You who are not fit to judge, you earn nothing.
*She runs up to you and embraces you lovingly.*
This place had it coming, kin. They brought the Void upon themselves.
[DWARF] *Raise an unseen glass. You&apos;ll drink to that!*
Ungh!

*Growl!* Sourcerer... BARK! BARK! BARK!
&lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; Now? &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt;
But before you lope away, let me ask: you are travelling... alone, yes?
*Smirk. Of course. That&apos;s what you&apos;re doing...*
If you don&apos;t mind, I&apos;m somewhat... involved right now.
A gemlock? This won&apos;t open without the jewel that acts as the key...
Oh, come on! Where&apos;s your spirit? If you truly haven&apos;t got any fight left in you, we might as well end this here and now.
[HERO] *Tell him you seek wrongs to right in the darkest corners of Rivellon.*

But... our &lt;i&gt;souls?!&lt;/i&gt; There has to be another way!
To the stage. To the music once more.
*Tell the skull to mind its own business. You are not here to chat with human detritus.*
*Nod in thanks.*
Sure. Whatever suits you. Probably better for you in the end, anyway. I&apos;m not always myself. And sometimes not-myself is a bit... unpredictable.
They&apos;re d-dead! All of them! I&apos;m getting out of here!
That a fact? And here I thought our darling Bishop Alexandar was the only one.
Get away from me, you sow.
What?! No! No! I won&apos;t go, I won&apos;t go! GUARDS! GUARDS!
Defeat Sadha the Red Princess.
*Agree and ask him how this fine day is treating him.*
*He looks bereft.*
You found a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;shovel&lt;/font&gt;! If you find a suspicious-looking &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;mound&lt;/font&gt;, you may be able to dig something up.
*Try &apos;poison&apos;.*
*His mouth narrows in a thin line, and he casts his gaze to the ground.*
Set aside the ale and pay respects...
Would you care to try your hand at it? I have three varieties, each as aromatic as the last. I&apos;ve no doubt you could brew a delicious cup.
Edit
Just as well. It&apos;s not like this little discussion was getting us anywhere.
but he never did.
*Utter the phrase &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;

*The rat recognises you. It looks like it wants to tell you something.*
Get rid of these thugs. They&apos;re just in the way.

Can you do that? Or are you going to give up every time someone pushes you?
*She daggers you with a look.*
Kemm and his Paladins had just stormed the barracks and routed the Magisters.
The Advocate agreed to help us, but only if we do business with his master.
[SEBILLE] *Say they didn&apos;t. You allowed the Magisters to take you on purpose. You had your reasons.*
Blessed news! Now hurry, gather the Source you need from the fountain and perform the ritual again.
*The pedestal seems empty, as it if once supported something - something &lt;i&gt;powerful.&lt;/i&gt; You surmise that this was once the resting place of the Aeteran - until it was torn free, and borne away.*
