You smell nice. Like Master Arhu. Master Arhu was gone but then came back. And I got m&apos;ball back! Smelly man threw&apos;t away!
Let&apos;s give it some time, shall we?
Find the necromancers&apos; Soul Jars.
You are now &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Sworn&lt;/font&gt;. You no longer possess the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Bless&lt;/font&gt; skill. Instead, you possess the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Curse&lt;/font&gt; skill.
The Paladins of the Divine Order suspect that the secretive Magisters are mistreating Sourcerers.
*Ask what the thief looked like.*
Phoenix Egg
*Reason with it: tell it your name and how you long to be allies.*
*Demand to know what happened here. Everyone&apos;s dead!*
Are you &lt;i&gt;threatening&lt;/i&gt; me? That&apos;s adorable. How could I say no to someone that&apos;s trying so &lt;i&gt;hard? &lt;/i&gt;Go talk to the cheese vendor, over by the Good Counsel School. She&apos;ll tell you what you need to know about these thieves of yours.
&lt;i&gt;No more words!&lt;/i&gt; You have brought this upon yourself...
There are still hero slots available. Are you sure you want to continue?
Basic Selection
S&apos;already in my pipe. Nothin&apos; left for ya. Sorry.
*...and you know too what he&apos;s offering: &lt;i&gt;whatever you desire yourself to be.&lt;/i&gt; A new you, better than before. All your flaws, gone... forever.*
The Empire provides. But will you accept?
Love Grenade
Poor creature. Created for a sole purpose, and yet so ignorant of its function.
You think I&apos;m falling for that? You&apos;re under arrest!
Scratch Stingtail&apos;s name into your arm.
*Strange. Ask what he did to you.*
Go on! Speak! That&apos;s why you&apos;re here, isn&apos;t it?
Source Lich Cache
Considered a beverage by the hale and suicidal Dwarves of the frozen north.
Soaked a deep crimson at the tip, this rough-hewn spear appears to have been well-used by a lizard Dreamer with a penchant for blood magic.
For their well-being, its residents depended entirely on the benevolence of the new Divine.
You have earned the &lt;font color=008858&gt;Hero&lt;/font&gt; tag! Specific Hero options will be available to you from now on.
All the Godwoken have sworn to the God King or been purged.
*Though your fingers never actually touch, you can feel a grip stronger than any you&apos;ve felt before grab hold of your very soul, and next your soul takes flight.*
I used to be a slave, kept under the thumb of the Master: the bastard that made me hunt down my own kin. How did he do that, you ask?
*The glow fades and Fane seems to return to himself. He staggers slightly - exhausted by everything that&apos;s happened.*
*Smirk and say you wouldn&apos;t have pegged her as a defeatist.*
There&apos;s a murderer on the loose! You know anything about it?
rot
*You step back from the altar, the vision fading before you. As you leave, you notice a lunar rune has appeared, carved into the rock.*
*Ask what the Black Ring hoped to accomplish by fogging Arx.*
&lt;i&gt;Both, and none!&lt;/i&gt;
Lohse claims Divinity. I have no choice but to face her in combat.
N... no. I owe Alexandar... everything. If I die, I die. At least I do so with a clear conscience.
Spirit of Mudbarrow
You come too late. We are complete. One skin - and we only &lt;i&gt;begin.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you understood combat well from the beginning (and still do).*
So, don&apos;t say you&apos;re sorry. There is no shame in putting oneself first. I know I do.
For shame, Scion. Saheila says you hurt the Mother Tree. I spit on you. I spit on your name.
Lumberjack
How curious you are. Laughing when you should be screaming.
Yes - I bore witness to your feat at the gates. Your skills have proven invaluable to Arx - but I&apos;m afraid the terrors waiting within the consulate aren&apos;t so &lt;i&gt;tangible.&lt;/i&gt;
I take it you&apos;ve taken care of our foul-mouthed problem?
The curse has lifted! The dread voice of the king is gone!
This case is... dangerous.
Oh please. As if your lonely old bones could do anything to hurt me.
Squeeeeeee! *Oink* Squeeeeeee!
Go Fetch
Xantezza, God of Imps
*Firmly say that you&apos;ve made your choice.*
Marketplace 01
Willowed Death&apos;s Touch
Guess I know what I need to do now...
*The turtle barely glances at you as she moves slowly across the beach, making a slow, &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt; path towards the building by the docks.*
You picked a terrible place to get lost, friend. This isn&apos;t exactly a scenic spot...
I am Gratiana, priestess of Amadia. It is a privilege to welcome you to her sanctuary from Braccus&apos;s vile swamps.
I don&apos;t make exceptions.
She was human, light skin and fair hair, with a blue flower tucked behind one ear... but her eyes. I didn&apos;t know humans could have such dark eyes. They seemed almost &lt;i&gt;pure black&lt;/i&gt;.
I&apos;ve no idea what you are talking about! Now, will you be leaving my room under your own power or will I have to whistle up my guards?
Plain Belt
*Claim that you&apos;re an old acquaintance of Brannt - that&apos;s what brought you to Arx. You want to see if he&apos;s alright.*
*Barely have you touched the needle&apos;s pinpoint surface when it pierces your fingertip&apos;s bone marrow-deep.*
[BEAST] *Tell him &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ve &lt;/i&gt;been told not to talk to odd kids.*
*Ask why they&apos;re still here if they need to go to Driftwood.*
Who are you to her? Father? Son? Brother? Lover? If you&apos;re looking for revenge, you won&apos;t find it here.
Very well. You will carry your pain forever - and you will also carry a message.
Character&apos;s primary attributes increased.
Your faith serves you, brother! Hold it. Use it. &lt;i&gt;Feel it. &lt;/i&gt;I promise it is not in vain.
*Soothe the toy. Sh-sh-sh-sh. Relax. It&apos;s not you it wants.*
The Academy exists *kksskkt* to help unveil the Divine, from amongst the Godwoken.
Let&apos;s make this easy. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; assume you&apos;ve accepted my mission. &lt;i&gt;You&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; assume I give it in good faith. Beautiful.
Create an oil surface.
The spear of a dead elf... consecrated in his own blood.
*You see a party of nobles racing from the Voidwoken onslaught - among them, a comely lizard, scales of red. They don&apos;t run away from the consulate, but further inward.*
Until we meet again, Beast.
*Say that you&apos;re going to find her true name, and take your leave.*
Still, you&apos;d best keep that mask on. The living don&apos;t take kindly to seeing their future staring back at them.
Scoundrel Skillbook
Magisters told me to stand out front &apos;til they caught the Sourcerer, and I don&apos;t wanna upset them when they&apos;re on the warpath.
For the sake of the dwarves, Beast and Queen Justinia found common ground. Free of Isbeil&apos;s influence, she will return to the kingdom.
I don&apos;t know &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;I saw. Something&apos;s changed within me, but all may not be as it seems.
Animators Reference: Ladder
*Her jaw drops. She struggles to process the news.*
And don&apos;t you expect that to change, neither. You helped me out, but I don&apos;t owe you nothin. Lizard.
Shut your mouth, prisoner!
Damn fool should have kept his mouth shut.
Hmmm... You were in a cellar with other Sourcerers. As everyone lay sleeping, it seems you and another elf engaged in an action somewhat similar to the one I just performed.
What a pile of junk!
*His &lt;i&gt;pack?&lt;/i&gt; Ask about the Lone Wolves.*
*Rest your hand over your heart. You won&apos;t let her or her people come to harm.*
Don&apos;t drop your guard - we&apos;re not there just yet.
*Ask what&apos;s up here.*
Think about it. It&apos;s one of &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;who got killed. Not one of us. We want to find who did it and bring them to justice.
To Cave
The Queen and the Deathfog were dealt with. Arx is finally safe.
This is terrible, but the horror I witnessed in Fort Joy is this tragedy tenfold.
*Say you need a reminder. What were you looking for, again?*
*The spirit gives you the same smile - sweet, yet aloof.*
[LOHSE] *Stare at him wide-eyed. Say he&apos;s possessed, he must be!*
My mistakes will always burden my heart. But there is time for atonement.
You must come to me as soon as it&apos;s complete... it&apos;s quite something, and I&apos;m not easily impressed.
I&apos;m sorry, I mistook you for a different kind of person. My mistake. I shall return to serving my other customers, and I wish you a good if boring appetite.
At first, I figured I&apos;d just kill you, but then I thought, &apos;Isbeil. You&apos;re wasting an opportunity here!&apos;
Come. On.
Zweihander
A word of warning: he is like a shred of nightmare ripped from the dream realm, set loose in reality. Do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; underestimate this creature.
You&apos;ve been playing &lt;i&gt;pretend&lt;/i&gt; all your life! But the reality is quite, quite different.
*Reach into its spirit, searching for its memories.*
Ifan left my party.
So it is. But I&apos;ll acquiesce.
Whetstone
*Note that most people can barely hold their breaths for more than a few minutes.*
Ornate Book
The loss is all of ours.
Source-Infused Cellar Key
And every lizard could be a threat.
&lt;i&gt;Hahaha! &lt;/i&gt;I bet you will! &lt;i&gt;HAHAHA!&lt;/i&gt;
Water Barrel
But in this one? I&apos;ll walk no more by your side.
So, if I tell you a riddle and you can get the answer right, I&apos;ll give you a good discount. Deal?
The wolves&apos; Void Howl makes this creature stronger...
No... no... &lt;i&gt;NO!&lt;/i&gt; My fortune, my luck... you... you...
Bad news for our bovine friends, I suspect.
It&apos;s not much to look at, is it? The weapons I mean, not... well... um... Here, see for yourself.
Poor constructions with their tops unscrewed...
Windowed
Heh. I wonder what else is happening in Arx right under our noses?
Meteor Shower Scroll
In the Hall of Echoes, my god was on the brink. I must find the Council of Seven on the Nameless Isle. At the Well of Ascension, I&apos;ll become Divine.
*Tell him to shut up and fight - this creature won&apos;t discriminate between you.*
Buddy&apos;s Key
Procure a ripped-off face that can be used for shapeshifting.
Rat
We suspect that Dallis herself and her Master Vredeman are the inspiration for these dark endeavours. Look under the White veil of secrecy, and report back.
[SEBILLE] *As you stalk away, your elven eyes spot something strange on the barrels. Lean in to investigate.*
She never did like you.
*You&apos;re pretty sure this is going to backfire, but say that yes, you speak for the Advocate.*
*Blood seeps from Jonathan&apos;s wound and pools at Gareth&apos;s feet. He stares at the stream as it carves a path around his boots.*
&lt;i&gt;Bloody waste!&lt;/i&gt;
Run for it!
*She turns to you, dark-eyed and dirty-haired, and smiles flatly.*
*Tell her there&apos;s no time for distractions; we must remain focused.*
It&apos;s only a matter of time, you know? Outside Driftwood, not even the sharpest blades can protect us from those... things. Inside, a killer roams. One with a Magister grudge, it seems...
*She takes the invitation from you. Peruses it closely. Hands it back.*
Painting of the God King
[SCHOLAR] *Ask what the deal is with the mirrors.*
Someone&apos;s been causing a lot of damage around here. Don&apos;t suppose you know anything?
Stop right there, prisoner!
Little help here?!
Soon enough. Soon enough.
Missive to Dallis
Got sword and shield on hand!
You regret your crime for the rest of your life - or at least, for what&apos;s left of it!
*Waving you away, she cranes her neck to scan all around her, jaw clenched and eyes flickering.*
Of course the Magisters turned to the Black Ring. Dressing swineherds in red robes does not suddenly make them better people.
My wood is older than the sea you sail on. I will not yield. Speak the password.
No sooner had we fallen to our knees in reverence, than the ground shook, monsters howled for blood, and fires raged around us.
Quartermistress Anna
I&apos;m not a generous man. But... I could give you what you seek, if you offer something in return. A completely &lt;i&gt;fair&lt;/i&gt; exchange between Sourcerers.
