I&apos;d say &apos;your guess is as good as mine&apos;, &apos;cept I&apos;ve got the sense not to ask any questions. Now you slither on, lizard. I&apos;ve enough scales to deal with.
&lt;i&gt;Thought.&lt;/i&gt; That&apos;s rich.
*A single tear rolls down his cheek.*
Hrmm? Source?
Take care of yourself, Lohse.
*The bull shrugs.*
When entering Lucian&apos;s crypt, I discovered that Gareth had been purged - a tragic fate for a troubled Seeker.
*A warm hand grips your shoulder, and you turn to see... Tarlene&apos;s face. Smiling, hopeful. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Sisters in Lucian forever,&apos; &lt;/i&gt;she intones. You grin back. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Sisters in Lucian forever.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Roll your eyes and carry on.*
*Observe that the Magisters might be mad, but they&apos;re not the ones hiding in a barrel.*
Character is shocked by electricity.
Good. Then we can stay here forever.
Someone else gave Lohar proof of Mordus&apos; death.
Aye, that weren&apos;t my call. She&apos;s not suited to this.
Lizard Dreamer
You think you&apos;re being smooth, I bet. I&apos;m taking you to prison, where you belong.
All in good time, but alas time is at a premium. You must return to the mortal world.
You can feel it moving inside...
Come on! Last one - for the road!
Fitting but absurd. I will call you by the name you were given.
Evict the squatters.
*Tell her you&apos;ll look for Gwydian.*
Looks like the Order has dispensed with justice and turned to cruelty.
Still so much to do... &lt;i&gt;Still so much to do...!&lt;/i&gt;
You should probably come to terms with the fact that you&apos;ve half a mind full stop! You&apos;ll never attain the rank of slave with manners such as &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.
He&apos;s grace. I&apos;m gruel. I&apos;m toooo slowww to give him smooches. And he&apos;s sooooooo smoochable.
A priestess of the Elven Temple bade us seek the Elven Scion at the top of the tree.
I&apos;d rather hoped you&apos;d know the answer to that. It&apos;s your power to wield, after all. I have faith in you, for all your many manifest flaws!
Hidden Treasure
Divine Lucian, take my blood. Tell me I am pure...
*Say that if he&apos;s getting out, you want in.*
These images ([1] and [2]) are being synced by other player(s).
[ELF] *Tell him you will never forgive him for the genocide of your people.*
Lavender
*Cock an eyebrow. And she thinks you do know how to rule?*
*He tips his fingers to his forehead in thanks and turns to leave.*
Amadia&apos;s blessings, child. I pray the goddess keeps you in her grace. This is her shrine and her sanctuary.
The feast begins! Praise to the Devourer! Praise to the one who hungers in his name!&lt;br&gt;
You&apos;re lucky to stand in a town protected by Magister Reimond&apos;s wisdom. Without him the Voidwoken would have turned this slum into a charnel house. We pray he&apos;ll return soon.
*Declare that anyone talented enough to defeat a Voidwoken deserves to be called &apos;champion.&apos;*
Spirit of Zanisima
[1]% chance to shatter ice surfaces in an explosion of ice shards.
*Say that sounds... really rather horrifying.*
Bones are so boring. Without flesh, there&apos;s no memories to be had.
I don&apos;t think so.
I don&apos;t care what anyone says - the Divine deserves the benefit of the doubt. Nobody can claim to truly understand his actions.
*Rub the area where your belly once was. Remark that Driftwood was a place of great culinary wonders, and walk away.*
Can someone turn down the sun, please?
*Demand to know who this person is.*
*Say he was right to show compassion. Friendship trumps all else, even in war.*
Door To Eternity
It was a painful lesson on the dangers of the Godwoken. But... if the Mistake did not ascend, perhaps Divinity would indeed alight on the most deserving. I hope this is the case, hmm &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt;
*Smile and tell the entity it&apos;s out of its element.*
Explore the passage.
One of us ate Alexandar&apos;s head. We can no longer bring it to the Sallow Man.
I... I can tell you though.
Fine. Take it. Sorry, or whatever.
Every weapon in my stock has spilled blood in honour of the God King - if you can&apos;t do the same, then the fault lies with you.
Ah, my sun-baked friend. Any luck in old lady Surrey&apos;s tomb?
Oh, honey. I know this isn&apos;t the way you wanted it to end. But Anathema is still out there. And I&apos;m not keen on competition, if you get my drift.
I&apos;ve got neither the time nor the inclination to chat with you.
Tillya Snook
*Tell him you&apos;re keeping the parts. You wouldn&apos;t want him anywhere near a weapon that powerful.*
*Ask if she&apos;s going to be okay.*
*She takes you in and almost smiles.*
You? Read a book? Last night? While you were supposed to be guarding the rest of us sleeping?
*He looks you over with an assessing stare and crosses his bony arms.*
You have helped me to escape immediate danger, but I remain a fugitive from my old life, and... the promises I made to it...
An inspiration? We&apos;re an EXAMPLE!
A sour meal, no doubt. Garvan... Garvan... GARVAN did this...
*For a long moment he rings the bell... and then he stops. A tear appears at the corner of his eye.*
[Translate26_0f6ff4f8-634d-4efc-a4b3-5d0ad896d267]
You&apos;re a fool, you&apos;ll see! They&apos;ll get their hands on you and then...
*Call to her: Come back, Lohse. I can&apos;t lose you.*
When she knocked, we figured it must be time. The Order had come for me. But it wasn&apos;t a Magister who&apos;d called. Not then, anyway. It was a lizard. Not one red like you, mind.
I merely try to protect you from yourself. They&apos;ll own you before long, trust me.
Majesty, she awaits you...
I don&apos;t know... maybe this is a bad idea.
Your ability to channel Source has sadly already passed the limits of my means. Although let it not be said that I ever shirked my duty.
My soul is bound to your whim, blessed one. How may I serve you this day?
Void-Touched Livewood Fragments
Hey - it&apos;s Fran! Well I&apos;ll be. Now get up on my head, where yeh belong!
Something smells awful!
Get away from me... please!
*He howls with rage and scrabbles backwards, still unable to see you but certainly suffering under the force of your Source vampirism. With a last gasp, he disappears, leaving only an atmosphere of terror.*
They call you a slayer of giants. If you strike from the shadows as effectively as you strike in the light, you may find my supplies... invaluable.
*Pardon yourself and step back. You want to hear where this is going.*
Oh. You. I&apos;m very busy for the moment. So, ah. Bye.
You trying to make me trip, shorty?
Why are you still speaking? If there was a cave to explore, do you think I&apos;d tell &lt;i&gt;you?!&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, Lucian help us...
*Say nothing at all.*
As long as there is power, there is conflict. Source for all: it is but the dream of an idiot who will soon wake to find his wrists in shackles.
Toggle Info
Well. Take our leaflet. If you have any questions about Sourcerous Sundries, how about you turn to it instead of me? Great.
Didja *HNR!* Didja see it? The greenly bad tried to do - *HNR!* - bad things. But we escaped-away!
*Hold your breath against the insanity and consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
One of us angered the lizard courtesan and was turned away. Maybe another of us can try their luck...
Harm my mistress, and you&apos;ll live to regret it. Understand?
XXrr-jjxxrr Lu-cian?
You would ignore me? I suggest you try ignoring&lt;i&gt; this -&lt;/i&gt;
*Test the word in your mouth. Godwoken. You like the sound of it.*
Release the Knight&apos;s good spirit from his corrupted shell, Godwoken. Do this and I will gift you with the last standard of the original Seekers. If you seek ascension, it could help you greatly in the trials along the way.
You do tend to beat around the bush, don&apos;t you? Oh well, that wishy-washy answer will have to do then.
I considered her... but she only fights in the arena, and blood she spills there is fair game. No... something&apos;s not right... she&apos;s a poor fit...
*She steps forward, grabs you behind the neck with alarming strength and pulls you close. She sniffs twice, her nose at  your ear, then bites, piercing the lobe with a needle-sharp fang.*
Although it seems unlikely, given recent events.
Shoot a chilling shard of ice that deals [1].
Moving to noxious atmosphere enabler!
*Leave Jonathan to his guilt.*
Stick your sorrows in there-oh, &apos;n&apos; drown until they swim! Ha-hah! I tell ya, when I hear that ditty I&apos;m right back home with me mates at the tavern. Hoo!
My word! Something&apos;s breaking through!
*If you had guts they&apos;d be churning. Every act of horror Dallis committed... that was &lt;i&gt;your daughter?!*&lt;/i&gt;
Sockets
Welcome, my friend. I hope you take comfort in our sanctuary.
It&apos;s a curse. Or possibly a reorganisation of the string inside my brain. I&apos;m only able to tell the truth. And I can&apos;t stop telling the truth.
Add-ons
I know that you know this is true. You have given of yourself to me.
If you won&apos;t help... if you won&apos;t help... he&apos;s done for!
They&apos;d be daft to come back. And as long as there&apos;s no Sourcerers, there&apos;s no Voidwoken.
Blessed Electrified Water
*Rawrawrawr!*
Oh! I&apos;m sorry, madam, I didn&apos;t mean anything by it. I&apos;m just the demure yet sexy maid. I was in here clearing up and I saw these clothes... I couldn&apos;t resist! Please don&apos;t punish me!
*She returns to her humming.*
*Ask Swann for help - he must surely know what&apos;s best.*
*The cat curls up and snuggles into his squirrel friend, who quietly sits and sniffs on the deck.*
His Royal Highness the Red Prince is dead. His majesty is gone. His quest is over.
It has to be &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
*Sneer that for a prince, downfall and death are all too closely related. If he failed how will he make up for it?*
A seven-headed snake? That sounds scary!
[SCHOLAR] *Nitpick?! Declare that history is the foundation on which civilisation is built!*
I&apos;m glad we agree. With that, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll leave me to my ministrations.
Hold there, lizard! There&apos;s a Sourcerer somewhere in this worm-ridden dump. Have you seen him? Grey cloak? Grey beard? Satchel of books?
I would say &apos;good day&apos;, but it seems quite likely that you&apos;re about to die a rather terrible death, so...
*Be generous and say their afterlife is worth a mad king&apos;s ransom.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82])
I&apos;ve been doing nothing &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; waiting while Mordus kept himself alive and alert with &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; Source. Here... just &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; a book. Its wisdom might do you some good.
*Roll over and pull on your boots. Time to get back to the ship.*
What?
Urrgh... my head&apos;s spinning...
*Sharply chastise her for slaving away to the benefit of humans and the like - she should show more dignity.*
Speak, Godwoken, but be sharp. Time passes quickly.
I have no doubt you will do good by our realm. I can&apos;t wait to see it.
Huh? Yes! Fine. I&apos;m fine... I just - I&apos;m not sure - it&apos;s all a little foggy...
That&apos;s right!
*Say that the man he&apos;s searching for has escaped.*
Hmm... you&apos;re less robust than I&apos;d wish, Godwoken. You truly should have put more of an effort into developing your strength.
Please. Don&apos;t do this. Not - not in front of her.
ARGHHH!!
It tastes of nothing. I may as well be eating coal...
*Heave a sigh of frustration. She can consider the mood killed.*
Speak to her if you wish - she m-may know more.
I came by a new patient. A young woman. Very... troubled. I&apos;ll do what I can for her, but I&apos;ll need to concentrate, and that means...
