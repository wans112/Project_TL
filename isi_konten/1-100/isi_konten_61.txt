We found a map of Bloodmoon Island marked with hidden vaults, a forge, and some sort of archive.
What?! I trusted you to keep her &lt;i&gt;safe!&lt;/i&gt;
Your blood means nothing to me, lizard. Merit is what I value.
*Alert and focused, this spirit is not lost at all.*
*She produces a mirror of darkest black - it catches the light and holds your gaze. She looks into it as if to stare at her own magnificence... and then speaks, as if to herself.*
*You look up into dozens of eyes glittering in the dark. A long drip of saliva falls from the shadows. It isn&apos;t blood...*
Send feedback
No! You mustn&apos;t! Every memory ripped away, one by one... I am... I am... nooOOOO!&lt;br&gt;
You made the bad man go away. You did it. He can&apos;t hurt me now.
*Blackness. As your eyes grow accustomed to the dark, you first notice a glint on your readied dagger, then the pale skin of your mark.*
Of course it can&apos;t wait!
Huge Water Resistance Potion
*The child has a small mirror in his hands. He holds it up at angles, inspecting his eyes, his chin, the crown of his head. He spots you and his arms snap to his sides.*
*The cat gives the dog a long, languid look of carefully disguised contempt. Then she sighs. And turns to you.*
*Tell him his comrade sent you, you&apos;re looking for paid work.*
Unfortunate, isn&apos;t it? He isn&apos;t without talent, but he never overcame the fact that he was &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; son.
In time, the great city and its cathedral - Lucian&apos;s memorial -
Oh, come now. All your lies do is secure your passage to an early grave!
*The thick pus explodes into your mouth, coating the back of your throat. You can feel it running down your throat, like rancid custard.*
Keep out of reach of thirsty children.
So I have not misjudged you. Now... we&apos;ve established how you feel about power. How do you feel about... law? Specifically laws relating to property and... the acquisition of goods? Hmmm?
Madam! Those collars are not of IRON! Are you BLIND? Poor dear, not fit to shake my Source-infused claw. BOW to me! BOW to the most powerful Sourcerer on this isle!
The child is OURS! You will not save her!
Argh! Alright! Alright!
*Remark on the nearby elves. They seem unhappy, no?*
You, Fane, the Eternal Divine. What did you do with your power? What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
Help me break my... bond. I&apos;ll help you in return.
My head... I should&apos;ve known it was too good to be true...
Hall Of Echoes
Ifan&apos;s Theme Light
You do that and I&apos;ll point you to the wolves; let &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; sort you out. Deal?
*He shakes his head in disbelief.*
*Insist that she has nothing to lose and everything to gain. Panicking helps no-one.*
Gotta get to the Queen, then. This shite sure in the hell goes higher than Lohar.
Large Telekinesis Potion
Moving to orifice manipulator!
We broke Lord Arhu&apos;s spectral chains, causing him terrible pain.
I have no idea! I only arrived in town a few days ago. I sold a few items to Grandmaster Kemm in Arx and stopped off here on my way to Cyseal.
Bandit Dwarf Thug
Mordus has transformed into a Voidwoken.
The goods are mine. But you do not get away with this.
*As you draw in deeper and deeper breaths, you feel your tension dissipating. The anger slinks away, like a whipped cur. It will not shape you this day. If you are to make amends, you will need calculated moves more than rage.*
*KSSRT!*
Ssso, you are a sssellsssword. The Sssallow Man will want to ssspeak with you, to tell how you how to ssserve. Take thisss...
*Claim that you were conscripted by the Magisters on the surface, and sent down here to help with their efforts.*
Ruins - Castle Exterior
*Say you aren&apos;t surprised. You&apos;re used to being at the tip of people&apos;s tongues.*
The Gods appeared. Furious at the purging of the Wellspring, they demanded a sacrifice - Godwoken Source, to keep them alive.
*Apologise and backtrack. You&apos;ll help him if he&apos;ll help you.*
A deck of playing cards with illustrations of the royalty of Rivellon&apos;s history.
*You try to engage with him, but Fane&apos;s gaze never moves from his book.*
*Tell the dog you know he&apos;d die for his master. Ask him if his master would die for &lt;i&gt;him.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her she seems rather... casual about things.*
In a sense. The Lady - or the &lt;i&gt;Goddess &lt;/i&gt;Amadia as you know her - told me the Eternals were wiped out in a war with our King.
*A thin, grim man carefully sands the end of a beautiful, unpolished longbow. He studiously avoids looking up as you approach.*
This key belonged to Ryker. An aura of Source glimmers around it.
That... quite depends on &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, I suppose.
Used to be the lady&apos;s. Was there one daaaaaay and wasn&apos;t the nexxxxxxxxxt.
Oh, I promise you there&apos;s no subject more fascinating. I wouldn&apos;t have believed it myself, had I not seen them with my own eyes!
*Say that you hope he has something to offer you in return for what you shared.*
*Gasp...*
Don&apos;t you be impertinent, girl! The tables turning is not a victory, but a bitter stalemate at best!
I&apos;d bask in the sun; sleep nestled among bear cubs. Nothing out there would harm me.
Divinity is mine! Mine to share! Alas, the arch-demon would not allow my people to return. But I shall rule this world as best I can.
*You look up into her eyes, but she&apos;s already disappearing - melting away like fog in the morning sun. Soon there&apos;s nothing left.*
*The tree&apos;s spirit embraces its putrid host. An elven ancestor, lost to the same demonic disease that infects all of Bloodmoon Island.*
*You&apos;ve questions. He&apos;ll answer them before he dies.*
*Ask if fresh fish won&apos;t do instead.*
Let me think. A sprinkling of skulldust. A vial of dog&apos;s drool. Dried illweed. A few more odds and ends, and I can get back to the ship.
Oh, but &lt;i&gt;I do&lt;/i&gt; - I know a stubborn, Source-loving fool when I see one. Repent your ways... or the Void will take you.
[UNDEAD] *Say that more riches await the dead than do the living.*
Double Poison Grenade
*A presence accosts you. You cannot see it, yet know it is there. It is in front of you, then behind, then finally within.*
Aye... well, I&apos;m not advocating it. Besides, you wouldn&apos;t deny me if you knew what kind of a day I&apos;ve been having...
A mystery vault under the barracks, hey? Those Magisters are craftier than I thought...
I never thought I would become one of his victims. And yet, here I am...
*Insist: ask him what the incident was that made him run afoul of the law in the first place.*
Nikor of the Black Ring
Well, that was... terrifying. I need a new line of work. Goat-herd, high on a mountain. Spice trader in the deserts. Anything but this. They&apos;re looking for people to go to the Empire. How&apos;s it for Voidwoken there?
You are a male of one of the races; you are perceived as male by those that encounter you.
Carver
*Greet the spirit by name. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Eleanessa!&apos; &lt;/i&gt;You know her story. She is safe with you.*
Amethyst
*He licks his lips. Dry flesh turns wet.*
And justified it is too. You&apos;ll be a witness to wonders, I assure you.
Game Master Inventory
Lohar, eh? The boss had been getting messages from dwarves all over, but that is an... interesting one. &lt;br&gt;
Vampiric Touch
Then again, I suppose &apos;Desolate, Boring, and Covered in Fish Heads Coast&apos; doesn&apos;t quite roll off a tongue.
*Ask for the security question.*
Oh, do hold your prickly tongue!
Good to see you again. Marvellous ship you have here. Worthy of a king...
*She gazes into your eyes and sighs with relief.*
Same thing they wanted with all of us - using our Source powers to find ancient relics in the caves down the beach.
Sit, my friend. Come.
*A strange cold emanates from the log. The closer you get, the deeper the cold penetrates.*
Is there nothing that will end this curse?!
Key to a Safe
No hard feelings. Well. Maybe a &lt;i&gt;few&lt;/i&gt;. For now.
*Say that you want to know more about him, in order to put your mind at ease.*
Magister&apos;s Crossbow
*The skeleton looks back to the book. You can feel the grief radiating from him.*
The worksmanship on these supple leather trousers is particularly fastidious - every stitch perfectly spaced, every edge carefully reinforced.
*Draw your weapon and tell Grog that Marg sends his regards.*
*Point to the mutilated Paladin. Another &apos;thief&apos;?*
*Take your leave.*
Ship&apos;s inside a cove not too far from here. You&apos;ll have to get past that mouthy door of his, but if you&apos;re sick of the rising sun, Cap&apos;ll make sure you never see another.
Trousers of Talent
I just am. You can trust in me. I just am.
Laslor&apos;s Lute of Haste
Yes, terrible... let&apos;s see if they have anything of value.
Eternal Sarcophagus
To get past the statue of Lucian on the Path of Blood we need a Source amulet and the Scroll of Atonement.
&lt;b&gt;Claws of Deceit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I was a young girl, my mother always used the name of the Lone Wolves to strike fear into my heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Bed by eight,&lt;br&gt;Don’t be late,&lt;br&gt;When hoots the owl,&lt;br&gt;The wolves will prowl.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where other children from the upper parts of Arx played Magisters versus Black Ring, in our lowly district we only played a game called ‘Contract’: each taking turns to be the Lone Wolf hunting assassination targets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little was I to know that years later, I’d be plucked from those very streets by their leader: Roost Anlon himself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, I had fallen on hard times then. The hardest. I was but a scullery girl in the chambers of Lord Linder Kemm, forever trying to steer clear of his harridan wife Paulina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I met the handsome Roost - oh, so handsome! - one night as I dutifully scurried home from market with the fresh tea leaves Lady Paulina had ordered. Pay no heed to any other rumours you may have heard; it was at the market I met him and no mistake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sidled up to me, all bright teeth and cheekbones. By the time I found out he was a Lone Wolf, it was too late. He already had the keys to Kemm’s mansion, all the good silverware... and my heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, let me tell you how it all happened...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[All of the following pages were ripped from the book by a violent hand.]&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
Looks like Little Tommy Terror lost his apple knife.
They were at the mercy of the Seven, then the God King, and finally me. They deserved better than that.
I... you&apos;re right. I&apos;m sorry. My baby&apos;s been missing for days now, and no-one here will lift a finger to help me find her. Erma&apos;s her name.
*Ask to see her stock.*
If it isn&apos;t the wayward son. How can I assist, your &lt;i&gt;honourliness?&lt;/i&gt;
Wherever it is, it&apos;ll probably make Fort Joy look like a picnic.
*The Doctor looks at you in shock. The word seems to hurt him. He hisses in anger...*
There must be &lt;i&gt;something &lt;/i&gt;around here...
I fight too, to begin. But soon you see . You are the first of many -
Hovering Rune
Hear that? It did something...
Welcome back. Care to shop?
*Growls...* &lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;
Are you simple? Why, I painted &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian&lt;/i&gt; - the greatest series of paintings to ever come out of Arx!
*CAWKCAWKRICAW!*
None... he set out to find those Source weapons, and... and that&apos;s the last we saw of him...
*Say combat has been terrible so far.*
[OUTLAW] *Whatever substance she&apos;s on, ask if she has any to spare.*
