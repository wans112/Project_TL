You assume it is a peaceful treatise on war psychology until you find a small sheet of paper hidden within, which details how to make a grenade that can strike terror into the hearts of your adversaries. Unfortunately, it seems to require &apos;one tormented soul&apos;...

*Ryker&apos;s voice grows even louder, drowning your words in a deluge of his own.*

Yes. I rather liked that. I was trying to kill Isbeil. But she was already dead.
That must have been the sound we heard, and what caused the surge of water...

But there&apos;s always room for improvement, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree. My, eh, condition limits what I can do for you, but I&apos;m sure I can manage one final lesson.

*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Adramahlihk&apos;s voice has gone silent. But I&apos;m afraid my recovery will take a touch of time. I am well past my prime, you know.
Beneath the ransacked barracks, we found the White Magisters&apos; secret vault. Dallis&apos; trail led to the Cathedral and Lucian&apos;s tomb.
Walk on, little boy.

It does not respond to my touch. There must be a way to activate it...
A five letter word is carved deep into the metal: POWER
You&apos;d turn milk green and a Magister&apos;s red coat black. My mistress Alice might fancy you though. She has a taste for the odd. If she ever makes it back. Grbbt.
