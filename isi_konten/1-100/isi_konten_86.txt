So close your sweet eyes and rest your wee head...
*Before you&apos;ve even registered the cool flesh, the vines lash around your wrist and drag you close.*
The half-demon Malady took pity on the soulless Godwoken silent monks, and brought them to the Hall of Echoes. There, from the scraps of their souls that remained, she restored them to life. Sourcerers no more, they lived out the rest of their lives, freed of the burden of being the Godwoken. Freed from the weight of the world.
*Take it.*
*A nonchalant snap of the fingers, and just like that you&apos;re back in the land of the living.*
Zapor&apos;s Second Mate
So tell me! Tell me your tale!
*He gasps in shock as the knife pushes through flesh, muscle, chips a rib, and enters his beating heart. He falls forward, clutching at you.*
Yes - the Void closes in. It&apos;s so much more dangerous than even Deathfog. Deathfog, we can see and smell. The Void is empty, intangible. We don&apos;t know it&apos;s there until its creatures are upon us.
Merits a word doesn&apos;t it? After all, only one of us can become the new Divine...
*You&apos;re not so certain after all. This is all going rather quickly.*
Isbeil, an agent of the God King, has been manipulating Queen Justinia into using Deathfog on Arx.
*The figure turns towards you - and you recognise what&apos;s left of his face. &lt;i&gt;The Sallow Man. &lt;/i&gt;He snarls in agony and rage - and you feel his mind reach out to yours, searching for a way in.*
I have an even greater challenge for you! Beyond lies an eternal construct of great destructive force.
*Rush forward and try to help him up.*
Alright kids, it&apos;s time you heard the truth... so here&apos;s the thing: Joe was eaten by a shark.

*Kiss the jewel on his head and take your leave. You have a future to look forward to.*

I guess you should go tell Magister Carver - who&apos;s &lt;i&gt;on duty&lt;/i&gt; - and leave &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;alone.
The elven seer? Her heart bled, she said. A millenium of memories warned against a pogrom, she said. She would not assist the great Alexandar.
A good wolf doesn&apos;t take out the competition until there&apos;s no other option. Let&apos;s hunt together. For now.
But listen here, I&apos;m a bit bored with all this chit-chat.
Perhaps you can enlighten a small matter for me, Sourcerer. Tell me, what&apos;s the talk in the camp about our cure?
*Push your finger into the wound and twist it open.*
*Gareth massages his forehead and grunts.*
Please... it hurts...
I admit, this seems highly unusual. But I need the money. Now get out of here, or people will talk.
You&apos;re at the beginning of a long journey, Godwoken. Long, but &lt;i&gt;exceedingly &lt;/i&gt;interesting.

Even immortals are not immune to a brutal death.
*The device is inert. It does not respond to your touch.*

I&apos;m not falling for that one again!
Oh stop, you...! It was &lt;i&gt;five,&lt;/i&gt; after all.
Please - someone, stop this madness! Let her go!
Heart of Steel

*You are Lennard Rawl. Godwoken. Thief. If you can&apos;t earn a place in Lucian&apos;s shadow, you&apos;re going to steal it. You think you&apos;ll find advantage in the Forbidden Library.*

Arhu&apos;s Lockbox Key
[OUTLAW] *Tell her you&apos;re just like she is - an outsider, a lost one, a dweller of the shadows.*
The tree spirit Eleanessa&apos;s demon now possesses her doctor. Adramahlihk, she says, has left Bloodmoon Island.
Ritual Bowl
Congratulations, you are truly a master sleuth. But perhaps you should take a break from detective work and earn a little coin?
Imperial Guard
*Remark that their plan means there shall be no true Divine.*
Medusa&apos;s Head
Aegis
*Ask who the lizard insulted.*
I fear this is so, but the blame is not mine alone. Once we seven stood united. Now...
I knew. All runaways around here.
That&apos;s it, then? Let&apos;s do it!
Handmade Scale Armour
And you, the Red Prince, the Lizard Divine. What did you do with your power? What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
The Mother is dead and we are free of her terrible plan.
Just when I think I hear it all, you go and serve up that ridiculous story.
*What&apos;s going on? Is he... &lt;i&gt;afraid?*&lt;/i&gt;
Ah. Kind of you to drop in. Now, if you&apos;ll kindly send for Lohse, we can continue this conversation.
Report back to me as soon as you&apos;ve investigated the kitchen - whoever works there must be involved!
N
Nucks
Gosh. You&apos;re being so mean. I really hoped we could be friends!
She trekked far underground beneath a nearby tower, seeking ingredients for her vile potions.
[RED PRINCE] *Solemnly swear - lizard to dragon - that you will do all you can to release him.*
The Godwoken were alive â€”
Oh, and Lohse? That pretty little one you think of at night? Kill &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; now and be done with it...
*He leans into you and kisses you passionately, his forked tongue probing...*
*Tell the kid to keep to himself, then.*
The dwarf in the vault claimed not to be possessed. He asked us to destroy the pillars and free him.
*Shrug and do as she says.*
No such thing for those who scar themselves for the God King.
Not like her to be late.
*The candles waver and shine with the spirits of those trapped inside, awaiting Lohse&apos;s decision.*
Halt! The hounds smell Source on you - plenty of it, by the sound of &apos;em.

&lt;i&gt;You only bring yourself pain. I will end it.&lt;/i&gt;
*What the hell, kill him anyway.*
Large Hammer
&lt;i&gt;Can&apos;t you take a hint? Leave me alone.&lt;/i&gt;
*You see billows of golden sand stretching beyond the whorls and whirls that roll across the portal&apos;s surface. It isn&apos;t clear if the portal allows return travel - but you&apos;re inclined to doubt it.*
Ah, arrogance, that most peculiar of human traits, given your lack of cultural accomplishment, save the towers you erect in worship of greed. &lt;i&gt;What riches do you seek, human?&lt;/i&gt;
You feel it, don&apos;t you?&lt;br&gt;
*Smile. Rub your belly. Remark that Driftwood was a place of great culinary wonders. Then turn and walk away.*
&lt;i&gt;The last age has ended, the sun all but rended; unto you all worship shall be.&lt;/i&gt;
Repair
*His cruel, scraping, booming laughter echoes away inside your mind. You realise that he&apos;s laughing at your imminent death - from which there&apos;ll be no return.*
It&apos;s hard not to feel some pride in reptilian engineering.
[SEBILLE] *Smile sweetly, then ask what happens when the chest is opened.*
Reckon not. That&apos;s alright though, innit. Don&apos;t need too many ties in a place like this.
Persuasion
Some people live hand to mouth. But it&apos;s really not advisable with this one.
It&apos;s time I levelled with you. This is the hand-grip of the fabled Anathema. A sword capable of annihilating anyone. Even a &lt;i&gt;Divine.&lt;/i&gt;
The gods may now claim these fallen souls. Farewell.
*The &apos;Seven usurpers&apos; - ask if that means the Seven gods.*
&apos;North - City Square&lt;br&gt;West - Kemm Mansion&lt;br&gt;South - City Gate&lt;br&gt;East - The School District&apos;
*Your mind races. Could this be true? Could it have been &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; who brought death and destruction to the elves? All those lives... who would set you up like that? Not... Lucian? No, Lucian couldn&apos;t... &lt;i&gt;wouldn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;...*
Alright. You&apos;re weird.
Sawdust and wolves, Mother. Sawdust and wolves.
They&apos;ll love to hear this.
With power spread equally throughout the world,

I scratched the Master&apos;s name from my arm.
&apos;The Mortall Remain&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; of Jon Corkran.&apos;
A slaughter... what happened to them?
Speak to the skeleton with sartorial sense.
A magical bomb was attached to this character and will go off when the status expires...
*As you bring your blade down the dwarf spins, his eyes turning deep, oily black. Your blade glances off his armour, leaving a long gash down his face.*
*Sniff the air for danger; are the Voidwoken still here?*
What kind of a monster gives you that power, only to strip it from you? To promise you will be &apos;the light of the world&apos;, and then cast you into darkness?
*Smile at the thought. Given everything you&apos;ve seen, you think they&apos;ll do the right thing.*
&lt;i&gt;tell me who you are dead one or I will take your unlife and do not doubt me for I tell the truth&lt;/i&gt;
*He scans the horizon for threats with one green eye, then nods back at you.*
*There is a blinding flash and you are surrounded by flame. It licks your skin, but does not burn. It dances in your hair, but does not singe. You feel a curious peace.*
*Say that you&apos;ve bested plenty of puzzles in your time - you&apos;ll figure out a way past his, same as the others.*
Jungle Frog
*Fane grabs your hand and enthusiastically pulls you behind the screen...*
Vest of Wonder
*Very well. Tell him he has your permission.*
*About the hooded conspirator: Who is this slave of theirs?*
Let&apos;s just say that you don&apos;t build a long-term business without learning to negotiate the... *ahem*... changing winds of the prevailing... climate. I&apos;ve weathered much in my time.
Second time&apos;s a charm? Or have I asked too much of you?
Oh? Well I would hardly want to get in the way of you having a little chat. Please, don&apos;t let my existential needs stop you.

Calocera Seedling
I was the &lt;i&gt;High Cryptographer&lt;/i&gt; for the entire Magister order - do you think I rose to that position by spilling the secrets of my trade to the first who asked...? No...
Instructions for crafting a scythe known as the &apos;Swornbreaker&apos;.
Each of the races were crafted not just in the image of their Gods but in their temperament too.
*Tell it you&apos;ve come a long way, you&apos;re not leaving yet.*
Sir!
It may be hard for you to understand. But my kind... we dream for the greater good. What we see can predict the truth, can even shape the truth. But we need drudanae to do it.
&apos;Here lies the body of Ryonna Lee,&lt;br&gt;Drowned in the flood of &apos;83.&lt;br&gt;A passing drifter tried to save her.&lt;br&gt;And himself was dragged under.&apos;
I don&apos;t know anything about this place! Nor do I know anything about a blood rose or a witch or some dead people.
Unless cooked by a wizard of a chef, this regional speciality could make even the devout lose their faith in the Seven.
Yes, she did. And I shall not allow mistakes to cost any more Paladin lives.

Easy now - we&apos;re not looking for trouble... not that kind anyway.

It is a promise that you cannot break, unless you want to end up broken yourself. Those who are Sworn to it are bound to the God King, come victory or defeat. If you try to break the Covenant unprepared, then you are sealing your own fate.
