There&apos;s got to be some clue. Dallis would&apos;ve trusted someone with the secret, wouldn&apos;t she? Unless there&apos;s someone still inside...
The Mother Tree asked us to track down the Shadow Prince.
You... It is you... I have found you... The Beast... the animal...  the failure...
*Sigh. If it means that much to him, sure, he can ask her about his dreams...*
All done, then?
*Bored... While untold millions would trade places with him in a heartbeat.*
Contrary to what you thought this book would be about, it&apos;s more of a political pamphlet against all authority or hierarchical organisation, where the author uses the well-known firestorm grenade as a symbol for the burning desire of the agitators that use it. The book itself is, like its simile, is a highly amateur affair. Fortunately, at the back of the book, there&apos;s a very detailed illustration of a firestorm grenade, along with an exact list of ingredients...
Brave lass, waltzing in here now.
Pretty colours. So nice. Until that ugly dwarf dropped an urn on my head...
*Say that you were just communing with the goddess. Obviously...*
Radius: [1]&lt;br&gt;Fire, Earth, Air and Water resistances get a 20% penalty.
You oughta. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the last you&apos;ll be seein&apos; of him. There are those of us who believe he&apos;s the key to ending all this mess. The Order. The Voidwoken. All of it.
*The God shifts shape again, contorting into a snake. Grimacing, you reach out your hand and Vrogir sinks his fangs deep into your palm.*
*Ask her what in the world she&apos;s doing.*
&lt;i&gt;Feedback.&lt;/i&gt;
Slug Rush
Everything&apos;s spick-and-span... Nothing left to do, really.
Glad to hear it!
[IFAN] *Tell Han you&apos;ve got an errand to run out in the Swamps.*
*The trader looks at the mansion behind her nervously, then back to you.*
Aye, so it is! But not just &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; drudanae, oh no: my own special blends.
A vial of blood labelled &apos;Ifan ben-Mezd&apos;

Please... noo...
Interesting. It may still be in working order.
If you make it, ring the bell outside. And tell Bahara I sent you. She&apos;s not quick to trust strangers.
Place an item over the pit to stop the puddle or cloud from spreading!
It turns out it was that of Brahmos the Wanderer, the greatest and most elusive dreamer of them all.
&apos;Here lies Debrah Forde.&lt;br&gt;Victim of sororicide.&lt;br&gt;No gentler soul has graced this plane.&lt;br&gt;Except for perhaps her sister Ellah.&apos;
*Tell Fane that you appreciate him standing by you. It can&apos;t have been easy to turn down the Voidwoken&apos;s offer.*
You need to be taught a lesson. Help! Over here!
We are done here.
The Shadow Prince sang Sebille&apos;s scar-song, but we were able to counter him. She did not lose herself to him.
Freed from the weight of the world.
In the beginning was the Source...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Here the historian Huwbert relates the history of Source: the pure energy that constitutes the create raw material of all life - the power that opposes the destruction and nothingness of the Void, bringing balance to the planes... and power to the Gods.]

But I need &apos;em. So yummy. They taste like shadows and spoilt cream, and turn the air dark. It feels so beautiful against my fur. Like being caressed by black cotton.
I find the stolen goods the hard way!
*Eyes closed, she repeats the same phrase over and over...*
*Turn your back. There is no way you&apos;re getting involved.*
We are all right. We are finally all right.
We gave Gareth Jonathan&apos;s ring. Still grieving, he left Paradise Downs, destination unknown.

Old Note
I hope everything is to your utmost satisfaction, milady.
*Lay your hand upon her cheek.*
Iron Body Armour
Liberty or death: he has both now, and he&apos;s the better off for it.
*Lean in close - you were hoping for something a little more, hmm, &lt;i&gt;Eternal.*&lt;/i&gt;
Hail. Such a striking man.
I&apos;ve no reason to strike you down. See that you don&apos;t give me one.
Looks like I caught me the thief I was looking for!
*Take the cloth and hold it tight to the wound to try and stem the bleeding.*
*Say no-one mentioned having to pay to stay here.*
Looks like my patient is on the mend - nothing short of a bloody miracle. Now I can get back to the rest of my work. If you need healing or want to trade, then come to me.
Bloody Reds! Bloody, buggering, bastardly Reds! But you ain&apos;t to blame, lad, I know that! You tried, and that&apos;s more than I did. Damn shame though. Damn shame.
You kill for the last time!
*Sigh.* I am relieved to hear it. You have my thanks, and you shall have my help.
Audrey... *Sob.* Why...?
You&apos;ve met a few demons these past few weeks, yes? You might have noticed they&apos;re pretty resilient.
*Ignore the throbbing in your skull and quickly explain what happened - your God hiding within you, your new power, and the Masters of Source.*
On yer way, then.
*Say you&apos;ll give it to him if he leaves you every bit of the armour.*&lt;br&gt;
*Ask if he intends to sleep away his entire stay here.*
*Attack the Magisters.*
My dear prince, I&apos;m sure this is true. But I believe one of your kin is even more talented than your good self, and for an insignifcantly small sum, I can make the introductions. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
When the God King brings the forest tigers back and we rise to rule,&lt;i&gt; you &lt;/i&gt;shall be the first to die, dog-man. After we&apos;re finished playing with you. Perhaps we shall hunt you in the forest before you die.
*The heart of the Mother Tree withers and dies. All falls silent and still.*
[LOHSE] *Land the final blow. It&apos;s better this way.*
Let me think... - no.
*Ask if Gareth is doing alright.*
*Beg his pardon. You&apos;d like to be on your way.*
It chokes. Can&apos;t breath. Can&apos;t speak. Can&apos;t run. Can&apos;t get free.
You have to admire their flexibility, if not their morality.
*Shake your head. You&apos;ve never heard his tale.*
&lt;i&gt;...aaaand&lt;/i&gt; you.
Immolated
*Heat envelops you from head to toe as a guttural voice rumbles in your ear. It snuffs out the memory with its first breath.*
My, my, how you positively brim with Source. No wonder, after all the adventures you have had; all the things you&apos;ve had to do...
*You run your hands along the exterior until your fingers graze the button noted in the schematic.*
*Gingerly approach and ask what torment he has suffered.*
*He gives you a long look. Unblinking, his breathing steady. His tongue protrudes from between his lips. He inhales deeply. Then suddenly he reaches for his weapon and yells...*
Apparently not. All the more reason to find out what it is and get it out.
Beware of splinters! These small chips and scraps of wood are more pernicious than a single log. Soften them up to avoid injury.
You&apos;re too kind.
So &lt;i&gt;that&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;where you got off to!

*Ask Swann to help keep her steady.*
*Tell her you don&apos;t want to play.*
The chef? What tripe - that waif can barely carve a ham.
...&lt;i&gt;the Doctor. &lt;/i&gt;He did this to me... but he&apos;s no more - I can feel his presence has extinguished. I am free.
*Meanwhile, the Red Prince gently cups Sadha&apos;s face in his hands.*
Between haves and have-nots alike, dwarves are fiercely nationalistic. Even the poorest dwarf would die for their dwindling Kingdom. But not all would die for the Queen...
But I am Duna. I am your god. You must avenge our people against that which would seek to destroy us.
*Sneer that the gods haven&apos;t been much help so far. Their island is overrun with Black Ring!*
All this is thanks to you, you know. If we hadn&apos;t found out what the Whites were doing in the Blackpits we wouldn&apos;t have known that they had to be stopped. I am in your debt.
*Giggle* Really? She told you to meet her in Arx? Mentioned the two of you had a special connection, right?
*Ask how she survives, if this place is so inaccessible?*
*The spirit smiles, then vanishes like a shadow chased away by the sun.*
Crit Chance
Good... now listen closely. Clear anything that will impede Mihaly - flames, those accursed fumes, anything. Come back here when there&apos;s a safe route, and we will follow you.
You&apos;re as likely to be innocent as I am to be Damian reincarnated. You&apos;re under arrest!
Tavern - Interior A
*The door does not open. But it feels... alive. It feels like it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;examining &lt;/i&gt;you. Or, at least, one of you. The door is examining &lt;i&gt;Lohse.*&lt;/i&gt;
And believe me, you don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to go in there. There&apos;s a bunch of Silent Monks inside who&apos;ve tasted blood today. Already killed in there, so they did.
Hard to see how.
No. &lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt; Lucian would never... never...
&lt;i&gt;*Thud. Thud. Thud. &lt;/i&gt;Your heart beats faster. The light grows bright. You&apos;re nearly there.*
*Remark that he shows remarkable trust in Almira - isn&apos;t he afraid that she might enthrall him?*
Either way, we need to get moving.
The Council Academy
Closet
I am blessed, limb-licker. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
*Note that Gwydian&apos;s not here. Where&apos;s he gone to?*
Yeah, yeah yeah. This is what I&apos;m talking about. Look. No-one likes rancid pork fat.
I&apos;ll not forget this.
[There is but one word hastily scribbled on this scrap of paper: Godwoken.]
Traitor!
But you know Lone Wolves are a large network of mercenaries, right? On contracts we work pretty independently. You know... &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;.
Yes, my chosen! I, the goddess, I who created you, tremble!
That would warm the cockles of my sternum, if you hadn&apos;t already pledged yourself to another.
*The shark lays there gasping quietly in the sunshine. Blood bubbles at its mouth. You leave it to die and turn away.*
Kemm&apos;s Gardens
To proceed while missing a member of this group seems unwise...
Without him... I was left with only the worst within me.
*Say you&apos;re happy to see them reunited.*
Air Resistance
You and me both, sister.
*Tell him you&apos;re an elf of the world, always looking to explore the many hidden delights of this existence.*
*With a quiet click, the lid of the chest swings open.*
You&apos;re going to Fort Joy to be cured of your nasty smelly lizard Sourcery!
You? Join our crew? Please. You&apos;re only fit to bait our hooks.

Deactivated
*&apos;Smelly&apos; person? Ask who that could be.*
*The woman is frozen stiff. Her face is fixed in an expression of alarm.*
Damage is based on your current Physical Armour.
Too much. Too much. Can&apos;t smell. Can&apos;t breathe...
Rivellon was purged of Source, but I did not submit to Lucian.
Are you sure you&apos;re finished with character creation? You have not selected any tags for your character.
Refreshed and refilled! You won&apos;t need to worry about your precious innocents anymore. Join me at my reliquary. I will take my soul. You will take what remains.
Then... why don&apos;t I take &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;turn.
*The spirit looks to the floor and stiffens, as quiet as empty space.*
Your soul must grow bigger still; your inner self become a vaster expanse so that it may house divinity.
