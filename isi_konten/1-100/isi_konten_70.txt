They likely do not even know what they hold in their hands. They do not know its corrupting effects. Braccus was a powerful king once.
You&apos;re a finer healer than I&apos;ll ever be, Sourcerer. Thank you...
*Exhale sharply and say perhaps she should have another drink.*
Valuable Necklace
Debuff Strength Potion
*Beast gives you an inquisitive look.*
*Roost smiles a soulless smile and gazes straight into your eyes.*
I know you do, despite what your body tells me.
I&apos;m free! I&apos;m free, I&apos;m free, I&apos;m free, oh &lt;i&gt;thank you...&lt;/i&gt;
The Watcher&apos;s Amulet
There&apos;s only one thing the likes of you understand. It&apos;s high time you learned some respect!
We never rose from that feasting table. He poisoned us - he &lt;i&gt;murdered &lt;/i&gt;his own mentors. I cannot fathom why - the Divine answers only to the Divine.
*He smirks as he raises his tree-trunk sized arms overhead and lunges for you. Somehow, you get the feeling that you&apos;re actually giving him what he really wanted all along.*
In the meantime, your next stop will be Magister William. All passengers have to be registered in the ship&apos;s manifest, and he&apos;s the chap in charge of the logs.
A Voidwoken! I&apos;ll strike it down, or die trying!
Gnarled and twisted greyish wood. Very long, but hard and wieldy. It just needs that one little extra thing to make it really useful.
Give her the Swornbreaker. Perhaps she was a threat before - but no longer.&lt;br&gt;
*Ask her to remind you where you can find Gareth and Braccus&apos; weapons.*
These skulls crumble to dust after one use.
*Play along and say how right she is; you must have been mistaken.*
You tease...
[LIZARD] *Tell him you&apos;d defend Zorl-Stissa to your dying breath - as should he.*
If any of your party members have an &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;item you need&lt;/font&gt; to progress, it will automatically be transferred from their inventory to yours.
*He nods, but the shame pricks him... yet, he still can&apos;t look you in the eye.*
*Say you&apos;ve come to stop this savagery.*
What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
Throw a cursed fire grenade into the air. It will explode there and bring down cursed mayhem unto all, dealing [1] or creating cursed fire surfaces in a [2] radius.
Greetings to you, my prince. We have some small... matters... to be discussed...
*The executioner&apos;s blade drops with a sickening thud, and his eyes turn to the remaining victims.*
And one thing is certain: &lt;i&gt;it won&apos;t be you.&lt;/i&gt; We fought side by side, yes, but we both knew our hearts weren&apos;t in it. Frankly I just don&apos;t respect you.
*The spirit sings a long forgotten tune in a long forgotten language, one it seems with the ever revolving wheels of space and time.*
What are you doing? They&apos;re close. I can feel them.
A muddy gem you found on a Voidwoken creature.
*Nod. You&apos;ll do as he asks.*
[VILLAIN] *Draw yourself up to your full height. Put on your most angelic face. Solemnly swear that, so help you Lucian, you have never killed so much as a fly!*
&lt;i&gt;...you are not chosen...&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m the only thing standing between this bridge and the Void!
You never hold me again!
*The spirit looks crestfallen. He seems to have even forgotten the supposed pain of his mortal wound.*
Hrm. Pick at one lie, and before you know it you&apos;ll find six more. I&apos;ll expect to have some questions for the gods, if they ever emerge from whatever hole they&apos;ve ducked into.
Don&apos;t touch the-... Don&apos;t touch the chest.
[LOHSE] *Do as she asks. Meeting a god sounds pretty fun.*
All that&apos;s twisted, all that&apos;s profane, all that&apos;s immeasurably cruel has been touched by Braccus&apos; withered hands!
*Ask where she came by these... unusual wares.*
Decide what to do with the explosive Higba.
Hah. You&apos;re funny.
Harbinger&apos;s Forgiveness
But be careful. One of &apos;em looked very much like Magister Reimond. You may have heard of him. You will not have heard good things.
Flasher Special Brew
I serve all who seek aid, ma&apos;am.
Captive Deep-dweller
*Hiss.* It is you. Saheila says you hurt the Mother. I say you walk on. I say you walk on, or I kill you.
Magister
*The Source fades from the amulet, consumed by the inner mechanisms of the button.*
Seagull
Voidwoken, ya mean? Poor thing. No wonder you were scared. I&apos;d be scared, too.
Nothing unusual here. Looks like I am wrong about you!
*Ask if they &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;believe that.*
We set sail for Arx.
&lt;i&gt; . . . n o . . .&lt;/i&gt;
*Argue that the Gods may have been his folk, but the Divine has always been a mortal.*
We encountered some Magisters. We convinced them to let us pass.
*Tell him you don&apos;t understand. Why would he massacre Seekers?*
I have not read that story. And until I have seen it for myself, I still hold out hope.
You pay for that! Help, thief!
My my, look at those tempests that are your eyes! I imagine you&apos;ve something like revenge on your mind; delusions of &apos;just restitution&apos;.
The queen is now free of the Black Ring&apos;s thrall. Leave her be; she&apos;s not a threat.
I&apos;m not so easily tricked. Over here! Criminal!
[FANE] *Assume a persona: Say your name is Magister... Mortle.*
There&apos;s a dwarven wedding today at the home of the merchant Micheil Ros.
*Purse your lips. The Queen will yet lead the Kingdom to its deserved majesty.*
Looks like someone&apos;s hit the Hall of Echoes a little early.
*His eyes flick wide open. But he&apos;s clearly asleep.*
&lt;i&gt;Spooky?&lt;/i&gt; Pull yourself together, man! Or should I check the cupboards for ogres?
There- there was something in the ground... Back in the cave, they-
As I thought. Blood even colder than those scales would imply.
*Share the news of Kemm&apos;s allegiance to the God King.*
Yes, Magisters - filthy, murdering pigs. Pigs eat anything, even each other. Then, when the time is right, they&apos;re slaughtered and fed to more pigs in turn. It&apos;s how it should be.
The Mother is everything to elves. She is the Mother of elvendom. But she loves the world. To see the world hurt would... pain her.
The world is too dark. But now we have hope again. We can bring back the light!
Quick-witted
Enemies will prefer to attack targets who are Taunting them. Cured by Clear-Minded, Enraged.
*Ask why she&apos;s calling you &apos;child&apos;? She may be a lord, but you&apos;re no infant.*
Go? There is no go. I belong here. I was Godwoken, but for all the evil in the world, I would not be Divine. I did not search the world for the others of our kind. My place is here. Yours is inside the mountain.
*She squeezes her supple lips into a narrow strip.*
Magical wonders are just within your grasp, elf!
*The boy beams like the summer sun. He reminds you of the Empire&apos;s youngest - new sprouts budding into warriors, barristers, dreamers.*
Electrifies and Blinds a nearby target. Deals [2] damage.
No, I most certainly do not feel the need to return the compliment!
Learn about the creature.
What&apos;s your name?
Warden
[RED PRINCE] *Command the kin to disobey. She stands above the petty laws of slave folk!*
Left Shift
*The spirit&apos;s gaze locks to the nearby candle. She roars in resistance, but her focus is no match for your hunger.*
Of course, you&apos;re not the only one.
The Vulture&apos;s Talons
*He looks to his slain brother&apos;s body, then to his sister&apos;s. His eyes well with tears, though none break free.*
Zombie Die
*Tell her Griff was a junkie. And she let him teach school?*
Stayin&apos; out of trouble, aren&apos;t ya?
*Turn away.*
And the house?
*Say yes of course. Who hasn&apos;t?*
You&apos;ve been warned! Few who displease Her Royal Highness live to make amends...
This ring was crafted in the Ancient Empire.
Deck of Cards
*The black glass of the mirror reflects nothing but your own image. The mirror is dead.*
Look out for more blackroot.
Free Amyro by force.
A no-nonsense manual on how to enhance your items using Sourcerous Sundries.
The feeling&apos;s not quite mutual.
Tolemy
I&apos;ll... serve my people as best I can. I am theirs now, and they are mine.
*Nod in farewell. His spirit is free of its worldly concerns.*
Blood to blood. Earth to earth. Wood to wood. Birth to birth.
[JESTER] *Adopt a commanding tone and proclaim that you, Duna, have answered her call. What does she want?*
Shadow Assassin
But I must say, your posture betrays your guilt.
Yes! Amadia is the Goddess of wizards. I&apos;ve prayed to her about this piggy fate, but she&apos;s not providing any solutions. I might have more luck at a shrine.
*The Sallow blood within the meat was corrupted long before his death; it makes you sick... and then Sallow&apos;s memories are gone.*
*The episode passes. Ryker is peering at you intently; he awaits your reply.*
To the death, prince...
&lt;i&gt;...would you like to?&lt;/i&gt;
Even dead, there&apos;re humans causing me trouble. You need something?
*The feeling of pressure in your hands recedes. The thing has released you, at least for now.*
Bow
Um, um, &apos;scuse me, um, Mister Piratey Man... have you seen our ball?
Braccus would have made me a supplicant, a slave to these walls. With your help, I&apos;ll die - at last! - with dignity.
*She folds a powerful hand over yours upon the spear and squeezes as tightly as she can, and when she speaks it&apos;s in a whisper, intended, you think, for your ears and yours alone.*
Please, forgive him. He&apos;s broken up. It&apos;s a lot to take in. We lost so much in the blink of an eye...
*The song continues. Sebille&apos;s eyes grow dull. She&apos;s completely under the lizard&apos;s thrall once more, lost to you forever.*
Trade: Bartering, Identifying &amp; Repairing
You&apos;ve come this far, and still remain ignorant? You&apos;re always so rash, Marcus. It&apos;s what got your little rebellion squashed. It&apos;s what got you shipped to the Isle of Mists. And it&apos;s what has you standing before me now, without a clue, without a plan.
Here she is. Here she &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.
Paladins! Search every book, drawer, and godsdamned coal basket in here!
Food: Poisoned
Alice
*Hesitate. Isn&apos;t this place supposed to be your &lt;i&gt;soul?*&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you don&apos;t do favours for strange rats.*
Captain Sech Zapor
*Tell Brahmos you&apos;re beholden to him. You&apos;ve need of a guardian angel and then some.*
*Desperately try and sweep the images away. You are here, in this cave; Saheila is here, alive and well. Alive and well, alive and well...*
*Tell her you&apos;d rather go back to bed with her.*
*All Seven gave away half of their powers? You&apos;re surprised at their generosity...*
Alexandar had survived the battle, but only barely. He was taken captive and held aboard the ship.
High terrain, good cover: the perfect place for an ambush.
*Ifan curls his lip, disdain evident in his eyes.*
They&apos;re tears of joy, I assure you. Here have some joy.
Not long to go now, I&apos;m sure of it.
When she took the throne, though - she met that Isbeil woman. That&apos;s when it all went south. I stood by &apos;er at first, but after a while...
I hate to say &apos;I told you so&apos;.
Frying Pan
Over time I will ask much of you, my champion. But for now, I ask little more than what you know in your heart must be done: Escape this place. Escape the grasp of those who would harm you.
Paladin Marksman
*Tell him that Lohar tried to thwart Queen Justinia&apos;s plan actually.*
Restoration
*He puts his hand on her shoulder, squeezing gently.*
*The woman shifts uneasily in her seat at the sight of your smile.*
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of... milk! That sounds good, mister. But you better believe the bill for &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;will be a doozy!
One of us consumed Liam&apos;s Source.
*Touch the petals.*
