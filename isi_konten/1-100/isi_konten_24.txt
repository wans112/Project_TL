*Tell her no: you walk alone, as you always have.*
*He mentioned the Knights of Drey. Ask who exactly they are.*
*The spirit thinks for a moment... then moves back from the Paladin.*
Food! Mmm.
Thinking? Yes, I&apos;s thinking. I&apos;s thinking you should o&apos;en the chest!
You may see yourself out. Don&apos;t be a stranger. The Doctor will see you soon.
*She&apos;s wrong. You shall.*
Slane destroyed the Shriekers at the harbour.
*Gareth hangs his head in shame.*
Get up. And don&apos;t ever do that again.
*Remark that maybe you&apos;re of demon lineage: that is what you were accused of after all.*
But I&apos;ve no doubt you&apos;ll be seeing to that soon enough.
You. You shouldn&apos;t have come here. Look what you did. For the death of my blood you&apos;ll shed yours.
*An odd-looking young woman is staring intently at the statue to the Divine, fingers curled rigidly at her sides. Greyish-black veins run from her eyes down her cheeks.*
There&apos;s nothing left I can do for you, Lohse. Nothing but feel sorry for you. And that I certainly do.
*Sigh* You ought to have studied more.
Ancient Technology
Talents, by the way, that include seeing beyond that mask of yours. Not to worry, though. I am thoroughly charmed by your... uniqueness. I&apos;ve no intention of sharing your little secret.
Karon told us that Lucian is alive and imprisoned by the Seekers beneath the Cathedral. He claims to know where.
*Ask why a shrine to this goddess is in such a grim place.*
[OUTLAW] *Hold up a gold coin. You pilfered this while she was talking. She can&apos;t be &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;good...*
Kemm&apos;s Vault
*A wave of resentment washes from the spirit before you - an adult life spent in service is rewarded with a forgotten death, out here in the middle of nowhere.*
Dwarven Worshipper
The bodies... the smell of death! What &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;kind calls a spring barbecue...
Costly Amulet
*The attempt is futile. Every inch of your body is useless, though your senses still register every sight, sound, and smell.*
Possessed Elementalist
I don&apos;t agree with everything he&apos;s done, but now that he knows the path to Divinity, he&apos;s our best chance of fighting off the Void.
The demon feedsss... The demon feedsss from the Ring...
I&apos;ve killed, you know, sir! I&apos;ve killed.
Right where I want you...
Care for a sneak peek into someone else&apos;s pockets? Enter sneak mode and &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;sneak behind them&lt;/font&gt; to try to pickpocket them.
*You let your disguise slip for the briefest of moments, revealing a glimpse of the bone underneath, and smile.*
Dragon&apos;s Mouth
*It would be wise to meet with your god again by performing the Meistr&apos;s ritual, here or in Siva&apos;s vault.*
Lever
There are too many!&lt;i&gt; TOO MANY OF THEM!&lt;/i&gt;
A little Sourcerer, come to play.
*He struggles to focus his gaze upon you. A low moan escapes his cracked lips...*
Sadha... I see.
But what is more (and &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; more serious this is too), is that you&apos;ve clearly relinquished your duties by running away from your rightful Master: a crime punishable by death.
Know my name, do you. But I don&apos;t know yours.
*Lash out. Bury your needle right in his eye.*
*The priestess&apos; eyes glaze over and she shivers in fear.*
*Ask what came between them that led to his murder.*
*Admit that you&apos;re not sure. This whole journey hasn&apos;t turned out how you expected it to.*
Natural Conductor
I promise my servants are simple collections of bone and armour. I would not &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; of chaining the living. Why, the very idea is &lt;i&gt;despicable.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the bull he should just enjoy his rest while he can.*
*The dwarf&apos;s face twitches, flickering almost out of control. He looks into your eyes, gaze intense as a hurricane.*
Find where the archeologist cut into the earth. I will draw strength from there to speak again.
Really, you insult me now. This is about fellowship. About a shared world-view amongst devotees of strange and exhilarating experiences. Money is irrelevant.
I need to talk to this one for a few moments. Alone.
Ancient Empire Caravan
*This flower speaks? Ask what it means about the Godwoken.*
What I do here today ensures the survival of my house. It ensures the survival of my work. And I would not give a dog&apos;s bark for your opinions.
As you wish!
Elf Warrior
*Tell him you&apos;re just a man, trying to survive.*
*He says nothing, only twists his lip bitterly as he echoes pointing at the dead. Pointing at the dead, then pointing at you.*
*She pours you yet another cup of tea with an elegant flourish. The pot is seemingly bottomless.*
I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m feeling very fragile and shall retire.
Psst. Shortstop. Wanna buy some stuff? Wanna sell some stuff?
What was dragon became lizard; what is lizard will become dragon once more, though many plot against us.
Cannot reassign [1].&lt;br&gt;The character is in a dialogue.
Maybe. Maybe not. If the queen goes down with Justinia, I won&apos;t be sheddin&apos; a tear, if it means my people are finally free.
Bayknot
*The unlit candle nearby flickers briefly to life. The spirit shakes her head and gives you a dismissive wave.*
Lucian&apos;s Day. Got a few prayers of my own that need answering. But these days, who don&apos;t.
Well, we invited a woman here. Hannag. She&apos;s a teacher, you know - a good one, too. Source ain&apos;t dangerous if you know how to use it, and we had a Sourcerer in the village in want of guidance.
Entropic Bite
Can&apos;t help you there, I&apos;m afraid, though not for lack of tryin&apos;. But I&apos;ll tell ya something. You manage to leave the Joy behind, &apos;n&apos; there&apos;ll be another prison waitin&apos; for ya.
Why the &apos;Seven Gods&apos; exist not now, nor ever have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gods? Ha! Fairytales; phantoms. What more? Who could mistake the mysteries of nature for the hand of a ghost?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bounty and beauty of nature... it seems foolish to assign this wonder to some unknown and unknowing entity. Some may request I cast my mind&apos;s gaze not upon the lilies of the field, but upon the soul of man and the higher beasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this I submit: that I have inspected the inner workings of men and beasts living and dead, and I have found no soul. Only squirming red and bleeding purple. There was no god in those private chambers.
What are you, mad?!
Your grubby fingers will nab whatever&apos;s not nailed down, eh? Time to pay for your crimes!
[1] failed to cast [2], because [3] is no longer a valid target!
Well. If you&apos;re truly sorry, I&apos;ll overlook it this one time. But don&apos;t let it happen again.
*Your attempts to pacify it don&apos;t work. The dragon struggles in your arms, its black eyes turning red with rage. &lt;i&gt;It bites.*&lt;/i&gt;
There! A switch!
The princess would have your head for that language...
Decayed Meat Golem
*Ask who you&apos;re talking to.*
BUBBLING SKIN AND BURNING KNUCKLE!
*Reach your hand towards the spirit and increase your resolve. Your inner might must prevail!*
Shut your mouth, or I&apos;ll fling you in one of these cells, hear me? In fact, get out of here!
The moment all are fit and fighting is the moment we take the mill.
Mupper
*You stay of course. You sleep with her. There&apos;s nothing out there finer than this.*
Ah. I see.
I found Stingtail. When I catch him alone, the interrogation will begin.
Eithne&apos;s Rendezvous Point
Most excellent, Lohse. &lt;i&gt;Most&lt;/i&gt; excellent!
*Tell him you&apos;re with Lohar.*
I need to report to the Sallow Man, fast as I can drag myself.
That&apos;s a relief, Susan.
My Ma beat a Voidwoken. Mmhmm!
Are you the new servant, then? My my. You look like my old handbag if It&apos;d sat in the sun too long. You&apos;ve brought my tea, have you?
*Confess that you haven&apos;t found it yet.*
*He staggers and falls back, misery overwhelming his devastated face. Slumped to the ground, he lets all the straws fall and buries his head in his hands.*
Draught of Intelligence
What can you do to me now? Look: I had orders from Queen Justinia. And, to be honest, I&apos;d reached the end of my tether with what I could do here. It was my time...
Out? You must be mad. Head out one way, you&apos;re back in the Joy among the rabble. Head out another, you&apos;re knee deep in the Hollow Marshes. I&apos;ll take a nice, quiet cell any day of the week and twice on Lucian&apos;s Day.
We all knew only one of us could walk away with divinity.
Magistersâ€™ Lab Directions
[RED PRINCE] *Say that it greatly pleases you to speak to a fellow lizard with such a refined tongue in his, no doubt, noble head.*
You come at last! I&apos;d no doubt you&apos;d find your way to us - not after witnessing your bravery.
Move
&lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; You greedy smell-gilt! &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; Yes, my sleepy friend here killed me for my bloody gold. &lt;i&gt;Hahaha! &lt;/i&gt;Serves me right for all the things I did! &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; The irony! &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that you can always sense when a fellow dwarf&apos;s got a little scheme brewing - what else is he up to?*
[OUTLAW] *Wink and say her fleece would fetch a better price on the black market than your flesh.*
But enough talk. I need more. I need your Source.
*Gareth acknowledges you with a glare.*
Well, I don&apos;t know about multitudes. I jus... I jus&apos; want good things for people, ya know?
&lt;i&gt;The king...&lt;/i&gt; A word that makes one shudder. Yes, I have my suspicions. They are mine to keep.
*Relieved, he gives you a stiff salute, eyes forward.*
Human Skeleton
Flesh Golem
A slave no longer, you still bear the living scar your master used to dominate you. He turned you into an assassin; made you hunt your own kin. Now, you hunt him.
You&apos;re a musician: performer, star, and host to all manner of disembodied visitors. Now, one dark voice has silenced them all - and aims to claim your body for itself.
A crusader in Lucian&apos;s army, you lost your faith as war claimed countless innocents. Now, you&apos;re a Lone Wolf mercenary. Your mission? Kill Lucian&apos;s son.
Leave Game
*Ask her to repeat the riddle.*
*Ignoring you completely, he laughs wickedly and addresses Sadha.*
Critical Hit
*He sighs - contently, it seems; darts his eyes to his demons, then back to you.*
With its significance as the seat of Divinity diminished, Arx fell into decline, and within seven generations had emptied.
I&apos;m sorry but that&apos;s not... I&apos;m so sorry...
As long as you wave your weapons about, I have nothing to say to you.
*Tell him you&apos;d be happy to help him.*
You lack conviction. You remain closed. So too the door. Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more.
Clang. Clang. Horrible old sadist. Filled my brain with holes. The devil lives inside her. Believe you me.

Delete Vignette
*The proprietress gives you a sweet smile.*
Oh. I - of course. Blessings be, brother...
I&apos;ll lead them to the h-harbour, to prepare the attack. Join us when you can... we&apos;ll need all the help we can get...
|No rifle equipped|&lt;br&gt;
Lohar&apos;d gnaw my ear off if he could see the shape his emissaries are in.
Enjoy your stay, mossy.
Destroy this thing - there&apos;s no time to waste!
I&apos;ve got to find my father. I must warn him!
His head! I want to look into his eyes. My boy is dead, my boy is dead - the SNAKE!
&apos;...What He Lackt in Skylle,&lt;br&gt;He Ballanced With Self-Sacrifice.&apos;
*Reconsider. The risk sounds too great.*
Made of pure Source, it will pierce your enemies&apos; armour. I know you shall use it in the service of good. Fare you well, demon-slayer. Fare you well.
Broken Angelic Statue
[IFAN] *Shrug. You&apos;ve certainly had worse.*
You had better move on from here right this instance, or I&apos;ll toss you in one of these cells!
