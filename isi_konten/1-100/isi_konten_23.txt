&lt;b&gt;Soon we will swallow the last of her spirit, and her body will be ours.&lt;/b&gt;
Ah, that&apos;s better. Now, as you were saying...
*Unfortunately, the pages describing the ritual had been ripped out.*
This farmer&apos;s scythe has cut down more crops than men. Although, you probably aim to change that, right?
The God King
*Tell her she needs to be more careful, or she needs to toughen up.*
Am I... am I gonna die?
The Mistake&apos; was a powerful Sourcerer who turned on the Seekers. Many died. The Seekers lost Alexandar&apos;s favour and went underground.
Not a chance, no way, no how. Sure, he wanted to defeat the Black Ring, but he wouldn&apos;t&apos;a wiped out all that land.
Hmm. Yes. I suppose you&apos;ve got a ditch to go stare at, or some such. And to think I was going to offer to let you profit from my misfortunes.
Greetings, my most scarlet of princes. I see you chose to serve your people. Very wise.
*Tell him the hunger he gave you hasn&apos;t quite abated. If anything you hunger even more strongly.*
They were already among us, Isbeil said, preparing to steal our children in the name of the Divine Order, masquerading as the poor, the helpless, inciting our people to violence. I... only wanted the kingdom to be safe.
*Lohse stares straight ahead, eyes black, skin grey, a malevolent grin plastered across her face.*
Dead Dwarven Thief
*Shake your head and say you&apos;re looking to talk. Ask what she&apos;s working on.*
*The spirit fades - at last - to nothing.*
*Ask them what they expect to see, staring at the water.*
A weapon of untold destruction. And you use this against your own kind? Knowing it ends their existence? How efficient...
If that&apos;s all you have to say, you may as well leave me to it, then.
So he got outta the cage, then? Figures. Everywhere ya look, there&apos;s dark magic pullin&apos; the strings. And here ya tellin&apos; me I was one of the puppets.
*The flame still burns and the statue still stands.*
*His last words dissipate as his energy is wholly subsumed into your own. You feel a tiny, hateful kernel struggle within yourself. Struggle, then evaporate.*
We met Malady on Bloodmoon Island. She didn&apos;t have time to talk.

Nice statue, as statues go.
Angelic Statue
We liberated the fletcher Corbin Day from the Lone Wolves, and invited him on board the Lady Vengeance.
And all I have to show for is &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
Damn! If it&apos;s not one thing, it&apos;s another - and no way I can trust those fools to deal with any nonsense on their own. Can&apos;t leave the prisoner alone, though. He&apos;s been nothing but trouble, I hear.
Nailbomb Trap
*Nod. You want to trade.*
It is about &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt;, and power is not given. It is taken.
I see. It does so satisfy to have a purpose in life.
Mysterious Container
*Beast strokes his beard for a few seconds, buries his hand inside it, then whips it out again to display his extended middle finger. He marches past, finger still raised, to the chagrin of the gawking guard.*
Beast, eh? On t-the run from Fort Joy, are you?
*Let her know that idle gossip is always a shame.*
Miss, yes miss! I&apos;ll do that! And I&apos;ll go find my mum!
Then you prove yourself ignorant, sir. The Voidwoken are drawn to Source. With these collars on, no Source can flow from us. We are safer here than anywhere in Rivellon. You can thank the Divine Order for that.
Saving all the fun for later?
You&apos;re as bad as she is. Get lost then, you&apos;re no use to me.
*He considers you for a moment, then shakes his head.*
*Putting childhood lessons to good use, you translate enough to gather that this was a Death Herald altar.*
Heh. I wouldn&apos;t expect you to understand. I got a&lt;i&gt; code&lt;/i&gt;, you know.
I see that excuse for exactly what it is: a lie. You&apos;re under arrest! Be glad you do not face a worse fate than prison.
*The Red Prince stands stunned, gazing upon the beautiful lizard woman before him.*
*She&apos;s too sure of herself. Tell her she should be thinking of teaming up and getting out of here.*
You should&apos;ve stayed in the cells - no more leniency!
[SCHOLAR] *You&apos;ve read about designs such as this before - a password must be written on the blank parchment in order to unlock the desk.*
*The creature&apos;s eyes roll in your direction. Its gasps grow more urgent.*
No matter what lies ahead, we &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; hunt him down.
The Void itself is hunting down the gods, leeching them in ways I only dreamed were possible. Drop by drop they drain away, and  your path forward becomes all the clearer.
Please wait until the game has finished installing.
Too bad there&apos;s not a bit of meat to you. Guess my hounds&apos;ll have to be happy with the bones.
*Gareth&apos;s form slumps low to the ground, as if even resisting gravity is proving exhausting.*
Tatty Book
*Ask who this goddess Amadia is.*

Divine
*...and the meaning in her glare is clear; you should not help. The elves send Sarias to his final resting place.*
I recognise this material: tenebrium! This is not to be trifled with; it&apos;s the stuff that was used to forge Death Knights.
And don&apos;t you expect that to change, neither. You helped me out, but I don&apos;t owe you nothin. Dwarf.
Dead Worker&apos;s Chest
Definitely couldn&apos;t hurt. I hope.
No… no, you&apos;re right. I could be any squirrel knight riding a dead cat…
Let it be done, Lohse.
*Play the innocent.*
&lt;br&gt;Character is unable to run.
*Give the gentle approach one more shot. Look into her eyes and ask what she saw.*
One of us wouldn&apos;t kill our own. They&apos;re picking us off, one by one!
I bet that&apos;s just what they&apos;ll look like.
An Inquiry on Rare Source Relics
*Allow her to see Borris in Fort Joy - in a position of authority and happy to use it.*
[SOLDIER] *Don&apos;t move. You stand alert, your senses primed.*
Hmm, hmm-hmm...
*Ask what she&apos;s selling.*
Last Rite
Our journey began on a ship and our journey ends on a ship. Our mutual journey that is. I&apos;ve no interest in pursuing my best interests with &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; by my side.
*Enquire once again about what unfolded at the consulate.*
Assault! Assault!
Reaper, reaper...
Each portal is an opportunity for the Black Ring to infiltrate my sanctuary. Once you depart, the entrance will close, as much as it pains me. The Empire&apos;s future must be assured!
(continue)
The spirit of Edie Engrym went to the Hall of Echoes.
What&apos;s this now? A bribe? What are you trying to pull?
*Tell him truth: You helped Magister Delorus, and he told you he&apos;d help you get access to this boat.*
*Say you&apos;ll try to find out what you can. Ask for any information that might help.*
You see, the demon that you killed, the Advocate, he had a master...
Item received
I mean... yes, I suppose you could have drained the power from it, but that would have weakened it significantly. It would be quite irresponsible.
*It closes its eyes, steels itself for what&apos;s coming.*
*Tell her your business is hurting people who won&apos;t let you do what you want.*
Lead the way, my darling.
Indeed. The dragon will torment you will false promises, but I cannot aid you until recovering my strength.
Explore the Academy.
*He stumbles and coughs, then regains his composure. His eyes narrow malevolently.*
*Do as she says.*
And yet he treated me...
A team? What an interesting prospect.
Cracked Sword
But - she&apos;s really nice - and tall! Maybe she can even help you with that thing...
Should&apos;ve asked for double that amount, really...
Damned breath, a bomb? He could end us all, and half of Driftwood too. It&apos;s too much of a risk...
*Agree immediately. You can&apos;t wait to get this damned thing off.*
I know you. You are better than this. Show me the goodness of your heart, Godwoken, and I will share my power. &lt;i&gt;Set me free...&lt;/i&gt;
You spared me from that, at least. Thank you.
*Say that they called you traitors.*
I hid it in these very caves, although I can feel its distance now. Someone has uncovered it.
I refused to obey Saheila and plunge elvendom deeper into chaos. Instead I took root. My rightful place is at the heart of my people.
SPEAK!
*The vision shatters as the soul squirms away from you, curling up in the bottom of the jar.*
Allow the figure within to guide you, traveller. Now go. Follow the wind.
Get away from me, pig prince. NOW.
Well, it&apos;s...

As you so rightfully point out, sir, &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; unlike a butler.
Removes Invisibility and illusions set by the Sallow Man.
Speak its name, however, and you expose it. You weaken it. You&apos;ll know him when you find him. A doctor that accommodates a demon doesn&apos;t see patients - only victims.

Mug Of Blood
Look at that: a fresh face! Shrewd &apos;n&apos; sophisticated, like any true lizard!
Me eyes must be playin&apos; tricks. Ain&apos;t never seen a red lizard before. You real, or am I dreamin&apos;?
*Cold metal presses against you to soothe the ache. When you reach for it, your fingers catch on a pair of greaves.*
Fight
Look alive! Got a fool to shred, so we do!
*Brush off his question; you can&apos;t be responsible for a kid right now.*
I didn&apos;t always work here, stranger. We dwarves aren&apos;t all burps and brawls - not that the likes of you would understand that...
Now, we struck no such accord, but my master&apos;s generosity is surpassed only by his power. Here, let me show you...
I&apos;m so sorry, madam, I shall remove these clothes immediately.
I like my men the way I like my cheese: BLACK AND BLUE.
Do what you will, fool. She&apos;s beyond saving!
*Allow your voice to take Almira&apos;s tone. Tell him the vessel to whom he speaks is hers.*
Lies! Heretical nonsense to try and dissuade me from the path! It won&apos;t work.
Sing for me (Bobby&apos;s version)
The Sallow Man is no more.
Tower of Braccus Rex
*The dwarf rocks back and forth, staring at nothing.*
Whatever you have done to anger the goddess is your concern. I can only trust in her love to lead you to the light, as I have others.
*Brush her hand away and take her life.*
Intervene in the execution, or allow it to proceed.
*Tell her you have the limbs right here for her.*

Well, look what I found. Looks like you&apos;ll be spending some time in prison!
