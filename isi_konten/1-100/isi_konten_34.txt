Ah! I &lt;i&gt;do like&lt;/i&gt; music. I created a neverending music box for a lizard viceroy once... in fact I do believe the box has outlived the lizard. Ancient Empire politics are so &lt;i&gt;cut-throat!&lt;/i&gt;
Wh... what?
Magical
*He grimaces and tucks it underneath his arm, squeezing it tight.*
I knew those collars wouldn&apos;t tame animals like them.
*Say that if he knows a way for you to get out of here, you&apos;d really like to hear it.*
You deaf? I warned you to keep away from here!
I do not ascend, but nor do I die in the trials. So I dedicate my life to Tir-Cendelius and protect the Godwoken that come here.
*Say that phoenixes wither in both body and mind as they age. Fire will rejuvenate its body and restore its memories of its true self.*
*Engraved on the plaque are the words &lt;i&gt;&apos;3: Discipline of Body&apos;.*&lt;/i&gt;
Hmph!
The Little Book of Big Booms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By Zyrzyg Xollenfolzd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rain and lightning; blood and oil! These are the ingredients of Rivellon’s most explosive recipes. Consider these combinations when trolls come seeking a holiday feast!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fire and water: For a nice, sizzling steam bath&lt;br&gt;Fire and oil: When a small, contained blaze just isn’t enough&lt;br&gt;Fire and blood: Because there’s nothing more fearsome than a cloud of blood&lt;br&gt;Fire and poison: Consider the blast your guests’ main course - and the ensuing mist their dessert!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And remember: You can add electricity to any cloud for a shocking, spicy finish.

If others have not already claimed the chest, then douse the flames, kin, and sing these words. It will be yours.
But you were a Sourcerer no more.
*Growl that you&apos;re taking a closer look regardless of what the cat says - it would be better if it just stood down.*
*Tell the elf you&apos;ve been to the afterlife and back to get here. He will stand aside or be cut down.*
Keep your hands away from my canvas - understand?
Swallowed too much seawater, by the looks of him...
Helluva city, hey? She gets knocked down and we build her up again, better&apos;n before. Right there, that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;creation.&lt;/i&gt; Plus, you know y&apos;rself, there&apos;s money to be made. *Winks.*
*The Sergeant doesn&apos;t seem interested in talking to you. She shoots you a disdainful look before turning away, muttering something about &apos;underlings exceeding their authority&apos; under her breath.*
Spirit of Magister Ranger
And besides, my parents are surely in the Halls.
*Impatience flashes in his eyes and is gone.*
EMPTY
*Draw your weapon and smile. You&apos;re here for revenge.*
Goodness. I&apos;ve met street urchins with more manners. I&apos;d think an old soul might have more respect for ceremony.
*Ask about Malady. You thought she was a Seeker, too...*
An arrow from [1]
The Spirit of the Ancestor Tree
What&apos;ll it be?
*Wave your hand in front of the creature&apos;s face.*
Tension: Low&lt;br&gt;You are safe to move around and do as you please.
Armoured Human
Hall of Echoes - World Collapsing
*His posture relaxes slightly and his gaze returns to the altar before him, stained with ancient swathes of red.*
*Pick up his sword and return it to him.*
Prisoner or not, I swore an oath. Touch him again and I&apos;ll kill you.
*Smirk that you killed her, of course.*
Initiate Shoes
*Bid him wait. You&apos;ll ensure that divinity is used for good.*
Another such as you...? You mustn&apos;t even know how to enter the council yet - why would you still linger here if you did?
No-one deserves the fear and pain I felt in that vision. Not even a necromancer.
Onslaught
I know.
Someone like you passed by earlier. But that doesn&apos;t answer my question.
*Harina? How could you forget - she was your best assistant in the library.*
Why? Did you assume I wouldn&apos;t?
Disappointing. Let me ask you - what do you stand for, if not for life? You would lie down and let the Void swallow you without so much as raising a hand?
*Point out that he enjoys a bit of embellishment. Can you trust him to be honest with you?*
We freed the elf Amyro from his cage. In gratitude, he told us of a possible route out of the Fort.
Thought you were someone else for a second there, lad. Someone with &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; business in Driftwood. But enough of all that... what word do you bring?
I can make this work.
But time brings perspective. And perspective brings mercy. You are &lt;i&gt;permitted &lt;/i&gt;to live, magus.
*The mewling cub looks up at you with the saddest eyes you&apos;ve ever seen. Then it turns away. There&apos;s nothing you can do.*
The mysterious voices spoke yet again. They seem to see something in each of us, and want us to do something... What, exactly, remains unclear...
It was almost comforting to see such a beautiful chest wreathed in flame.
*Agree. No corpse, no confirmation.*
You have no concept of loyalty. No concept of duty.
Many a great noble perished in that sudden hell. As for myself, I&apos;m glad I survived long enough to collect what treasures I could, as the Red Princess would surely have wished. Surely you might find something useful among them...?
Shhh! She&apos;ll find me!
Give in, Godwoken. Your time is done.
Executor Ninyan&apos;s Axe
*The Paladin&apos;s words are cut off as the pommel of Kemm&apos;s sword catches her on the chin, sending a splash of blood across the cobbles.*
*Give him a hand-out.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Spirit of a Peasant
*Ask him about that &lt;i&gt;errand&lt;/i&gt; he mentioned earlier; it sounds highly suspicious.*
*It doesn&apos;t open.*
|being thrown by explosions.|
Tread carefully, my dear. Those are Black Ring banners that I spy on the shore...
It is right that they become our soil in turn. We honour them. It is a holy act.
...Sorry, I didn&apos;t catch that.
*The queen retracts her hand and rewards your reverence with a curt nod.*
Blessed Source Infusion
Th- the Sallow man?
You know nothing. Piss off.
Tyrant&apos;s Helm
I delight at your return.
Pillow
*Press yourself against her - mouth, chest, hips, moving to a secret rhythm only you two share.*
Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more. There is violence. There is lust. There is foolishness. The sentence is more. The sentence is pain eternal. What is the sin?
Don&apos;t lecture &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;on justice, slaver. He had the effects of one of our company. He&apos;s guilty.
Sneak up on unsuspecting parties to hear conversations that might not be meant for you.
Put your weapons away. I don&apos;t want to see any violence here.
*And then you are her, you are the young woman Edie Engrym, seduced by a boy. But to become a Lone Wolf he had to pass a test - he had to murder the woman he loved.*
Kids at war! Hmm...
They plan to inherit the Everlasting Forest once the acorn drops and the world is rid of all giants. They believe that only the arboreal will - and should - survive.
Beast! Come... come closer... so that you may see me... as I truly am...
While some of us have a thimble of Source, others have a cup. A Sourcerer can sip from their cup and use that Source to perform powerful magic.
Lucian promised a paradise in death. &lt;i&gt;&apos;In The Hall, your tears are dried and your pain is soothed.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
*The figure plants a foot before you and swings his sword down, hard, stopping short just over the base of your skull. The sword seems to hesitate, enticing the fine hairs on your neck upward.*
*Nonsensical words sprawl across this book, as if an ogre had eaten the alphabet and vomited upon the paper. You presume it to be some kind of code, but have no interest in deciphering it.*
*Try as he might, Tarquin cannot hide a small flash of surprise.*
To the Happy Couple upon this Special Occasion:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though unmatched by the bride&apos;s own sweetness, may I offer this confection as a symbol of the sugared desire on which new love glides. May you enjoy each rich bite, and the explosive finish soon to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS: I&apos;m told a certain Isbeil has made the guest list. Please ensure she&apos;s present when the cake is sliced. She will surely erupt with joy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Kind Regards,&lt;br&gt;The Doctor
Choose surface to teleport.
Toad.
A small treasure trove.
Enter Gall&apos;s lab.
Two-Handed Straight Axe
MAKE HASTE! &lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt; Master awaits. Master will be angry.
One last decision remained - Divinity, and the fate of the world. My companions supported my claim.
With the sun on their backs and the wind in their sails,
Paladin Brute
*Give Gareth your thanks. It was an honour to fight at his side.*
*A vision. You watch a battle from above as it rages upon... a ship at sea? A cyclone of Source and light rises from it. Your eyes, your mind... seared and scarred...*
He&apos;s a tinkerer type, named Higba. Grey beard and a dark cloak, according to reports. He&apos;s still here somewhere; he can&apos;t have gotten out of Driftwood - not past our barricades.
Find a kin dreamer.
Excellent. Where the spirit longs to return, I have an anchor. I can speak again!
Betray them? I &lt;i&gt;liberated&lt;/i&gt; them!
The only travesty is that &lt;i&gt;anyone &lt;/i&gt;could be unwilling to sacrifice what must be sacrificed.
*Say that it&apos;s over. There wasn&apos;t anything else he could have done.*
*The stringy flesh gives way beneath your teeth and liquid, warm and coppery, fills your mouth. You look around... a nearby Magister has his heart cut out, and the reaver&apos;s gauntlet is bloodied...*
*A rather excitable-looking rat skitters around your ankles and looks at you almost... &lt;i&gt;pleadingly.*&lt;/i&gt;
A place called Driftwood. Host to putrid fish, putrid dwarves, and Meistr Siva herself.
Grenades &amp; Traps
Holy Fire
*Fane holds up his shape-shifted hand, turning it in the cool light.*
*Bark! Bark! Growl! Yap! BARK!*
*Beast&apos;s brow twists into knots.*
Source connects you to your companions even when you&apos;re apart, allowing you to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/font&gt; to their important moments. Since you are not nearby for this conversation, your companion will participate in it alone.
Although...
Look around you, madam! I live among the graves. I&apos;d be a most unsavory neighbour if I let myself wallow in ignorance of my own community.
That&apos;s internal Order business. You&apos;d do well to leave it alone. Let&apos;s just say Zusan there was of help to Sourcerers, and leave it at that.
I&apos;ve taught you a Source spell. Something ultimately powerful. Something only people like you - &lt;i&gt;special &lt;/i&gt;people - can learn.
Perhaps I&apos;ll even dedicate my next book to you.
Tell me what you saw.
Masked Servant
I was just lounging about on the deck contemplating a most peculiar thing: I hear that you were told to learn everything you can about Source, and what do you do? Refuse such knowledge when it&apos;s offered to you on a silver platter.
So few look for trouble, and yet so many stumble across it. But do not think your lying tongue can save you.
You light the torches without knowing my sacrifice? You&apos;ve summoned the great Prophet Patryk. I knew Braccus, and knew his secrets. I saw his rise and fall as woven into the Tapestry of Time.
Arhgh! Evil on the loose!
Justinia returned to her throne.
And then this Seeker arrived. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the Source-ridden scum is in league with them too.
*Hold out a gold piece. When he reaches for it, drop it in the dirt. Say &apos;oops&apos;.*
Squeeeeaaaaaak...
By Lucian, I know it&apos;s wrong - but I&apos;ll be glad to see her dead.
Ah! The armour set is complete!
A thick, cloudy drink that sharpens the Finesse of the drinker.
*Say: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Just one little elf.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Name&apos;s Gareth. I&apos;m a Seeker. And I can help you.
But if you believe in them... I trust you.
Come... come closer... so that you may see me... as I truly am...
