*Fane is reading his notebook, poring over the notes he took on his journey. As you approach, he tears out a page and throws it overboard.*
*Your soul rejoins your body with the same force with which it left.*
We found a little girl, possessed by a demon.
*The door does not open. It &lt;i&gt;examines &lt;/i&gt;you.*
*Filthy water spews from the ancient gargoyle&apos;s mouth as it begins to speak to you.*
Think you&apos;re cute, do ye? Get shoppin&apos; or leave me be.
They&apos;re gone. But it&apos;s never really over.
Vampire
*Your bones were lost for eons. Then mortal miners unearthed you, and a mad artisan forged your remains into armour.*
What do you want?
My Jar remains. I wait... I will reclaim...
You ended my suffering.
*Follow their lead. Take a piece of heart, put it in your mouth, and swallow.*
*She shrinks into the foetal position.*
*Thank them and take your leave.*
*Nod to the portal. It&apos;s time to see what&apos;s on the other side.*
Search the cellar of the abandoned house.
The Scion of the Mother Tree ate the heart of the Shadow Prince, then bade me fulfill my destiny and take root.
*Remind him who he&apos;s speaking to, and tell him that he ought to show more deference.*
Don&apos;t underestimate the Burnished One. He won&apos;t underestimate you.
*As the flesh dissolves, you see through a muddy haze, gargoyles, a corridor beyond, its secrets beautiful in their complexity...*
Also, you will likely encounter Sworn followers of the God King on that island, I suspect. I would avoid combat if possible; death can be... &lt;i&gt;less than final&lt;/i&gt; for them, if the God King wills it...
Have a look. Mind you don&apos;t tear any pages, now.
Now let go of me. &lt;i&gt;At once.&lt;/i&gt;
Isla Gall
*Announce that you know who is responsible for the disappearances of his comrades.*
And the Hammer&apos;s a solid sort! Don&apos;t take no guff and don&apos;t stand for no idlin&apos; - earned that name for a reason, she did. *Hack!*
But this I will defend with my life. And your life. And the life of anyone who stands in the way of the continuance of our realm.
*Rearing back, he clouts your hand away, a look of disgust on his face.*
The blood within this vial glows faintly with the essence of Source.
[JESTER] *Say the worms. Definitely the worms.*
Find him. Feel his heart. Squeeze it dry. Squeeze it dead. Bring the head. Bring the head.
Murder? Ahh, that&apos;s what they were going on and on about.
Paladin Guardian
Raven&apos;s Wing
Ah. My fate, it seems, is not my own to call.
*This doesn&apos;t seem like the optimal part of the ship to hang around. Take your leave.*
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 5: The Chaos War
No! Necromancy is an... unsavoury practice. Surely you above all understand that... &lt;i&gt;dragged &lt;/i&gt;back from your slumber to live some sort of half-life... the cat is a cunning illusion that I devised - nothing more.
Are you trying to bribe me? What a daft mistake that was. You&apos;re under arrest!
&lt;i&gt;Hail, hail...&lt;/i&gt;
You have the vision of a god now: sight that can see spirits - the souls of the dead made manifest in Source.
*Hold the wire out of reach, and say that you want to hear a proper ending to his story first.*
*Ignore his question and tell him your Source has outshined even Hannag&apos;s. She is dead.*
Deathleech

*Thank him for the gift.*
That&apos;s just his way. Make yourself useful, and he&apos;ll take good care of ya. Cross him, and... well, you&apos;ll wish you hadn&apos;t.
I s&apos;ppose a game of fetch is out of the question.
Dritta Evyet
Hold it there! You are under arrest for assault! Off to prison with you, then.
*You sense an &lt;i&gt;interest&lt;/i&gt; within the cold voice addressing you. Beyond the interest, you sense fangs, voracious hunger, a bottomless appetite that no sustenance could ever sate.*
*Tell him to hand it over. You&apos;ll see to this Amyro matter.*
The Sourcerer Vasnya told us that a Sourcerer was tortured by Magisters and spoke of &apos;Seekers&apos; and &apos;Godwoken&apos;.

Did that scarecrow just speak to me...?
Finesse
*And then you lose her at the death. Your death. Your bitter death.*
No time to dilly-dally! Won&apos;t be long now before dinner is served.
Find Mordus. That&apos;s all that matters now.
*Duggan stands over Leya, singing softly as she mutters about Gareth.*
Now... if you&apos;ll pardon me. As I&apos;m sure you can imagine, I have terribly many affairs to tend to. Such chaos to right in the wake of this disaster.
That&apos;s settled then. Why don&apos;t you, er... enjoy a nice stroll? A nice, long stroll while the lady and I enjoy a more private moment.
I don&apos;t get it. Maybe I&apos;m too young to get it! I want my mum!
*Tell the door to open.*
*Compliment Fane on his mask. It&apos;s really quite convincing.*
Too heavy. Needs a lever, a key, or a troll.
Ain&apos;t no getaway happenin&apos; here, an&apos; if there is I ain&apos;t involved. Geddit?
*Tell him the last time you saw Delorus was on the Nameless Isle. You had the honour to be able to render him a service. When you left him he was safe and well.*
*The grip on your lungs loosens. You gulp in the fresh air, thirsting for it as a desert rose thirsts for water.*
*The reaver weaves and rocks on her feet, as if dancing to some unheard rhythm. Madness flashes in her eyes.*
Disable
[NOBLE] *Let out a sigh of relief - at last, someone with a civil tongue in their heads.*
Him leavin&apos;s a worry, but the roads ain&apos;t any safer than Driftwood.
&apos;He laughs and puts another fletching feather in his cap...&apos;
They&apos;re... just ordinary rats. Nothing special or awful about them at all. Wouldn&apos;t let them worry you.
You real, or am I dreamin&apos;?
Dallis is so very close to her goal. She must be at the Cathedral as we speak, hovering above Lucian&apos;s holy corpse, the Aeteran in hand. At last she will purge the powers of the gods still raging within!
Houndmaster&apos;s Crossbow
*She turns to you. Gives you a sad smile. Turns away again.*
You may not speak to him directly, but he is always guiding you. In this you must trust me.
The Lord Dread lies in the harbour, but the Hammer isn&apos;t aboard. Nor is she among the piles of Magister bodies.
Cannibalise Skillbook
*Its soul? How does it intend to retrieve it?*
*Smile and hold out the jar. As she leans in to take it, drop it to the ground.*
They&apos;re just animals. Easy enough to euthanize.
In a world of peace you could live forever. Your future was yours to decide. But you were a Sourcerer no more. Did you accept your new status with gratitude, or did you rebel?
This flag is in another region. You can&apos;t see it yet.
*He whispers that there&apos;s really no need for your assistance. But the weight of his arms around you tells a different tale.*
*Your kick lands right where you wanted it to. Red Prince staggers back, wincing, but the fury in his eyes remains undiminished.*
*Close the book and back away.*
&apos;til then!
Do not forget this blessed day...
*Listen on.*
You just don&apos;t know when to stop. Prepare to die!

A shot that deals [1] and receives [2]% bonus damage per 1m distance to target.
No. No. Right now I just... I just want to be somewhere else. With &lt;i&gt;you. &lt;/i&gt;All that stuff will still be waiting for us when we&apos;re ready for it.
I...
Take All
*Offer to drag it back into the water.*
[FANE] *You freeze. She expects something from you. Imitate the only human ritual you know - extend your hand and loudly say &apos;nice to meet you&apos;.*
Water
I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have an amulet with me right now, but I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be able to find one. Next, you&apos;ll need the Scroll of Atonement. It&apos;s in my desk, on the second floor. The password is &apos;Giyora&apos;.
*Say he ought to return you from whence you came and leave you be. You want nothing to do with this interrogation.*
Won&apos;t like &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; one little bit.
Tavern - Interior (Empty)
The Whites - backstabbers, all of them.
Oh, but they called me by so many different names. First Sourcerer, then Godwoken, all the while dangling another one in front of me: &lt;i&gt;Divine. &lt;/i&gt;You &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;know how it is, hm?
*Say it certainly looks like &lt;i&gt;everybody&lt;/i&gt; is gone, one way or another.*
Attribute Checks
How about a little... ungh... damned privacy!
Don&apos;t worry, Geraldine, I&apos;ll look after you.
*She purses her lips and coyly tilts her head.*
Anyway. Enough chit-chat. I&apos;ve got a contract to be fulfilling. The same Godwoken contract &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; couldn&apos;t hack even one piece of.
This spirit life is no life at all... there is nothing tactile about it, nothing &lt;i&gt;sensual&lt;/i&gt;. Don&apos;t make haste to see it for yourself.
What do you say we bury the hatchet, you and I? For now at least.
Only she who &lt;i&gt;claims&lt;/i&gt; everything will &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; everything. The Void&apos;s doom; this world&apos;s liberator.
That was my last living memory. The demon may be gone, but its disease still infects my roots, birthing evil into the surrounding soil. While it lives, I am still its rotting servant.
We did not deal with the Doctor.
Heh, bold, aren&apos;t ya? Best - *cough* best burn it all. The Reds... they won&apos;t want what I got.
*The intense man raises his eyebrows, a look of grudging respect on his face.*
What now? Heh, kiddo, you&apos;re talking crazy! It&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;tree&lt;/i&gt;, not a person. Even if it used to be a person, it ain&apos;t anymore.
Get over here and stop these idiots before we all die!
I cannot argue with such a sum. Go on your way. Cause no more trouble.
Are we safe? At last, I can breathe again!
*Angrily attest you are no demon - you merely summoned them!*

I... I... I have done all I can. There is nothing more...
You&apos;ll have to excuse me. Busy times.
*The otherwise crisp parchment is stained with two dark, oily fingerprints. It smells faintly of sulphur.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madam,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good news: Initial excavation of the cave has proven promising. The ruins described by your informant appear totally intact, though difficult to penetrate.&lt;br&gt;Will send another message as any new developments arise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magister General Arnauld&lt;br&gt;Master of Engineering
Yes, but these weren&apos;t castles in the sky, were they? Quite obviously I was musing over the very actual empire that I lost!
Hahaha! Have you &lt;i&gt;met&lt;/i&gt; my nincompoop daughter? Did you know she once threw a handful of coins out the window and screamed &apos;It&apos;s raining gold!&apos;?
*Shrug. She could always &apos;lose&apos; it and avoid the risk.*

Try using &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/font&gt; to clear poison surfaces and clouds. A fire spell or fire arrow should do the trick.

Somewhere on this ancient isle, there must be a clue that will help us stop the acorn.
