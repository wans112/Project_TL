What do you want, dwarf? You can&apos;t just come in here as you please - there&apos;s Magisters missing; I&apos;m trying to conduct a bloody investigation!
War-Owl Whistle
No! Don&apos;t leave! I have friends! I know people. They can teach you, just please - don&apos;t leave me here!
If you choose life, you choose the Well of Ascension! I will lead you there when you&apos;re ready: when you&apos;ve become a true Master of the Source, and speak the language of creation itself.
I... I reckon I&apos;ll find my boy. Good lad. Good, good lad...
This neatly-folded rectangle of parchment bears the official seal of the Divine Order.
Curse you... go away!
Druid&apos;s Hidden Stash

The whispers and the taunts. The low howls of men.
AUGH!
Hrrm. Perhaps you&apos;re not a spy then. But there&apos;s something off about you...
*He closes his eyes as he speaks, forehead creasing with effort.*
*Ask if she has any idea who the real culprit might be.*
A doctor? Well, I hear of a healer at the sacred cathedral. Maybe she helps...
This enigmatic key is stamped with a white skull: the Magister symbol for Deathfog.
Hrrmh, alight then. Now leave me be - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
*Motion to the destruction around you. What&apos;s going on here? What have they seen?*
Vrogir. I am your servant to my last breath.
You feel it, don&apos;t you? The rarity of this power? Its ability to create new worlds - or destroy them?
&apos;Hurry&apos;, she said. So I hurried. And hurried some more. Tore my skin and muscles to shreds, and got all but buried alive for the effort.
That door&apos;s been sealed for centuries, but &lt;i&gt;now &lt;/i&gt;you&apos;re here to check on us?
*Say you&apos;re looking for an executioner - someone who can deal a lot of damage, up close and personal. A Knight would fit the bill.*
Find the Sallow Man.
There could be Voidwoken nearby. Stay ready.
*Ask if you might collect some milk.*
I had your blood. I HAD YOUR BLOOD! Thief! Crook! DEFAULTER!
Come and browse. I can coax out the magic within you.
I&apos;m not privy to the details of milord&apos;s ventures, but I gather his outing pertains to his office as Grandmaster of the Paladins, and the ousting of certain firebrands from the city. A most noble task, I&apos;m sure.
I don&apos;t have luck left to push, if you ask me. But sure. Fine. Bye.
Now you&apos;re talking! This is it... right now... &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; is the life.
*He lowers his eyebrows and blinks twice.*
We successfully exorcised the dwarf. Now we have to banish its demon.
Players
Let&apos;s make that fire within you more than just a metaphor, shall we?
*Tell her you don&apos;t deserve her love, but you&apos;ll gladly accept it.*
An intimidating presence whose bone-chilling powers terrify friend and foe alike
Even as I sat on the Prime Scion&apos;s throne as a child, watching pilgrims pass by in worship, I could hear her whisper - much like the Master would whisper.

Take that, and get out of here, elf.
*Tell her you try not to argue with Magisters, and turn away.*

You&apos;re blocking my light. Go away.

Reclaiming the Council of Seven
*Wonder if there&apos;s any extra-special discount for guessing all of the Four Sisters riddles.*
That would I do, but there is strong magic at play here... I am... bound still. Even as my body shall crumble, my very soul remains trapped in my bones...
*Ask her to describe some of what she&apos;s imagined.*
*Tell him he&apos;s mistaken. You&apos;re no more Godwoken than he is.*
Mistress is &lt;i&gt;free! &lt;/i&gt;I can sense it. She will summon me now - she must do!
I never thought she meant to do us wrong. I don&apos;t blame her for fleeing to the Cloisterwood. I worry for her.

Brilliant Necklace
*Ask what&apos;s the purpose of the Academy.*
That Lohar... I know the guy. Calls himself an entrepreneur, but that&apos;s jus&apos; a fancy word for &apos;thug&apos;. Got his finger in every pie in Driftwood. Reckon he&apos;s still there. Ain&apos;t the trout making that place smell so fishy.
*Windego&apos;s spirit quakes. She is no longer the arrogant banshee that summoned a kraken and brought down a Magister vessel, but a fearful child bracing for parental punishment.*

Cavern Hole
*Hold up the gem. Point out that you have the gem.*
Here lies a vagrant poacher, who saw fit to slay my beloved pet stag for his meat and skin. The cur&apos;s prize will lie with him here forever, but the meat will never nourish him, nor will the pelt ever warm him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are reading this note, consider it a warning - take from me, and I shall take tenfold from you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryker.
Alright, hand it over. And it had better be good.
*The spirit doesn&apos;t answer. She just stares at you mournfully.*
Welcome, my friend. I&apos;m glad you could come. Tell me, what ails you?
*Tell her that you just really, really, &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;want it.*

GREETINGS PAULINA KEMM - LADY OF THE HOUSE - ELEGANT AND SAGE
She asked him for kisses.

Undead Elf
*Reach out and consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Suggest she report her daughter missing to the authorities.*
Storm
We decided to travel with Malady to the demon&apos;s home realm. There, we&apos;ll find a way to weaken him.
Spanish
*Kemm narrows his eyes and tilts his head. You are being &lt;i&gt;considered.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him not to worry - you&apos;ll help his mother.*
Villain
*A spectral arrow suddenly lodges itself between his eyes with a hollow &lt;i&gt;thwack.&lt;/i&gt; His face turns slack and confused, before he collapses backwards in a heap.*
Not my problem. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some scurvy tosser around here who&apos;ll promise to sneak you out. What they&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; do to you is another matter...
*Almira&apos;s eyes light up, and she accepts the pieces eagerly.*
*She smiles at you in gratitude.*
A gleaming arrowhead perpetually coated with condensation; if you don&apos;t use it to craft a special arrow, you might as well have it handy to keep your drinks cold.
Render the Advocate a service.
*Let him figure it out for himself and walk away.*
Besides, it doesn&apos;t matter if you don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;let it matter&lt;/i&gt; - Black Ring, Divine Order... all labels try to define who we are. As soon as a skin is of no more use to me, I shed it. You ought to try it sometime, &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;.
*The White Magister swiftly pivots towards you and draws his blade.*
Such a squirmy little twit is Borris, no? What icky little &lt;i&gt;favours &lt;/i&gt;did he manage to squeeze out of you for the aid?
*This flower speaks? Ask what it means about the Godwoken.*
You have prevailed as Champion of the Council Academy, and are now rightfully known as... The One.

Beast! You&apos;ve come not a moment too soon. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt; Even &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt;

Yeah.
You&apos;re too fleshy by double, but Cap&apos;d probably look forward to spillin&apos; yer guts for the fun of it.
Eight lives already gone, but I&apos;d gladly... *urp*... lose the last if you can throw me a fish. One of those... smelly kind.
*His eyes attest to a desperation you&apos;ve never seen him acknowledge in any way whatsoever before.*
The issue at hand is a simple one - we have suffered a Black Ring incursion into our sacred groves. They surround a tree that sits at the heart of this fair isle.
You again? Here to sneer at the curious some more, are you?

Sadha. The secret of my soul. I think that perhaps I value her more highly now even than divinity.
[SEBILLE] *Say he&apos;s no more to you than a stray dog: he&apos;s tolerated, not welcomed.*
Did you hear? We&apos;re bringing you to Meistr Siva, the head of the Seekers! If... if we can get out of here, that is...
Stay away from the Magisters, brother. They killed that fellow back there. They&apos;ll hide the evidence well enough, but I know it all the same.
So... farewell. Oh - and take this. You&apos;ll make better use of it than I ever could.
*Step through the portal.*
The Silent One
[ELF] *Lean in close to catch the scent of the stone.*
*Say that this was the Black Ring&apos;s doing. He should make them suffer, the next time he crosses paths with them.*
*Given the content of this report, the Whites were keeping track of more than just Sourcerers and Paladins: they were building files on all of the Arx populace.*
Even without &apos;em, y&apos;can&apos;t let this place get to ya. You hear me? The Order might have your freedom for now, but you can&apos;t let &apos;em take your spirit, too.
Look out! LAVA!

*They chatter away for some time, using a guttural cant you struggle to understand. At one point, the man says something and looks over at you intently. Ifan waves his hand and laughs.*
You&apos;ve seen things that no one should ever see, my friend. But had you done nothing, the whole world would have seen that horror.
*Apologise, for you meant no offence. Offer her a little more.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
I don&apos;t trust that leak. I say flip the switch, send the Deathfog to the water, away from the city.
Forget the scar. Forget the names on my skin. And forget the instrument with which I kill.
This way. We&apos;ll get a new collar on you soon enough.
&lt;i&gt;We rise&lt;/i&gt;...

Kill it... if you can... I beg of you, Lohse...
Aye. Sometimes you make enemies jus&apos; by bein&apos; who &apos;n&apos; what ya are. That&apos;s all it takes. They&apos;ll hate you &apos;cause of the Source in ya, or &apos;cause you got scaly skin, or &apos;cause ya eat limbs...
Then back to usual for me. If you need healing or want to trade any goods, my door&apos;s always open.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him you are called not by name, but by title. &apos;Prince.&apos;*
&lt;i&gt;I KIIIIIIIILL YOU, SMALL-MEAT!&lt;/i&gt;
Hey! It&apos;s you. They told me you&apos;d mosey your way down here eventually.
*Tell her you have good news: the Knight of Duna is already dead.*
*Draw your weapon anyway - this isn&apos;t the time to be taking chances.*
S&apos;already in my pipe. Sorry. Or something. Just bugger off, like I said, will you?
*Say you have already encountered Isbeil - in the sewers.*
The scar.
We found Dorian&apos;s laboratory.
My patience is running about as thin as the ice you&apos;re skating on...
Do you know, lover, I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;want to go again? Come here!
Oh gods. Look... just go.
They will be at your mercy, which is vastly preferable to you being at theirs, wouldn&apos;t you agree?

*Your many years twinkle behind you like distant stars - tiny but beautiful. You smell wheat ale; you hear a chorus in a tavern. You feel joy.*
We lost the fight. If one of us wants to be champion, Murga must go.
*Squeak!* Nice to have some squeakin&apos; elves &apos;round here again! They always put on such a show at those big ol&apos; heads. KABOOM! SPLASH! SIZZLE!
You must learn your place after all, Sebille.
