This ceremonial wand is richly decorated, yet a dark reddish crust seems permanently embedded within the gravings that mark it.
&lt;i&gt;They cut me from the Ancestor Trees and reshaped me to their purpose. &lt;/i&gt;
Dallis would kill to get what she wants. Nice to have something in common.
Rhymes Of The Ranger, Part 1
Besides, slight&apos;s given where slight&apos;s needed! They sing the praises of the Reds they do! Bloody disgrace, I say.
Gaze into the gem, handsome one.

*Thank him for his time, but tell him you have no intention of giving him the tablet.*
Fresh air! &lt;i&gt;Freedom! &lt;/i&gt;There&apos;s no containing me &lt;i&gt;now!&lt;/i&gt;
RAT! SNAKE! WORM!
You have proven yourself to be worthy as my champion. May the armour shine with my pride.
*Express surprise. He was expecting you?*
He... he tried, at least. It failed. Miserably, in fact. The demon&apos;s never been stronger inside me...
A weighty academic tome on the most lethal weapon of our time: Deathfog
*Nod to the squirrel and take your leave.*
Kemm&apos;s Mansion
She&apos;s gone, Fara. GONE!
Indeed? Rhalic, if I&apos;m not mistaken. Always was rather the slow sibling in the pantheon, wasn&apos;t he?
*Praise her resolve. She has seen much tragedy in her years. This, too, can be overcome.*
Open your eyes, little man. Time to die.
*These ramshackle quarters have seen better days. You can make out the silhouette of Captain Sech Zapor, radiating disdain while stroking the buttons of his coat.*
More visitors than last year, I reckon. Brave of them to make the trip.
*Bow your head in thanks before you leave.*
We&apos;re both busy men. Why don&apos;t you get busy somewhere else, while I stay busy here?
Let Swann study the afflicted woman&apos;s remains.

For yourself and nearby allies, Dodging is increased by 90% and Movement Speed is increased by 1m.
*A wall of disdain near knocks you reeling - the Sallow Man&apos;s contempt hits you like a tidal wave. And then it passes... a woolly fog envelops your mind, telling you to choose the winning side.*
Someone has been interfering where they weren&apos;t invited. Someone has been behaving very, very foolishly indeed.
*The stag trophy stares outward with dull glass eyes. Inscrutable... and a little disquietening.*
Isbeil. The poisonous thorn in Queen Justinia&apos;s side. She is my enemy. And she is yours.
*Remark that he isn&apos;t the only Godwoken who could ascend - what makes him think he should be Divine, above all others?*
Hands off!
*The spirit of a Black Ring Initiate stands before you. He seems to be &lt;i&gt;smouldering &lt;/i&gt;- spectral ash and smoke drift away from him. He sighs at his incinerated mortal remains.*
Unleash an icy wind, freezing enemies in place and dealing [1].
*Peering down at you through glistening agate eyes, the stone gargoyle smiles. Its sharp teeth scrape over one another as it begins to speak.*
Vandalism has been a big problem lately. Have you been making a mess around here?
After all, I am an energetic, fresh-faced skeleton, teaming up with the Lady-turned-Goddess Amadia. What force could stop two Eternals?
Your poor taste in drinking partners does not interest me. These are no average cutthroats: they are the kind of creatures that grew bored pulling the legs off spiders and so moved on to people.
Kin! You speak to Xiuh, hatched from the egg of Zorrah. It pleases Xiuh to speak to lizards once more.
*Suggest you can offer another pair of eyes on the lookout.*
Oi! You look the kind of wench who can keep a secret. Fancy a good time? Head downstairs in the Black Bull tavern - tell the lummox blocking the way that Blaithin gave you a tip-off.
Damned rat. To think I used to pity her kind.
Speak with Jahan.
I can see the fire in your eyes. You think it a sun, but I know it to be but a single flame that can be doused with a single breath.
*Wonder if he has any idea how to escape the armour.*
Attack_Melee_Std_1
What a vile place that was. I&apos;m glad to see the back of it.
[LIZARD] *Say that you suppose he can be no other than the famed Red Prince, if such a thing is possible!*
Grrrrrrrrr...
You cause much grief. Saheila. Kuma. Silius. Mindaran. All the many others on your long lean arm: dead friends.
And burns still. My master&apos;s magic is powerful, and it will never fail. The chest sits, safely burning, until the eternal flames wither.
With a world full of Sourcerers, we should be able to make short work of the Voidwoken.
*She sits at full attention, utterly rapt in your retelling.*
Of course I am! I painted the greatest works of art that Arx has ever seen - &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian!&lt;/i&gt; My opinion is the only one that matters.
Delay Your Turn
Oh go on! Please! You may be creepy but you don&apos;t have to be mean as well!
Acquillah O&apos;Rorke
I intend to abide by it. That will have to do.
My tasty petal, I fear there&apos;ll be no next time. My princelings are hungry and mama must feed them. Oh, just &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; at that healthy flush in your cheeks...
Sure is. Shame to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Magister Vorrh
The Magisters will come back - evil always returns if it doesn&apos;t get its way.
We consumed the Captain&apos;s Source.
I&apos;ve a demon of my own, you see. One I&apos;ve been hunting for a long time, and now I&apos;ve managed to track him down to the island over yonder.
Yes. She is right - a name holds more power than most of us realise.
Hidden Wall
A hissing arrow packed tight with steam. This baby is ready to explode; shield your eyes as you nock and load.
Company. Wonder how they made it through.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Funny how&apos;s it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt;consulate that&apos;s burning, isn&apos;t it? Mark me - the Ancient Empire does not forget.
[1] new skills gained.
They do not earn the honour.
Blessed Electrified Steam
Did that cause a reaction?
She&apos;s &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;, damn you! Don&apos;t you understand?&lt;br&gt;
*Silently take your leave.*
My Prince! The Voidwoken tore down the consulate&apos;s barricades like they were paper. I pray you keep the Empire safe from their claws.
*Laugh in Alexandar&apos;s face. He really believes all this hogwash he spouts?*
*Say you haven&apos;t a clue who she&apos;s talking about. Who is the Red Princess?*
He&apos;s dangerous. We should kill him.
Heartsinker
She healed the sick and soothed the wounded; I saw it with my own eyes. I brought her close. Her words were wise, and her aims... well, they seemed so pure.
The session has no controllable characters available. Ask the host to free a character slot or recruit another character, then try joining again.
We met a Paladin wearing strange Elven armour in an underground laboratory. He attacked us.
*He leers at you. You feel his hate, his rage, his blinding thirst for blood. &lt;i&gt;Your &lt;/i&gt;blood. He reaches into your mind... and fails. He has no power now. The power is all yours.*
But... you mean...? Please, this isn&apos;t the time for foolishness! Gareth&apos;s out there still - he could be in danger!
I won&apos;t be party to this. It&apos;s suicide.
*The little girl giggles and runs back to join her friends, eager to play once more.*
No, today my death is not important. All that matters is that you find Malady and tell her the location of the Council. Just... be wary.
*The spirit ignores you, focused as it is on tearing the Source from its captive. It stinks of... dark magic.*
Durability
Elodi suggested that the elf Saheila may know how to escape the fort.
Small Bucket
*The brother scowls - he feels vindicated. His sister still does not agree. A life is not worth living if you do not stand up for what you believe.*
It makes sense to me. War was coming. Surprise was her only advantage.

*Tell him you&apos;ll be careful around the salamanders.*
But power changes a man, as he changes his nation. Braccus grew paranoid. Angry. Murderous.
Be ready. Lightning&apos;s soon t&apos;strike.
Had to open your big  mouth, didn&apos;t ya?
You started browsing online lobbies. Other local players will be disconnected.
Guardsman Mallic
Wait - there&apos;s a note in here.
We&apos;ve come this far together. There&apos;s no reason to turn against each other now. Not after everything we&apos;ve been through.
Tempest
Can&apos;t you tell when someone&apos;s trying to help you?
*Ask why the bull assumes you&apos;re headed for the tavern.*
*He lowers his sword, releases you from his grasp, and turns you to face him.*
*His pincers scissor wildly.*
You&apos;ve really got the nerve. You belong in prison, my friend!
Our desert meeting with Sadha ended in violence.
*The ground drifts by hundreds of feet below you. Droplets of your blood fall away from you into space. You don&apos;t feel any pain, only a numbing cold...*
*As the Source rises in your body, you feel your collar start to contract and burn.*
*Madness? What madness? Demand she tells you what&apos;s going on.*
*Dorotya sighs - a fusion of a kitten&apos;s purr and a cockroach&apos;s clacking.*
Oh... you know...
&lt;b&gt;AWAY! You have walked with one who is too pure - you reek of them. Away from us!&lt;/b&gt;
One Thousand Mice
*Tell her the Mother is already dead.*
*That&apos;s enough about trolls. Take your leave.*
*Drop the ruse and tell him the truth: You&apos;re a Sourcerer and you&apos;ve escaped from Fort Joy.*
Find the hidden vaults.
Here&apos;s hopin&apos; the Dwarf Queen won&apos;t fall for that nonsense. Criminy, if all the world ain&apos;t gone to rot!
*Say that that doesn&apos;t look like &apos;creation&apos; to you.*
*Press your lips against his. Turn this into a real kiss.*
*Your body convulses with Rhalic&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile grows at the sight of your agony.*
*Tell Marg you&apos;ll think about it. Take your leave.*
*Say you knew him indeed - knew him to be a madman and a deviant.*
Thank you. Good day.
Immunity to [1]&lt;br&gt;
You bet yer bouncy bippy. And jus&apos; wait until you hear what I call my beard!
*The urn thrums with soothing warmth as your pet companion plays nearby.*
Fopdoodle.
*Keep quiet and step towards the entrance.*
Charred Lizard Corpse
Sign
Keep out of it!
*Say that this place seems secure enough - he won&apos;t be missed.*
*You approach, but the Paladin&apos;s icy blue eyes never move from his prisoner.*
Enwebbed
*Laugh at its predicament and walk away.*
*Press for more information.*
As if I wanted it - I was transporting the damned thing on orders.
But that&apos;s not what I want to hear. That&apos;s not what I want to hear at all.
Mmmmmmmm...
*It&apos;s about time. Tell her you are ready to get out of this hellhole.*
My, you do drive a hard bargain don&apos;t you? Very well, consider yourself invited.
*Ask the rat if using magic on it wouldn&apos;t kill it.*
...Pfft, you give the giants too much credit, Quercus.  I think the salty air has addled your mind.
, &lt;br&gt;[1] from [2]
*Lohar&apos;s lips move as he reads through the note. After a moment, his lips go still and his face turns the colour of bone dust.*
[ELF] *Tell him he&apos;s not the only one upset about the Deathfog. &lt;i&gt;You&apos;ve&lt;/i&gt; got questions too.*
*Say you want to report a cache of Source weapons you found.*
*Shrug. Any more distinguishing qualities?*
These Godwoken are going to be the death of me.
*Tell her you&apos;re sure you have something in your pack that&apos;d suit.*
We appreciate your hospitality, esteemed Gratiana.
*Tell him you&apos;re just admiring his knack for getting things done.*
ACTIVATE
*Say that you don&apos;t believe him.*
But I held your blood! I HELD YOUR BLOOD! Thief! Liar! &lt;i&gt;DEFAULTER!&lt;/i&gt;
You have no right to take that!
