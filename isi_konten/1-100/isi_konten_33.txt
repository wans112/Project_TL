[BARBARIAN] *Glower. Do you seem like the type that enjoys &apos;tricks&apos;?*
*Without another word, he wanders away from you, deep in thought.*
The Lone Wolf mercenary Ifan ben-Mezd joined me on the Lady Vengeance. He&apos;s keen to find out why his pack are hunting Godwoken.
*Nothing happens. The spirit darts its eyes about, all the more tortured by its failure to return home. It is trapped. Is this be Ryker&apos;s doing?*
*Speaking with her fills you with distaste, but she may yet be useful to you. Change the subject.*
Arx has had a few knocks lately, but I&apos;ll wager it&apos;s still grander than whatever forest you came from, elf.
*Cough* It doesn&apos;t do to panic here. Believe me.
*Say that&apos;s fine by you. Goodbye and good riddance!*
A possessed maniac. Double points.
Exploded Cadaver
Welcome! What brings you by?
Aye, ma&apos;am.
*Take your leave.*
I&apos;d rather it hadn&apos;t happened this way.
Now there&apos;s a sight for sore eyes.
Right now, everything&apos;s so uncertain. Maybe when this whole Void thing is past us, when we&apos;ve done what we need to do...
Dancing with the Wicked
A Dreamer, my prince. The greatest Dreamer of them all! He was waiting for you here, but... but...
Non-teleportable
*A pressure builds in your chest cavity. Cold air wafts through your bones. And a voice within warns you to leave this spirit unharmed.*
Back in the war, I never got the point of these things. They&apos;re &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; broken...
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry to hear about his buddy and his cargo, wish him luck, and take your leave.*
Increases the base maximum Action Points of hero characters to 8.
I failed them.
May as well get to it, then.
*Shrug. That murderous little boy had earned his cage.*
Soon as they touched that switch they... they were screaming. Some Void curse. Dallis warned us to take care, but I... we never thought... never knew...
Stay&lt;i&gt; silent&lt;/i&gt;, lizard!
*Her cold eyes grow a shade colder.*
We removed the magical barrier.
*Say that you&apos;ll think of something.*
[HUMAN] *Tell him that humans are by far the greatest lovers.*
[1]% chance to turn water surfaces and clouds into blood
*Nod and take your leave.*
*You are suddenly heavy on your feet. The air here feels weighted with import - and dread. All light within you feels suddenly dimmer.*
No matter, our master was clear: none shall pass.
*The animals argue on.*
*Smirk. &lt;i&gt;What if you are?*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the Magister to call off their search - the chef is the real murderer!*
Away! &lt;i&gt;Away! &lt;/i&gt;Too noisy! It&apos;ll come back - it&apos;ll take me too...
*Note that he makes frequent glances at a parchment he carries. What&apos;s written on it?*
*Say you have business that doesn&apos;t involve the gods, the Meistr, or even Malady.*
Any word, love?
It is only natural, undeath can feel rather lonesome, but you must be wary. Some of these creatures are more dangerous than they seem.
Squee squee squee squee!
*Demand to know how she survived. If everything descended into war, how did she end up in this cave?*
Wooden Staff
Waypoint Shrine
We were cast out of the dream after devouring the Dreamer&apos;s spirit. There is no way to return and face the dragon.
A simple pendant, unremarkable save for the cheery twinkle that glitters within the inlaid stone.
I wuzzz hungry.
*To hell with him. Lunge forward, drawing your weapon with one quick, fluid motion.*
BOCK! Our baby is gone, our baby is gone...
*Continue to listen, calmly, neither resisting nor giving in to the song.*
*Wave your arm and tell him to go ahead.*
[1] gives you [2]% extra chance to evade hits.
Pity. I see something... special in you. But Lucian had no patience for cowards - and neither do I. Prove your mettle, or don&apos;t. Only one path leads to your salvation.
*Stay silent. The ritual must be completed if you are to meet your destiny.*
*Ask who he means. What enemy?*
What? No. No!
*Lean in for a kiss.*
Since I&apos;m the champion of the arena, Nebora the Blacksmith might remove my collar for me.
Oh... oh no. You spoke to her? Face to... whatever you call the odd, frontly-part of your person? I regret to inform you you haven&apos;t much longer to live, then.
Spirit of a Fearful Dwarf
You! I know what you are up to, thief. And you&apos;re not getting away with it!
Well fought.
You... you&apos;re like her. A witch. A &lt;i&gt;witch!&lt;/i&gt;
We part ways now. I&apos;ll... remember this moment.

Someone was hurt. You didn&apos;t do it, did you?

You can&apos;t silence me! GUARDS! GUARDS COME QUICKLY! There&apos;s a Sourcerer in my cell! She&apos;s unlocked the door! GUARDS! Why isn&apos;t anyone coming... I&apos;m being good! I&apos;m being GOOD!
Aye, Braccus&apos;d see us made emperors before he throws that much Source away.
Self-Made Bow
You have?! Quickly, where is he?
The Lost Knight
Good boy.
The Queen is dead. May her successor serve their people, in prosperity and in peace.
Curious Angelic Statue
Door
Remember what I said. Become the best at what you detest, and you control it.
Maybe you&apos;ll find &apos;em again, after all this is over.
&lt;i&gt;We... are... ETERNAL!&lt;/i&gt;
Effie
These boots are fortified with steel toes, somewhat rusted now from Braccus Rex&apos; burial at sea under the hands of Source Hunters.
Deep underground, we came across an undead knight. We promised to release his soul from a jar, and he told us of a way out of Fort Joy.
But... You&apos;re... afraid?
*She gives your arm a vigorous stroke of the tongue; efficient, like a cat grooming.*
And? I&apos;m a busy man, Marcus. I&apos;ve... I&apos;ve got business concerns all over the Coast and well beyond. They don&apos;t concern you.
Say my name! &lt;i&gt;Say my name! SAY MY NAAAAAAAAAME!&lt;/i&gt;
Intention is worthless when actions cause harm! All I asked was to be left in peace...
Shackles of Pain Skillbook
We both deserved better...
Maybe we can help each other out - we stick together until we get to safety, and you can count on my bow if we run into more Black Ring.
Hellsworn
Surely not! Even you can benefit from my... research. It&apos;s not just decomposing flesh and bone dust underfoot, you know. Why, the very essence of decay flavours many an essential oil and tincture.
Bye!
*Tell them you quite understand. Wish them the best of luck.*
*Envisage &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;knife tapping on &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;ribcage.*
I told you the Paladins were useless. Was someone else that cleared out the consulate!
And who might you be?
You... you, you, you, you... quite lost. Quite lost, quite lost... careful or they&apos;ll CROSS YOUR WIRES! Heehee!
Delorus is a fool. Went and got himself caught, and now he&apos;s handing out our secrets to any old elf who happens to stalk by.
You confronted your demons, in turn to confront Divinity itself. A rather poetic arc, don&apos;t you think?
Skullcrusher
Bronze Ring
Warm Temple
*Urge Gareth to lower his weapon. He must overcome his cruelty and rage.*
Captain&apos;s Jaunty Hat
The big acorn has come from the sky - it will wash away our enemies in one big blood wave! ALL HAIL THE ACORN!
Prowlers
What?! This world has been inflicted on me! I cannot help it if your barbaric culture does not yet appreciate me.
The Gods suddenly seem a lot less godly when you can bump into their kinfolk at the bottom of a cave...
Well... some areas of study are best enjoyed in private, away from prying eyes and &lt;i&gt;under-developed &lt;/i&gt;intellects...
[OUTLAW] *Nod and say &lt;i&gt;&apos;ave grik layal&apos;:&lt;/i&gt;  old tongue for &lt;i&gt;&apos;the darkness knows the night&apos;.&lt;/i&gt;
Lone Wolf leader Roost Anlon is holed up with his band in a nearby sawmill. He&apos;ll know who ordered Sahelia&apos;s death.
Team [1]
Shame. A quick end would be a mercy.
Consider in your heart if you can truly ascend while corruption eats at the heart of the Council.
*She slaps Sebille hard across the cheek.*
*Say you&apos;re afraid your heart wouldn&apos;t be in it.*
[Character hasn&apos;t recovered after previous death.]
*Tell him if you&apos;ve killed another Godwoken.*
*Implore her to back down. You don&apos;t wish to fight. You wish to talk.*
The old band back together again, hmm? I guess that depends, doesn&apos;t it.
*Say you&apos;d like to talk about what happened during the exorcism.*
Not if yer wivout sin, it isn&apos;t.
I&apos;ve had more bouts o&apos; scabies than baths in this place, y&apos;know. Still, at least the sun&apos;s a-shinin&apos;, ey?
*Prod him along. What did the notes say?*
*Confirm that you learned Deathfog had fallen into the hands of the dwarves while you travelled along Reaper&apos;s Coast.*
*You can tell how much this means to him. Tell him to go ahead.*
Lady Kemm has been kind enough to host me until I can return to the kingdom. I vow to take greater care in whom I trust. I must seek to avoid further tragedy than we have already seen.
How could you let them get her?
*Ask her what she makes of Saheila&apos;s words.*
Superconductor Skillbook
Thank you sso muts. Much. I ow you eferythink.
We chose what was right. I pray you do the same.
*Tell him you&apos;re here to discuss the Godwoken contract, in a manner of speaking.*
Well then I definitely don&apos;t want &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;hanging around! Everybody out! Troll time! Kill this weirdo!
Look, I&apos;m a simple man.
*Reprimand the rat, saying that he&apos;s disrespecting the dead.*
*Stingtail stands before you a broken mess, quivering with fear and pleading miserably to spare his life.*
Pyroclastic Eruption
A most warm welcome. May my elixirs ease your burdens.
Wordless Aura
Breaking rocks or breaking legs; it&apos;s all in a day&apos;s work for a humble pickaxe.
We were... naive. We needed a Godwoken to ascend, and we assumed that a Godwoken would merit ascension. Our error cost us dear. Many died. But the Mistake did not ascend. For that we can be grateful.
Leader
*He inhales deeply over the stew, savouring the scent of it, then scoops up a large chunk of meat and swallows it down, seemingly without chewing.*
[LOHSE] *Take him by the hand and wish him the best of luck.*
Magical inclinations? Come closer, I say!
You remember what happened to the elves, don&apos;t you? Ain&apos;t no-one left standing when you treat &apos;em to Deathfog! You&apos;re lucky to be so far from home and no mistake!
*The demon is gone! Ask her how she feels.*
*Produce the Dwarven Queen&apos;s letter from your pocket. Show him the seal, but hold it out of his reach.*
*Consume his Source and cast his soul into the Void.*
Ah. You have meant so much. Too much. You are&lt;i&gt; theirs &lt;/i&gt;now. The people&apos;s. You can&apos;t be mine too.
We&apos;re people.
Changing races are not available for origin characters.
We always knew that good men make enemies. We knew evil would come, and so it did. Not demons, not witches, but shambling husks. If they came with others, we never saw them.
Void-touched Deer
Of course I am, Susan dear.
A visitor? How &lt;i&gt;quaint&lt;/i&gt;. A companion of yours visited me before; did you too bring a delicious hostess gift, hmmm?
*Admire the armour. What makes it so special?*
Fill &apos;er up!
You&apos;re under arrest, then. Come with me, Sourcerer.
*Ask if she knows why she was taken her captive.*
We thank you again. We bless you again. The wealth of the depths is yours.
Don&apos;t come back!
*Pain flashes across his face. That hurt.*
A sweet thing to say, but I know the truth. It&apos;s jus&apos; - jus&apos; that I didn&apos;t always feel anyone was ever listenin.&apos;
*A face swims in and out of your vision - she has hidden her friend&apos;s identity well, you cannot make her out... but there! A glimpse of someone you have met, not he but she...*
