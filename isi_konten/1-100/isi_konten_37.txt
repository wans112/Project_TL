*There is a blinding flash and you are surrounded by flame. It licks your skin, enveloping you, but does not burn. Looking up, you see Zorl-Stissa sitting on an ember throne, surrounded by faintly glowing stars.*
Wait. Where the hell did that Dorian fella go?!
*He thinks for a moment.*
*Tell her you&apos;re a proud kin of the Ancient Empire.*
*Too late, he realises what you&apos;re about to do - *
Spirit of a Pianist
Warning
Ah, there you are.
*The Prime Scion? Ask Sebille what she&apos;s talking about.*
Is there? Wherever do you keep it?
*Insist that it is only through human might that Rivellon can find peace.*
*The kid is whistling an off-key tune as he strolls about shiftily. He raises an eyebrow at your approach but says nothing.*
No sign of stolen goods here.
Switch between Debug parties
Let&apos;s make the time to check out that house of Mordus&apos;, too. Ain&apos;t solvin&apos; my own mystery until we solve Lohar&apos;s.
Well, I don&apos;t feel like arguing about it. Just keep your nose clean.
&lt;i&gt;Do as I do, Lohse.&lt;/i&gt;
Do it, or don&apos;t. I will see justice done.
*Appeal to his compassion. This fugitive is as good as dead unless someone steps up.*
&lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
Not so fast, ben-Mezd and pals. Just because I&apos;m smiling... it don&apos;t mean I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;happy&lt;/i&gt;.
*Consume Taryan&apos;s Source.*
Strip.
Attaboy. And you can drop the haunted look, you&apos;ve killed innocents before. Now look here on this map...
Confirm
Oh, shite.
*Point out that you&apos;re a stranger here - you have no reason to lie to her.*
The world is ours once more. Now we shall end the reign of thieves and enslave these so-called &apos;races&apos;.
Before I let you go however, there is one more matter we must touch upon. You are travelling... with company, yes?
The good ship Merryweather. But you can stand at ease there, private. You do realise you&apos;re not in the army here, don&apos;t you?
Just a second.
*Ask where he&apos;s heading.*
Tell me. Is this all there was? There weren&apos;t any other... curios in there?
A vial of blood labelled &apos;Red Prince&apos;
We can&apos;t afford to lose our leader... and I don&apos;t want to lose a friend.
Intercepted Missive
Sleeping Arms
[ELF] *Ask about the elf who was the subject of the burial ritual - what happened to them?*
More talk? I always preferred the chatter of my eagles to the empty gab of people. Birds are truly the chosen species of the gods.
Perhaps if your precious &apos;Lucian&apos; had been a little less mortal, you would still have a Divine and the Voidwoken would not be trying to chew on my bones.
*Wonder how he brought the puppet to life.*
any
*Ask to know more about this &apos;internment fee&apos;...*
Unlock one, lock the other. Not the cleverest of magic. Irritating, though.
The Paladins kept the prisoner in an inner chamber, locked in a magical cage.
Roank
Charm
Explode, dealing [1] in a large area around you, creating a Cursed Oil surface.
*Stare in horror. &lt;i&gt;She&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;responsible for the Magister&apos;s purging wands?*
*Tell the creature you can&apos;t help him. He needs to leave you be.*
Oh, gods. Divine alive, it&apos;s&lt;i&gt; planning &lt;/i&gt;-
*Dripping with liquid Source, this barrel is sealed and marked with a cross. From the barrel you sense... a familiar power. It thrums in your bones. In your &lt;i&gt;soul.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Admit he has a point.*
Rejoice, kin. The Mother is gone. We are free.
We tried to trick the Weaver. It tried to kill us.
And stop wasting my damn time.
*Tell her you want more.*
Destroy [1] on targets in a cone, and set Acid and Atrophy.
*Meet her eyes in silence and wait for her to greet you.*
*Threaten to smash his soul jar to pieces if he doesn&apos;t free you and hand over what he has of the armour.*
Use to read.
The Advocate offered no help in our quest to master our Source.
Hold up now... there&apos;s a note in here.
I&apos;ve always known I was destined for greatness. To be Godwoken though, that I did not quite see coming.
You are quite formidable, Beast, but you underestimate just how much more formidable you could be!
All those souls lost, and for what? A chance - and not even a sure chance - of besting a demon. I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s right.
Arx - City Square
What end? He has me, now; he has me forever. I&apos;ll never be free of him.
*Pretend that your spirit is troubled. You struggle with understanding... perhaps you could avail of her wisdom?*
Narrator
I am the Prime Scion. I am the Mother to be. I must do right by my people.
&lt;i&gt;Our people are scattered, but I will gather them. You are the first.&lt;/i&gt;
A &apos;meowntain&apos;. &apos;Meowntain&apos;. As in &apos;mountain&apos;.
Hmm... you look a little bit elfish. Maybe your daddy was an elf. My daddy&apos;s name is Freder. He&apos;s waiting for me at home. I&apos;ll go home soon.
Bloodied Bowl
Dragonclaw
It doesn&apos;t even hop down to see the b-b-bodies...
We&apos;re ready to leave for the Nameless Isle. At the Council of Seven lies the Well of Ascension - and destiny. We must inform Malady we are ready to leave.
[SCHOLAR] *Mord&apos;Akaim? That ritual is older than time - blood magic with the power to decimate armies.*
Oops.
Rhalic told me to seek Divinity myself. I&apos;ll not hand it over to Alexandar.
All that matters now is gettin&apos; to Arx and stoppin&apos; that bomb. Lives are at stake.
*She cringes at the name and turns to you, urgent...*
Slots
These people were slain by blades, not Voidwoken...
Wyvlia, the cook at the Black Bull, has been murdering Magisters. We promised to keep her secret. Perhaps we could do more to protect her.
Every breath you take is a Godsdamned sin!
*Say you want to know how to set her spirit free.*
My darling miss.
Eep? Eep eep eep?
Why won&apos;t you s-i-i-i-ng?
The usual way. Haphazard, terrifying and drenched in blood. Haven&apos;t quite worked out the details yet, but I&apos;d wager it&apos;ll be no worse than what&apos;ll happen if we stay put.
*He offers her something round and slippery, like a wet, white marble in the palm of his hand.*
*Tell him he shouldn&apos;t forget he too was instrumental in defeating the God King.*
Receive Sparkstriker status. This causes your melee attacks to create a Spark projectile that bounces off the initial target to hit the closest enemy.
We met Eithne, an undead librarian. She&apos;s looking for a book on how to make corpses explode.
Knight of Rhalic
*Give in to her for just a moment... just to see what it might be like...*
*Hand over the goods.*
*Ask what the smelly person smelled of.*
That other pipe leads to the sea! Redirect the flow - it&apos;ll minimise the harm.
Decaying Touch
Your party will be teleported to the Arena now.
Angelic light reflects the etchings on the hilt of this hand-wrought sword. The Ancient Rivellonian letters glow whenever the blade strikes evil, for this is Voor d-Aravel: the Bane of the Void.
*Take the dwarf&apos;s advice and take your leave.*
&apos;Sides, you&apos;re bound to stir up some trouble over there. Ought&apos;ta be good fun.
It seems we are all facing a brave new world.
[VILLAIN] *Ask if it was he who sent the explosive toys to the wedding. Tell him you liked it. You liked it a lot.*
Decomposing Ranger
You&apos;ve won nothing. You learn nothing. You who are not fit to judge, you earn nothing.
Still. Beats counting sheep to pass the time, I reckon.
Something very bad has happened in the harbour.
I have not. But I do know that the stars that shine brightest often fade the quickest. Whatever pain burns in your chest, you will always have a home here.
Though I must say - I&apos;m surprised you haven&apos;t tried to kill me yet. After all, that&apos;s what Dorian is paying you for, yes?
Dune
*Turn away.*
There is little to tell. He&apos;s just the Doctor. He speaks to few, and few wish to speak of him, unless they&apos;re desperate. No-one even knows his name.
Summon becomes immune to Water damage. Also grants Steam Lance and an additional Hydrosophist skill (depending on summon).
Looks like it could be pork meat... or is it wollock?
Keep your distance, halfie. Any false moves and I&apos;ll lay you out next to that elf.
Don&apos;t just teleport away from me when I&apos;m speaking to you!
*The vision slowly fades and you are back in the temple, the smell of damp death filling your nostrils. You see that a crude sun pictograph has been hacked into the altar&apos;s rock*
You&apos;ll... you&apos;ll h-have to pardon me. Plenty to do &apos;round here, isn&apos;t there. Plenty to do, and no-one to do it with. Plenty to do, and no-one to do it with...
[JESTER] *Giggle. His bark was worse than his bite. Get it? Get it?*
*Raise your weapon. Does he need help finishing the job?*
It&apos;s a thinker of a poem, I guess.
Lord Arhu is missing, his quarters ransacked. We should look for clues.
Magister Pearst
*Say whatever it is, the answer&apos;s yes.*
Spirit of Victor Flynn
Very well. If you will not protect this town, then I shall.
It hasn&apos;t stopped me from thinking it&apos;d be a good idea to travel together. Whaddya say?
Skull with Candle
*Prod him to regale you with another tune.*
*The world is full of humans more capable, more experienced. Wonder why he chose you.*
Your choice. Door&apos;s over there. Convention says you go up alone. Best of luck to ya.
Shush it, hound.
I&apos;m not that kind of businessman!
*You strike the word through. Dragging the needle across it like a knife, you drown the black ink in blood.*
*She turns and gestures to the scene behind her. Down below you can see the six other Gods fighting, clawing at each other, every one desperately trying to get the upper hand.*
But I do have to add:
My thanks to you and your friends! I had never died before.
&lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Split&lt;/font&gt; the party by dragging their portraits away from one another, breaking the chain that connects them. Create &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;groups&lt;/font&gt; in your party by dragging those portraits together.
Chew Toy
*Ask him what he&apos;ll do now.*
Thing is, I can never be free. So I must choose the dwarven people&apos;s liberty... in exchange for my own.
Trousers
What&apos;s done is done. That&apos;s all.
House Interior - Estate A
Dorian Gall has vanished.
It&apos;s working!
Craddleson&apos;s Silly Book of Blanks
*The dwarf grunts, suspicious eyes peering out at your from under a canopy of eyebrow.*
Nice to see the cub has some claws. You drew blood, enough to know you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;...
Rendezvous with the Shadow Prince.
Further come and I&apos;ll knock the head in! Doing what&apos;re you here?!
Quercus! What are you looking at?
Bock! BOCK!
Key to Lizard Consulate Common Area
But now you are here. The Mother forgives. It is time for you to fulfill your destiny.
*Tell her you must take your leave.*
Camera Right
Enable this to synchronize save games with your Steam account.
There&apos;s a Sourcerer somewhere in this worm-ridden dump. Have you seen him? Grey cloak? Grey beard? Satchel of books?
No.
It&apos;s over. It&apos;s over. My soul is... is...
Dark magic and treacherous cunning defines the infamous dwarven crime lord Lohar. Where will he appear, and what form will he take?
Get outta here, ya dirty mutt!
*He works fast, checking weapons to see if they&apos;re battle-ready. He thumbs the edge of a blade. It draws blood. He grins.*
*Say it does indeed. If she&apos;s in control of herself, you should journey together again.*
Immortality is only permanent, my dearest prince, until one day it simply ceases to be.
*You strike a duel pose with composed elegance. All of him becomes malice.*
*Ask if you can be the troll&apos;s friend too.*
