This woman speaks truth. Boy, I&apos;ll let the rest of you live. But you&apos;re gonna do me a favour. You&apos;re going to tell your friends, and your neighbours, and every stranger you meet about this day.
*You might as well. You draw her close. You coil in sleep.*
Now, if you could help them sort out the small matter of getting out of here, we can be on our way.
Sloppy Blouse
Brahmos even haunts my nightmares, it seems.
*Ask why he is here. What&apos;s so important about this island?*
Where is it, where is it! Sir! Please, have you seen a small, burlap pouch lying about?
*After a few moments, her panicked breathing slows. She gets back to her feet with all the makeshift dignity she can muster.*
Friend! Sourcerer! You can&apos;t know my joy in seeing you before me.
In a fit of rage, she threw it into the sea.
Strike Terror Into Their Hearts
I&apos;m scared. I&apos;m not myself anymore. I... I have these cravings... I can&apos;t be trusted!
*An ancient curse escapes from her lips, spoken so forcefully that for a brief moment all light recedes into the webs of darkness.*
Bottle of Beer
[SCHOLAR] *Proclaim your understanding. She means Amadia, the Goddess of wizards.*
*Nod. You want a fresh start. You want to be done with the past.*
Ancient Key
Sliding Wall
*Suddenly, he smiles, expression thawing to something approximating warmth. He reaches out and squeezes your shoulder.*
Decency, eh? Oh, I had me some decency. Back in the day. Days before the Reds. Days of the Divine. Long gone.
*The grieving spirit heaves and sobs - but still manages a wan smile as you approach.*
*He smiles flatly and replies through gritted teeth.*
F19
Easier said than done, Ada.
You&apos;ll see, you little so-and-so. This isn&apos;t over.
Heh. Poor Gareth. The Order was never for him. His conscience is too strong. He&apos;d rather be&lt;i&gt; good &lt;/i&gt;than &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
Do not mock me, masked one. You know what lies beneath. But I will not allow you another step closer, human. Qanna&apos;s already laid claim to it.
Murder most foul! And I strongly suspect you know all about it!
Deep down everyone wants to be a good girl. You&apos;re a good girl good girl good girl. If you want to be.
Wipe that look off your face, Tatcher. It&apos;s still not worth getting sent to Fort Joy, I&apos;m telling ya.
True Brew: Jellyroom
*Note that he&apos;s quite brave, to look upon his own body when it&apos;s in such a condition.*
*Turning from you, he crouches back to the dirt. He resumes tracing esoteric sigils, his fingertips swirling through the graveyard clay.*
Save Campaign As
But his is not a treasure of gold, ruby and sapphire: it is a treasure of death. Weapons and vile magic.
*The spirit&apos;s chest heaves in short, hard bursts; its face is pinched into a tight sneer, fists balled up at its sides.*
Outcast Man
Equip: [1] Action Point(s)
Whether they &lt;i&gt;catch &lt;/i&gt;me is another matter. But I ain&apos;t one to hide my accomplishments.
Keep this... &lt;i&gt;ugliness &lt;/i&gt;to yourself; I wouldn&apos;t want it thought that we Magisters can&apos;t solve our own problems without throwing gold about...
Ah... and Ifan ben-Mezd too! Back in Fort Joy I wasn&apos;t quite sure but it really is him, the poor gods-cursed soul. Bravest man I ever met, now fallen so low.
Distinctive Farhangite
We read a book detailing a case of demonic possession. It noted that the demon inhabiting the victim was a creature that fed on pain - attempts to exorcise it only served to nourish it while causing great agony for the victim.
Find the Elven Scion.
*You&apos;re standing in the Academy! But where you saw a cold, broken ruin, this place feels warm and welcoming. It feels like home.*
Dungeon
Dragon Die
...and I know you&apos;ll do it with style.
*Say he&apos;s going to get himself killed. His mother would want him to go somewhere safe.*
Oh. So.
*Offer a prayer for Lucian&apos;s return.*
Hmph. Give me one good reason why I should believe you.
I WON&apos;T DO MUCH SNEAKING WITH THIS IN MY POCKET!
[FANE] *Say it&apos;s hard to believe oneself a god locked in eternal darkness.*
*Walk over to your desk and try to wave your hand through it.*
*A shrill voice echoes inside your mind. Over and over it screams &lt;i&gt;&apos;You will not die here! I will not permit it!&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Good. You haven&apos;t crossed mine either. &lt;i&gt;Yet&lt;/i&gt;.
Lord, please lord, spare me, spare me - it is too much, I hurt too much...
Aargh...
Keep Lucian close, Godwoken.
I don&apos;t suppose any of us did.
Playing this delightful little lute will heal everyone in the vicinity.
*Curiously ask what he&apos;s doing.*
May the spirit of the One be upon you.
*You can&apos;t afford that much.*
Disappointed that I did not take root, Saheila told me to seize Divinity for the good of all elves.
The Scroll is locked in my desk, on the second floor. The password is &apos;Giyora&apos;.
*Ask the question burning in your mind: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Why?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Realise that this is one result of the horror of the Voidwoken. Sympathise.*
We found an ancient lizard songbook in Dallis&apos; cabin. Within is a song of control.
*Proclaim that you are nobility, and will not entertain such frivolity.*
Tryin&apos; times. You understand. Can&apos;t afford to waste time on Johnny Know-nothing.
*Express your surprise. How is it he is here?!*
Lohse&apos;s story isn&apos;t over yet; I&apos;ve got to defend her.
The Void creeps ever closer, my child - even here, even in the Hall of Echoes, I cannot be sure I am safe.
Well, I think our work here is done, Quercus. Even if it isn&apos;t appreciated.
*You wish you&apos;d paid more attention to your tutors - you recognise the language but you can&apos;t make out a word!*
You sound just like that snake Jeth. You stop it with that sort of talk, you hear me? Such utter nonsense...
NO!
&lt;i&gt;Let us be rid of the God King.&lt;/i&gt;
Mystical Small Frost Rune
*In a stern voice, order the chest to open.*
*Insist that he shows far too much loyalty to Magisters, given that they abandoned him.*
*Point out that Lucian&apos;s plan has failed - the Void is here, and it looks like it&apos;s winning. He can&apos;t remain bound to an oath foisted upon him in bad faith.*
I bet if I could see your face, you&apos;d look incredibly pleased with yourself. But you shouldn&apos;t. You&apos;re too quick to act, too green still. It was there for the taking - and you couldn&apos;t do it.
*Agree to come back and spill the beans.*
*Explain that her father had him killed. Her husband was trying to betray the family.*
Even without my guidance you have become a true Master of the Source. You are ready, my child, and I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have something else to teach you...
Painting
Jules is a fine shot... I&apos;m sure Gareth would&apos;ve approved...
I look forward to turning you in.
[MYSTIC] *Note that colour can represent the elements - red for life, black for death, blue for the air.*
*Say you&apos;ve had no luck, and step away.*
The more he talks, the deeper he digs his own grave.
Sapphire Amulet
A weighty tome depicting the atrocities suffered by the elves during the war between the Divine Order and the Black Ring.
*Wonder who would buy such foul-looking fish.*
Silver Cup
*Tell her this spell doesn&apos;t sit well with you at all. It is a force of destruction, not creation.*
Effie
*The urn throbs in time with your grief, and thrums into a heartbeat: the familiar languid &lt;i&gt;ba-thum-ba-thum-ba-thum &lt;/i&gt;of Black Cat.*
*Take your leave.*
*Nod and say that&apos;s exactly your point. They&apos;re the elite - if he was here they would &lt;i&gt;surely&lt;/i&gt; have found him by now.*
I believe in you. I hand-picked you among all my beloved kin, because I trusted that you would succeed, if you chose it.
*He gives you a grim nod of acknowledgement, one fighter to another.*
Naught but a whelp in skilful hands, I&apos;m sure.
*Shake your head and take your leave.*
*Tell her you know &lt;i&gt;all about &lt;/i&gt;herself. Herself and Magister Borris, that is.*
Ah!
Who&apos;ll pay for all of this damage...? If those Paladins try to put another levy on my coffers, the Magisters will be the least of their blasted troubles!
*Ifan reaches into his tunic pocket and pulls out a strip of dried raw meat. He takes a tiny bite and offers the rest to you.*
Leave.
I suppose in the end I want more from life than to belong to a stale pantheon.
[ELF] *Sing to the statue an ode to nature. Perhaps it will acknowledge you.*
*The spirit&apos;s eyes and mouth narrow. In her silence, the noise of splashing sewer water bounces from the stony walls and into your ears.*
*He realises, to his surprise, that he holds the weapon in his hand, ready for battle. He smiles to himself, tucks the weapon away, and gets back to work.*
If just barely. Thank the gods - or... &lt;i&gt;whomever &lt;/i&gt;- for Malady.
Ya don&apos;t say? Well that explains why me bones ache and I&apos;m shiverin&apos; like a featherless chicken caught in a blizzard.
My eternal thanks, young one. O, timely death...
*Take a closer look at the combination lock.*
*Jahan composes himself, looks for a long moment at Lohse, rigid where she kneels, and strides toward you.*
Justinia&apos;s dead father. The shorter they come, the quicker they fall.
*Assure him there&apos;s nothing to worry about. You&apos;re quite alright.*
*Say you guess so. Ask if she remembers how you&apos;re supposed to get a move on from here.*
UI Select Slot0
Distinctive Whisperwood
Indeed? Hmm.
The Magister caravan held captive Sourcerers.
*He struggles to refocus and turns to look at you, but before he realises what&apos;s happening to him, it&apos;s already over.*
Spirit of Magister Pavlonia
Why, Isbeil, advisor to Queen Justinia, of course. A truly powerful agent of the Black Ring. You do not suppose Her Majesty has acted of her own accord, do you?
We&apos;ve become so much more together than we ever were apart. We stand at the edge of divinity itself. Hand in hand, we&apos;ll cross the ultimate threshold.
*Ask if she&apos;s tried using healing magic.*
Groate? I  don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any Groate. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
Did you kill all your demons?
Possessed Markswoman
*Say that actually, there is something else you wanted to talk to her about.*
Well done. &lt;i&gt;Very &lt;/i&gt;well done.
Not. Interested.
Another statue in the stonegarden. Nothing more, or less.
You&apos;ll do what? You&apos;re weak. Only we have the will to do what&apos;s necessary.
Poison Resistance
Hail, my friend! Do you have a moment? You know me - ever curious about your feedback on your experiences so far!
Lawre Godfray was my friend.
He&apos;s smaller than I&apos;d expected.
Look at that island, Quercus. Covered in forest - a true forest!
They started with my youngest. Henric... so full of life...
Karon has been here, no mistake there.
Well - not as ignorant as you look, are you? Yes, Marcus. The Order comes for the Kingdom, and so it must be silenced. It is the only way. The Deathfog will soon be released into Arx, and the Order cast into disarray.
Gems &amp; Jewellery
Promise me. &lt;i&gt;Promise me &lt;/i&gt;you&apos;d never unleash Deathfog.
Does this not give you pause?
Simply that to see the true beauty of a thing, sometimes you have to look at it as an outsider. As someone with &apos;fresh eyes&apos;, if you will.
*Say he&apos;s mistaken. You&apos;ll risk it.*
Ho! Not bad for bein&apos; off the top of my head!
This looks like the crate I&apos;m after... but where are the contents?
You are carnage and you are concord; the lord of war and lord of wisdom. You are lust and you are love: you are passion personified.
