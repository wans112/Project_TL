I&apos;m nothing if not a man of my word. And I did give my word I&apos;d set &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; free, lad. Say your prayers while you&apos;ve breath to speak them. The Halls await...
I suppose you&apos;re right. Alright then, you can pass. But I suggest you don&apos;t. I suggest you turn around and head another direction entirely.
*He looks like one would at a snail smeared all over the sole of one&apos;s boot.*
*Wait. Is he saying he was a serial killer?*
Berserk
That wasn&apos;t right!
*You start to speak, but it&apos;s too late. Zorl-Stissa breaks free, and the voice that emerges from your mouth is not quite your own.*
*You don&apos;t, but assure him that he&apos;ll know if anything comes up.*
Different Mod Settings
*An undead pirate gulps from a bottle, liquor spilling down his ribs. It settles in a dark, frothy puddle around his hipbones.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But very well, I&apos;m no stranger to parlour games. Let&apos;s see...
A perfectly ordinary arrow shaft. Combine arrow shafts with special arrowheads to create powerful arrows with special effects.
*As he listens, his face suddenly changes. Recognition dances into his eyes.*
Hammered metal seems a good choice for a second skull.
Incorrect. It seems that it was just blind luck that you stumbled upon my little book trick. A pity - I thought I had come by a kindred spirit.
Yet... *chuckle* old man Ros left the incident &lt;i&gt;quite &lt;/i&gt;unharmed.
Giant Magic Armour Potion
For the Love of a Red Lizard
And once it&apos;s strong enough, you&apos;ll be little more than a meat carcass for it to use however it pleases...
*Bid Gill a cheery hello.*
You will have your coin in full once I have the will.
*Look around warily and say you thought she was safe here from harm.*
*HNR!*
Your mistress should have enlightened you, thrall. The God King is the &lt;i&gt;true &lt;/i&gt;king. The so-called Seven Gods betrayed him and cast him down. Now it&apos;s time for him to rise again.
Sash of the Faithful
Bah! It&apos;s as if I never made myself a bed on his bony legs, or never chased away the mice that&apos;d bite through his books!
[SCHOLAR] *Peer beneath the bones and examine the soil.*
*He grins, and holds his hand towards you. You feel yourself... change. You feel a new self rising...*
Displacer Trap
An explosive filled with nails that do [1] and may inflict bleeding to everyone in a [2] radius.
Guardsman Stefano
Shh, lass. I know you&apos;re all a-fright. In times like these, I don&apos;t blame ya. But I ain&apos;t out to hurt ya. Now why don&apos;t you take a few breaths &apos;n&apos; tell me what happened?
Where is his head?! Where is his HEART?!
What? No - get away from me! Help - Help!!!
Why, our faithful little sloop of course. We can all ride together. Won&apos;t that be terribly &lt;i&gt;fun?&lt;/i&gt;
*The dwarf is examining one of the goblets, and carefully wipes a drop of wine from his finger as you approach. You notice that the green gems that covered the rings on his right hand are now all missing.*
Captain&apos;s Orders
Wonderful! And maybe I can make you even happier...
Solve the puzzle.
Taryan Graye
Dusty Pouch
Didn&apos;t they? After every choice we made together on this journey, &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;is where they drew the line?
You&apos;re confident, I&apos;ll give you that.
*Tell him it&apos;s just a bloody ring.*
We took Jonathan&apos;s ring as proof of his death.
Let sleeping dogs lie, let risen dead fly. Live and let live, I say.
Discuss the task with Malady.
To gain the Sallow Man&apos;s favour I must kill Alexandar.
*Tell her you noticed full well what she&apos;d done, but you figured she needed the gold.*
*As strong as Aetera was weak, the pedestal seems empty, as it if once supported something - something powerful; something now missing.*
&lt;i&gt;Unrest&lt;/i&gt;. The nerve of you. My boy Kniles would take exception with your talking to his mother that way. Luckily for you, he&apos;s off good-as-running Fort Joy!
*The expected happens: nothing.*
*Tell the Magister that you saw someone hiding in a barrel nearby.*
*His eyes snap open. He looks at you and frowns.*
Fool enemies into thinking you&apos;re dead. Cooldown of skills will be paused. Any action you take will cancel this status.
You&apos;ve got quite the violent streak. Let&apos;s put an end to it!
*Amid the squalor of this sanctuary you suddenly spot an elf with diamond features: regal and radiant, but cold too, and sharper than any knife.*
*Before you go on, ask who the prisoners in the cellar are, and why there are here.*
*He tosses a pouch of gold at you.*
Interesting. So I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; mistaken. Must have been ambition I smelled on you, not the magic that dare not speak its name...
*Shoot her a quizzical look. Isn&apos;t she a Sourcerer too? Isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;everyone &lt;/i&gt;in Fort Joy?*
By Lucian&apos;s sword, these Magisters are madmen! Are you alright, dwarf?
You&apos;re a really big kid. And really hairy...
[JESTER] *Tell him there&apos;s no need to be so gentle with the fish - they&apos;re already dead.*
A new Divine rose, a true heir to the Seven, more powerful than ever, and united Rivellon in its battle against the Void. All across the realm she was worshipped and adored. Humans, lizards, elves and dwarves all rallied to her banner. The great allegiance stood once more, but the war continued. From the depths of the Void, the God King still sought to return.
*The thing stirs deep within. It is pleased to hear your resolve, but Amadia&apos;s reaction is different.*
The Undead are considered abominations in Rivellon, an affront to the natural order whose mere presence invites violence. Those who walk among the living must do so masked.
Lemon
Red is the only shade that matters - life and death, true passion from within the artist...
Source, the very language of creation,
*With a blast the heat surrounds you. Flames dance across your vision... and the screaming... the screaming seems to fill your very existence...*
[SOLDIER] *Proclaim you bring word of war. Voidwoken roam Rivellon, and you are here to slay them.*
Nursery Rhymes
*Raise a brow. The spirits tell you he is no child, but a monster.*
*Their bliss turns to horror, and Raedalus turns to his sweetheart, telling her to flee...*
Is there more you need from me?
Timberwolf
Captain Ana Orell
You already know you&apos;re not welcome here. I don&apos;t warn you again.
*Say he should let you put him out of his misery.*
Talk to the figurehead if you don&apos;t believe me. That&apos;s always entertaining.
So much is lost. I wonder if it is possible. To rise again. To thrive again. Perhaps there is still time...
We read three books on philosophy. This might be enough to defeat Crispin.
These beings were wronged - they have a stronger claim to this world than we do.
Food: Bodyparts
More. It&apos;s... aware. I saw it growing from the corpses and it called to me.
[OUTLAW] *Say you are, and it takes a good thief to catch one.*
Those who work for a bounty&apos;ll never pull one over on those with a cause.
Master Thief
Arhu&apos;s chambers have been ransacked!
Fire Whip
*Glance at Lohse. Pity. But you can&apos;t be waylaid here much longer.*
Wine
I know... I know what they found there... I know what they did...
I&apos;d rather face my angry wife than give the likes of you the satisfaction of taking my dinner money. Keep the bloody ring, if it means that much to you.
Quality
Not bad. Took some time to think. I had a good friendship with Jonathan while it lasted. I&apos;d rather celebrate that than mourn what can never be.
Destroys [1] and then tries to set Sleeping.
The world won&apos;t mourn a few meatbags for long. I must be free of Mordus. He might cloak himself in skin, but his innards still rot.
*Justinia kisses his cheek.*
Free Amyro.
Like to take a look at what I&apos;ve been working on? Go on!
Siege Crossbow
Firewater&apos;s Staff
Wargs! Searle, watch out - &lt;i&gt;Get away from him, you foul creature!&lt;/i&gt;
*The dog is old and seems half-blind.*
Giant Fire Demon
These weathered leggings of Braccus Rex are encrusted with the spattered blood of those who died in an almost forgotten age.
I don&apos;t feel so good...

*Ask if you can try the peculiarly scented honey.*
We learned that Hannag had an apprentice, Gwydian. She lost contact with him while escaping from pursuing Magisters.
That amulet isn&apos;t yours! Help! &lt;i&gt;Thief!&lt;/i&gt;
We reached a floating temple high above the Nameless Isle.
We met a Sourcerer called Vasnya in the dungeons beneath Fort Joy who revealed the existence of some sort of hideout in another part of Reaper&apos;s Eye, beyond Fort Joy.
*Take pity on the creature. What can you do to help?*
*The great creature gives you an uninterested look, then turns away.*
Marg the Troll
Blackpits Cave Ruins
*The dwarf reaches into a barrel and pulls out a fish. His knife glides through the scales, crimson guts spilling out in its wake.*
*Gareth motions to you to take your place on the boat, and you take your first steps towards an uncertain future.*
On Source Orbs, Part 1
Acid Sparks
We mustn&apos;t linger in this vile place. There&apos;s not even a view.
*Speak boastfully of your days as a prison warden. The guard can go ahead; you&apos;ve got this.*
Masterful Assassin
*Two Paladins are arguing in front of the door to the modest farmstead. They notice your arrival, they stop talking and look at you quizzically.*
Divinity eludes you still, but I&apos;ve the feeling it won&apos;t elude you much longer. Think about what it means to become a god. Prove worthy of it.
We&apos;re still loading! Please try again later.
[IFAN] *Tell them to please excuse you. You&apos;ve suddenly remembered some, er, &lt;i&gt;critical&lt;/i&gt; business below decks.*
Kill! Kill! Kill!
My hounds&apos;ll love you. Dwarf meat is their favourite; they like the &lt;i&gt;stink &lt;/i&gt;of it.
I await but your word, Mistress.
Voidwoken Egg
It is a place of irony if you will: once the site of an academy dedicated to the art of demon hunting, now the remnant of a dream sliced open into nightmare.
Voyage to the Nameless Isle.
[SCHOLAR] *Say that you heard the lizards could use certain songs in their language in order to exert control over slaves...*
*Ask if he&apos;s excited for what comes next.*
UI Filter Elements
*You&apos;re much more interested in your own future. You hope he&apos;ll be part of it?*
Coffin
*Declare that you think he&apos;s hiding something.*
*A voice within suggests he just wasn&apos;t good enough - he didn&apos;t know enough, hadn&apos;t developed his powers as best he should, &lt;i&gt;wasn&apos;t ruthless enough.&lt;/i&gt; He failed because of himself.*
*Lay your hand upon his pate, and thank him for his... &lt;i&gt;contribution.*&lt;/i&gt;
[1] surrendered!
*Say he looks a little thin and give the dog a body part.*
I had a mask, rather ingeniously designed, which allowed me to take that primitive form.
Watch yerself, boy.
Crafted by Elves, the twigs and vines of this shield are so tightly knit that no spear can pierce through.
Roost Anlon told us that the Lone Wolves are making a fortune killing Godwoken.
Thankfully, I hold on to my keepsakes. Unlike my grudges.
So much &lt;i&gt;pain&lt;/i&gt;.
*Growl that you won&apos;t be denied.*
Rename Sticky
Welcome, Saviour of Saheila. Enter.
You. I know what you did, y&apos;know. Turned your back on me and gave that letter to the Reds. If I didn&apos;t already owe ya one, you&apos;d be in a heap on the floor.
Can you feel it, human?
I know you blame the gods. But what blame can the gods take for the actions of &lt;i&gt;men?&lt;/i&gt;
Blood Painting
