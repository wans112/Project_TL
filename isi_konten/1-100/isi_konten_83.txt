The harlot Gratiana, once she&apos;d had us flayed. She poured poisonous words into Braccus&apos;s ear until it wasn&apos;t enough to just kill us - he also locked our spirits away in Soul Jars.
[MYSTIC] *Reply that we are limited only by our imaginations. There are no outside bounds on where we might go or what we might accomplish.*
Fire up to three projectiles, each dealing [1].
You&apos;ll see; this is going to be the beginning of a whole new life for me. For &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;.
*The image quivers and shakes. The roar grows to a deafening cacophony, and the Sallow Man opens his mouth in a silent scream. He covers his head as the rocks start to fall...*
Arena Announcer
It was Griff&apos;s, now it&apos;s yours.
Have you forgotten your own journey, Marcus? I know you love your people. I know you would see them free. But I must be the one to face them. To release them from the prison I made for them.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him true love isn&apos;t unconditional. A cat gets that, a dog doesn&apos;t.*
We studied the mysteries of the universe. We created works of great art. We-... we disappeared.
Orange Juice

...strength comes...
Giant Insect Spawn
And you? What do you think about it? You gonna neutralise the threat? Shuck off the liability?
*He reaches out and takes your hands in his own, rough fingers caressing your wrists.*
*The spirit of a Paladin knight leans his head to one side - revealing the huge gash in his neck that nearly took his head off - and grins, a green glint in his eye. When he speaks he whispers...*
Pfsh. Give me one good reason.
It&apos;s not like Kemm to change his mind mid-execution. I just hope he made the right call.
Perhaps I can even offer some aid, if you&apos;ve the coin? Do you desire trinkets from the &lt;i&gt;ancients?&lt;/i&gt; For the smallest of costs, I tell you. Barely a trifle...
*Quick as a flash, the Watcher&apos;s jaw snaps tight on your finger like some kind of carnivorous plant. He gnaws experimentally, then spits you back out with no change to his expression in the slightest.*
He threw away his life because of a slight. Someone so thin-skinned should never have come to a place like this.
We shall burn the elven temple - &lt;i&gt;we shall burn it all! &lt;/i&gt;Then the God King shall reward us, and rise us up from the ashes.
Listen up. We can&apos;t win this one. But I can get us to safety. You&apos;ll need to buy me time.
Mmm. Oh yes. I have something that you want. But I only bargain with those I deem... deserving. Those who have accomplished great things. So tell me...
Polymorph Relinquished
*Give Beast a confident punch in the arm. He can stop the Black Ring - and you&apos;ll be there to help.*
It shall be done.
She&apos;ll be alright.

Sadha is safe, and with her, the promise of an empire!
*Ask her what she&apos;s seen.*
*The man hammers a nail into the side of a very large wooden box, each strike landing with dull thud.*
Have you done what I asked - and do you bring what I require?
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Godwoken.&apos; &lt;/i&gt;The word flutters against your ear. &lt;i&gt;&apos;You... are... my... champion! You... cannot... fail!&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*You recognise the dog from the town square in Driftwood. The wounds from his spiked collar are healing well.*
Your belly is as yellow as his, is it? Then I will bathe your bones in Alexandar&apos;s blood!
Your hunger will soon outweigh your all too delicate feelings.
*The reaver gives one last wistful look to the goblet, before letting it drop to his side.*
Ad&apos;Koshl
*Ask about her.*

I can&apos;t forgive him. And I can&apos;t forgive &lt;i&gt;myself &lt;/i&gt;for trusting him.
*The spirit squawks and flaps, trying to back away from your terrible presence.*
*Tell her your weapon is still wet with her blood, and an innocent girl is dead. You&apos;ll look at her however you want.*
Healing Ritual
*Step in from the shadows.*
Have you taken leave of your senses? You didn&apos;t help me!
Fighting Gloves
Despite all we&apos;ve been through, Fane stands against me. He insists that becoming the Divine is the only way to save his people.
Stand with Gareth.
Cluck, cluck clu - bock? CLUCKAW! BACAW!
*Sigh* Don&apos;t I know it.
*Suggest that it&apos;s a waste of time to look for petty criminals.*
Mistress is still trapped in a cage! Please help her!
[LOHSE] *Tell him there&apos;s something about it... something seductive and repulsive. You want to bury it in the garden and never look at it again... and you also kind of want to lick it.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast, abandoning Gwydian to his own devices.
Energy Staff
*Ask what &apos;gifts&apos; today has brought them.*
(My potion&apos;s starting to work, Mabel.)
I saw you fall. We all did. Thought you were done for.
I believe you. You don&apos;t intend to.
*Ignore the warning and ready your weapons.*
You&apos;ll realise that soon enough. I know you will. My bright, brilliant girl.
*She places a hand on her armour, eyes shut as if straining to hear.*
Still Water
Writ of Passage
*Roost shoves a large hand into a pouch in his belt and pulls out a dirty scrap of parchment. He glances at it, grimaces again, and shoves it back inside.*
A proposition, eh? Well - you didn&apos;t hear this from me, but if you speak to the cheese vendor, over by the Good Counsel School, she&apos;ll tell you what you need to know about these thieves of yours.
Tell Mumsy to come back soon!
Someone will come. I know it.
*She cocks her head to the side, as if listening.*
*Suggest that he should try to start a new life, away from the Magisters.*
*Say hello, and ask why she isn&apos;t at the cathedral to take part in the Endless Prayer.*
&lt;i&gt;He &lt;/i&gt;has faith in them, darling. That is all we need.
I have already unlocked a fraction of the tremendous power within you - but only a fraction.
*Question her assertion. Kemm is trying to destroy the Black Ring, not help them!*
Yup. There&apos;ll be Voidwoken here, alright.
*Remark that everything&apos;s a matter of gold, if the number is large enough.*
I hold your blood. No take-backs and no returns, and defaulters all... die. Thank you for your custom, please come again.
May the Voidwoken consume their joy, their misery!
*Tell the spirit that you&apos;ll go where you please.*
*This woman&apos;s worn out her welcome. Drain her Source and be done with her.*
Exploration Theme 11 Woodwinds
*Tell her... you&apos;ll see.*
What news? Can you channel enough Source? Are you powerful enough to proceed?
But - he&apos;s really nice - and tall! Maybe he can even help you with that thing...
As for you, you monstrosity, you were designed to be defective; you were built to die. And I rather think it is time you fulfilled your function. But do not fear, I shall put your Source to good use.
I&apos;m sorry, Jules... may you find rest...
Like I said, &lt;i&gt;I don&apos;t like the look of you&lt;/i&gt;. You&apos;re coming with us.
Young Han grew up a warrior and became one of the Alliance&apos;s greatest generals. But even he could not win the war.
Two-Handed Double-Headed Axe
*Ask about the prisoners in the cellar.*
In the meantime though, let us search for the Red Princess. I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; find her.
For a fourth time, the mysterious voice has spoken to me. It implores me to go to the sea.
After all that cock-and-bull about equity, Griff only wanted the supplies to ride the magic drudanae dragon.
You know, now that I think about it... Kristof was got rid of already, wasn&apos;t he? Who the hell are you then? Buvver off!
*Wonder what she&apos;d be willing to give for this book she seeks.*
We thank you for your co-operation. Be seeing you. Try to stop falling in love with the marks, Zee, it&apos;ll be the death of you.
Meat Cleaver
Find out who broke Gareth&apos;s Source collar.
*She opens her mouth to speak, but something happens. Her face droops and her eyes turn black.*
*She narrows her eyes right back at you. And folds her arms to boot.*
I&apos;m glad to see you again, Godwoken, but I can&apos;t talk right now. If we don&apos;t figure out how to get this ship moving, we&apos;re dead.
The Demon&apos;s Advocate
*Something within you strains. You are replete; you cannot absorb more Source.*
Wheat
*Look at him blankly; what on earth is he talking about?*
*Damaged beyond repair, she just wants to be gone.*
Black Ring - Tough
*Cold pain shoots through your veins, sharp and quick, but cleansing. You can feel your body opening up - filling with the promise of power as your ability to channel Source swells.*
Dark Violet
*The spirit&apos;s eyes are full of contempt for you. He spits in your face - a glob of ectoplasmic vapour dissolves into nothing in mid-air.*
*Back away from the creature...*
Deathspike
[IFAN] *Bite his hand. None too gently.*
There will be no further feathers. Those you have stolen are the last. The armour you can bless with them will be the last of Duna&apos;s glory.
I have books, though I hate to part with them.

Ah yes. Discretion is the soul of valour, as they say. I may have a job for a lizard of great valour and discretion. Interested?
*Almira pouts in disappointment, but it quickly morphs into a devilish grin.*
*Consume the Captain&apos;s Source.*
I&apos;m taking the goods, alright. But I&apos;m not just letting this go.
Canvas
Make haste then. The Void&apos;s power is growing - it must be stopped.
It smells like blood... and death...
*Tell her she got what she deserved, and leave her to her fate.*
I wouldn&apos;t be so quick to differentiate. Let me tell you a little something about the Seven: They need Source, and they&apos;re running out of it.
Very well. My lord, there have been so many... obstacles. The House of Shadows, agents of the God King, and other trifles beneath your royal ears to suffer.
But mistress, these clasps and straps, they&apos;re so difficult for my delicate, sensitive, playful fingers. Would you...
*The child&apos;s face screws up in concentration.*
Dwarven Axe
Are you the new servant, then? My my. You look like my old handbag, but dipped in cherry wine. You&apos;ve brought my tea, have you?
You overestimate the queen&apos;s foresight. We&apos;re the honour guard for a wedding. Good thing we were here, too; the Void sent some uninvited guests.
We met the spirit of Brother Kalvin, who had been guarding a possessed dwarf in the vaults. He told us that the only way to remove the demon is to torture the dwarf.
*You feel the statue smile. You feel it embrace you. You fall into the most comfortable darkness...*
This might be an interesting boat ride after all.
*Take your leave.*
Play teaches cubs how to be wolves. &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; toy will help against Alexandar. And so - I hope - will &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. A good weapon&apos;s one thing, but there&apos;s nothing on Rivellon like a good companion.
*You know enough. Let&apos;s move on to other matters.*
You are Source-Muted.
[VILLAIN] *Kneel. Hug both children. Tell them this is a valuable experience that&apos;ll toughen them up.*
Perhaps some other time. It&apos;s such a soothing hobby.
