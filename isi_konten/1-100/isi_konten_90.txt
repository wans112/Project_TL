Today is a momentous one. So momentous, in fact, that I have decided to start keeping a diary, to record my time on the Lady Vengeance, so that one day should I have a family my children and their children may know of my small involvement in these momentous times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to begin. Today the divine lady Dallis, Hammer of the Order, arrived on board. She swept by in all her momentous gloriousness, and I fancy that as she glanced at me a tiny smile twitched at the corner of her mouth. The Hammer smiled at me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possibly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she went to her state room and there she spoke to the doors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did not hear the whole of the conversation, but I believe she spoke of the principle of fortitude, which is, of course, an important part of both the ethos of the Order and of maritime construction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The door seemed suitably inspired and opened for her. She glided... (glud...?) inside, and we have not seen her since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A momentous day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orders! We have orders. The ship is to see action - an evil band of rebels has landed on the island and we are to destroy their ship and perhaps them too! Tomorrow I shall recount the story of our glorious victory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&apos;Fortitude&apos; is the key. &apos;Fortitude&apos; shall open the doors.
I cannot say whether the future brings peace or pain. But I will always be an ally to those that carry Source, to those whose blood is of the heroes of old. And so, as always...
*The spirit is taken by surprise. All its resistance was focused on the tree. But you are stronger, and suddenly its Source is yours.*
High Quality Water Essence
*Level with her. He&apos;s dead.*
*Brush aside the arena master&apos;s remarks. You will not fight anyone else today.*
*Angrily snarl that you ought to force feed some of these fish to him for manipulating you.*
*The little boy lobs a stone across the river. It makes a long arc before plunging into the water below.*
&lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;time, mate. This time.
*He gulps down the potion and stretches his leg in front of him, grinning.*
Eye
You are like me. Proud. Headstrong. But believe me: There is a great deal more you must learn yet.
Forktongue
It hurts, my lord. It hurts...
*Grunt that you ate three men&apos;s hearts for breakfast that morning. They were still beating.*
The &lt;i&gt;&apos;Divine&apos; &lt;/i&gt;killed far more than Godwoken. He wasn&apos;t worthy of the name.
Rightly so! Reds had Sourcerers locked up tight in that caravan... and y&apos;&lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;where they were sending them. Y&apos;look like you&apos;ve been there yourself.
*As she speaks, the Meistr uncorks a vial of shimmering liquid: Source! She lets a couple of drops fall on her hand, but instead of infusing with her body, they quickly evaporate on her scales.*
A fine physician indeed! That&apos;s my boy. Some say all a growin&apos; child needs is food &apos;n&apos; sunshine. I say abstinence and chastity&apos;ll grow him finer than either one of those.
*Change your mind. You&apos;ll steal the secrets from his sallow spirit. Send the Sallow Man to his maker.*
We can&apos;t move forward while those Shriekers are there. You have to find a way to purge them. &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;.
Combine items
Once, I could stand with you. My God&apos;s chosen champion - Godwoken.
Thanks to that strange voice, we might be the only survivors.
|Lowers the damage you receive from explosive attacks|
Captives, to be exact. Enslaved by the witch... uh... you&apos;re not here to visit Alice Alisceon, are you?
Report back to the Shadow Prince.
That was quite presumptuous.
What?!
*You see the outline of a skull - perhaps once an elf, though the flesh has all but rotted from his bones. What remains is the flat, dull colour of sick. Behind him march ornately-clad Black Ring.*
*Watch as she slowly wraps a cut on her arm. Ask why they strung her up.*
Human Mite Die
Excellent! Please, come along.
What have we become?
I don&apos;t.
Rory
*Shout Bahara&apos;s name. Order her to wake you up!*
*Say that you already know how to get past the Path of Blood.*
Come, and look at the fruit of our union. A dragon as yet unhatched. And there are more eggs lying upon velvet cushions in my tent. Dragons-to-be, yet all too vulnerable as they lie dormant in their shells.
*Ask him to think on your time together. He &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; he can trust you to be the one who ascends.*
*Tell him to wait; there&apos;s still something you&apos;d like to discuss.*
Portal of Reality
Talisman
Sourcerer... you&apos;ve made it far. Too far.
*The Seeker ignores you, and continues on with her babbling prayer.*
My gratitude is worth a great deal, if only you&apos;d realise it. But of course you don&apos;t, so we&apos;ll leave it at that.
What a fine morsel you are... go about your business and leave me to me work.
*Ask about Fort Joy. You&apos;re still getting your bearings.*
There you are. I&apos;ve been looking for you. I suppose you can sense how close you are to the demon. Lucky for all of us, I&apos;ve been busy. I know exactly what we need to do to get him out of your head and into the palm of your hand.
Hold - Party Selection
Can you hear me? Whoever you are? Why are you doing this? I - &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; - used to be a great musician. What harm will it do?
[DWARF] *Squint. Beast? The outcast leader of the last rebellion against Queen Justinia?*
He&apos;ll come get me again when he washes off the stench, I know it. But I bit the master Kemm, sure as worms in a sour apple.
My parents... they did nothing to deserve this. They were good. Honest. More honest than me...
The only thing you&apos;ve bought is a ticket to a prison cell!
Ivory
I have no mercy for a Sourcerer. Prepare yourself!
*Implore her explain who she means - who attacked her?*
[UNDEAD] *Lie that yes, of course, you know the &apos;feeling&apos; very well.*
The Void Weapon
*You need to know: who is she?*
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there, frog-legs. Kari&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt she&apos;ll be caring much who or what she slices.
Deus In Machina
*Demand she return the money you gave her. You didn&apos;t mean for her to use it like &lt;i&gt;this.*&lt;/i&gt;
Gave &apos;em a good whippin&apos;, we did. Nasty bugs.
*Stop in your tracks. What if that... &lt;i&gt;whatever-it-is&lt;/i&gt;... is contagious?*
*Neither fire nor force will compel you. You remain defiant. You refuse.*
A rather messy order, for tyrants both command armies and power. Not quite what I offered, either.
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present to you the Marked Assassin: Sebille.
Storage Chest
Three times makes the charm.
Oh, forget it.
She was *sniff* my mate for the last... seven, carry the two, plus fifty... five years. The Magisters - they took her! *Whimpers.*
*The spirit of a dwarven attendee attempts to discreetly sip from a goblet of spectral wine he&apos;s stashed beneath him.*
And you... you&apos;re totally unfit to become the next Divine. You left all of us to drown on the ship that brought us to Fort Joy - it seems like forever ago now, but I still remember it like it was yesterday.
To the city of Arx you must go. I will travel with you, if I may.
Well done! I admire your skills of deduction!
You must report this to Sir Reimond at once. I&apos;ll remain and keep a quiet eye on the hatch, should anyone try to remove them.
*Urge him to accept! Dragons are his destiny. Let him proudly show it!*
*Mention the severed hand you found on the owl&apos;s corpse.*
You tried to save my people?
What... what in the world are &lt;i&gt;you?&lt;/i&gt;
Strikers
*Try to take your finger back.*
I won&apos;t move until the way is clear. The Seekers stand ready.
*The Goddess fights back, struggling to regain control, but your grip is strong. You hear a voice hissing in your head - &apos;No! Stop! Let me speak!&apos;*
*Hold up your palm. She needn&apos;t say another word; you&apos;re on the case.*
It&apos;s vital that you report anything unusual. We must know! Is that clear?
Heals
I am oh so sorry, but these new prices are non-negotiable. Cost of business in the area, you know. Inflation. Interest rates. &lt;i&gt;Voidwoken attacks&lt;/i&gt;...
Poor fella. Still, better freedom than a life beholden to a demon.
In combat, hit [IE_ToggleTacticalCamera] to enter Tactical View.
*Laugh. What&apos;s the matter? Did his breath smell?*
Listen, I can help you if you just -
*You&apos;re having second thoughts. You want to get out of here.*
&lt;i&gt;I KIIIIIIIILL YOU, LEG-MEAT!&lt;/i&gt;
Did you? Tell me, how was it? My friend Tatcher here reckons she&apos;d like to do the same, despite the fact that it could see her posted to Fort Joy. I think she&apos;s crazy. What say you?
A Magister. Dead on the beach. What a surprise.
Of course you are. That is what Godwoken do. The answer to your next question by the by, is yes, I will teach you - if you do something for me first.
Hmm. A disheartening development. It is a shame if you do not honour our... friendly agreement.
You can recline against me with a good book, cherished in the shade I&apos;ll throw.
Magical Big Elven Club
*Blood sprays from the victim&apos;s flesh like lava from a volcano. You turn away.*
Stand on the squares! Make the shiny colours!
Suit yourself. So, please tell me we get to say goodbye now?
*Tell him that&apos;s a beautiful story.*
*She stands over you smiling and wipes her mouth.*
So make no mistake, dear one: the road to divinity may well be paved with dead gods, their blood staining your ivory hands.
...all that you have lost will be yours... and more. So... much... more.
On the one hand, there&apos;s a lot to be said for picking disembodied limbs off the ground and stowing them in your rucksack. On the other hand... oh, there isn&apos;t one.
Careful defendin&apos; cavies, mate. They&apos;d sooner see you swallowed by a Voidwoken than lend you a penny.
You remember what I said. No sense in going at this whole mean world alone.
I&apos;ve got no use for empty platitudes - not from some undergrown barbarian chosen as the Seven&apos;s special pet.
*She leans toward you with an unnerving creak, her eagerness plain.*
Share With Party
Maybe I do.
*Her hum returns - soft at first, then blossoming into a full-fledged hymn.*
All I know is that ever since the first lizards awoke, cold upon rock and sand, some of them dreamt, and in dreams remembered what they were - and could be again.
[MYSTIC] *You sense strange magic around these vines. Lean closer.*
Papaya
Folks here just wanna cry over spilt milk and wait for Gareth. Soon as &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; healed? I&apos;ll find him myself. &lt;i&gt;Someone&lt;/i&gt; has to.
*Point out that the cave is overrun with Voidwoken and - well, he&apos;s dead...*
*The image only lasts a moment, and then you&apos;re back, the empty Soul Jar in your hand while its power pounds through your body.*
*Say she seems particularly pleased.*
*Say that you have no lessons to take from the Magisters.*
*Grin. Tell her to lead the way.*
*Wonder aloud what the local Magisters would think about that.*
Affinity: +1
Speak.
Bow
*Reach out and lift his chin to look into his face.*
There were at least a half-dozen Magisters out there, Aldus. They can&apos;t all have...
*Raedalus startles, as if waking from a nightmare. He gives you a look of hate, and you know that he will flee. His weakness was not absolute, it seems. Raedalus leaves for the Hall of Echoes, to be alone forever.*
Tortured Man
Because it&apos;s his fault! If not for him, I&apos;d still be sitting there, wine in hand, happy as Larry.
