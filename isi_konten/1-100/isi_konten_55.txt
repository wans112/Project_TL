Here I am, Lohse. Meet your first worshipper.

That, we can do.
But I watch the gate! I am the key! &lt;i&gt;I am the key - !&lt;/i&gt;

You! Report. Have you uncovered any hidden stores?
We told Amyro that we agreed with Saheila to save him on certain conditions - that he tell us how to escape Fort Joy as soon as he&apos;s free.
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;VELVET WHIP&lt;/b&gt;.*

The Sourcerer Vasnya told us that a Sourcerer was tortured by Magisters and spoke of &apos;Seekers&apos; and &apos;Godwoken&apos;.
No. I doubt your heart. I will not help you.

*He taps his fingers and mouths silently while he counts, until he arrives at an acceptable figure.*

You must wear the amulet as you consume Source - the excess power will be siphoned into it, until it is full.
There isn&apos;t anywhere safer. That&apos;s what I mean.
But don&apos;t let that dismay you, for these sins will be washed clean by the knowledge you committed them to save all of existence. To save your kin, and your loved ones, and your empire.
Don&apos;t you get saucy with me when you clearly don&apos;t know the first thing about sauce!
The fiend&apos;s greed gave him away - he was peddling items that belonged to those missing from our ranks. He saw my men before they could seize him, and fled.
But my master&apos;s generosity is second only to his power. And he bid that you be rewarded. Thus...
Did I disappoint you? Oh, but don&apos;t worry: I may just have to push the next fella a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; further.
You don&apos;t get it, do you? In here, &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;call the shots. You so much as tickle me and you&apos;ll be tossed to my Source Hounds as a new chew toy. Do as I say, or you won&apos;t be doing much of anything at all.
[SEBILLE] *Tell the brute he&apos;s fallen low if he&apos;s shaking people down for pennies.*
*You&apos;re curious - what was she doing here in the first place?*
*Fane backs away, scratching his head. It seems that didn&apos;t go as he&apos;d expected. He is lost in thought, though. She must have said something he found interesting...*
I don&apos;t want your dirty money. I just want to see you dead.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The Wolf. Take him. The Wolf. Take... take... the Wolf...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Come find me. Come be with me.&lt;/i&gt;
Daeyena... You! You will die for this.
Now, an &apos;important person&apos; does not come to Driftwood unless they seek someone even more important than themselves, so I further surmise you are here for me and will help me down. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
*The goddess&apos;s tears still stream freely, but an aura of loving calm now permeates the soft, moist air.*
Absorb the Source from the fountain.
Ifan rejected Dorian Gall&apos;s contract on Micheil Ros. He claims a higher purpose - ridding the world of a Divine.

We left the unhatched egg with Sadha.
But I ain&apos;t a violent man, Jack! Just pisses me off to see dwarves sing the praises of the Reds! Bloody disgrace, I say.
The powerful ones do. Nothing they enjoy more than a private playground where no prying eyes can interfere with their...&lt;i&gt; fun.&lt;/i&gt;
You &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;their names, Malady. Can&apos;t you even pay them that much respect...?
*You feel newfound powers of the Source course wildly through your body. Deep inside your soul, a voice calls for you.*
*Ifan grins, flashing pointed white teeth.*
*Grin and say you found the fugitive, then delivered him to the Magisters.*
Don&apos;t bother thanking me just yet, though. I dare say you&apos;ll be begging to die before long. I&apos;ll start with lesser toxins, just to see how you react - and take it from there.
Dearest Valla,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&apos;t wait for me. The Magisters will have found me by the time you read this, and you know full well what they are doing to Sourcerers. These words may be the last I post to you. I will always love you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pats
The more your skull clacks, the less sense you make, Rask. Use your sight - he&apos;s &lt;i&gt;drenched &lt;/i&gt;in Source.
Then go, Beast of the Sea. I will miss my beloved cousin. But I won&apos;t mourn him. Perhaps - perhaps I will be lucky enough to meet him again, should the Beast will it.
You&apos;re lucky to have found an ally here. You won&apos;t find many in this house, and certainly not among the queen&apos;s regiment. That Isbeil hasn&apos;t found me out is a minor miracle.
*She turns and shouts to unseen comrades. Her voice is a guttural snarl, ruined by the effects of Deathfog.*

While enslaved by the Magisters, I noticed a tablet in their excavation site in the Blackpits. It bore markings that looked very similar to how these Swornbreakers were described to me...
*Suggest he tell you what he&apos;s guarding, now that he&apos;s death... er, dead.*
Yeah? Can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised. She&apos;s been gearin&apos; up to take on that Voidwoken down there. That fight&apos;ll be a doozy. The thing&apos;s been watchin&apos;, learnin&apos;.

*Say it&apos;s going to take a lot more than a joke and a song. Is she sure she&apos;s ready?*
*Tell them to cut it out. You&apos;ve had enough ego-stroking.*
Besides, I wasn&apos;t fishing for an apology. I was merely making a point. About oneself. &lt;i&gt;Alone.&lt;/i&gt;
I... I... oh Seven&apos;s sympathy, I saw those &lt;i&gt;things &lt;/i&gt;dragging the Sourcerers along the cliffs... towards the wreckers&apos; caves. I... I... &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;, no more! It&apos;s gone!
Are you a fool? Must be, to pull a move as thick as that one. C&apos;mon, then. Off to prison with you.

*Raise your eyebrows and note that Voidwoken only appear where Source is used.*
Instead, Dallis and that mage of hers brought us here. They wanted to use our powers to hunt out some ancient relics.
*Point out that this wasn&apos;t his fault - his friend seems to have died doing his duty. He should honour his memory.*
*Smile quietly. Doesn&apos;t he know Dallis has a plan? He &lt;i&gt;needs &lt;/i&gt;you.*
*Offer her the opportunity to set the Meistr free herself.*
*He turns to you, so fast you don&apos;t see the movement. His eyes look blank - as if the Void has touched them. He tries to speak, but lacks the strength to do more than croak two words:*
*He pulls his hand back, languidly, and licks the blood that drips from the puncture marks you bit into his flesh.*
Lohar, eh? Where will I find this boss o&apos; yours?
The bargain. Yes. It was so simple, really. He asked only that I occasionally chant of the Black Ring&apos;s evils, of the perils of the Void. I never asked what price I might pay if I faltered. I only reveled in the laurels the public crowned me with.
*Say you don&apos;t care for expensive things.*

Hah! Collared like a dog! A very tall, very... uh... strange-smelling dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has a soft spot for beauty and you carry that choker off so very well.

*Ask if he has anything that might interest you.*
Then you&apos;re as useless to me as a Voidwoken, and barely less ugly. I&apos;ll have to fight my own battle.

*Ask him to remind you of your mission.*
*Turn away from the grim spectacle.*
*Ask what Kemm and the paladins are doing at the Cathedral.*
They forced our hand. We&apos;ve got to do whatever&apos;s necessary to hold the rot at bay.
*Take your leave.*
That is not to say of course, I could ever forget about you and the intimacy we shared. &apos;When all is at its darkest, the soul longs for the light of love&apos;, remember?
That was... that was you?
They called me those names too. And they&apos;ve dangled another in front of me and you: &lt;i&gt;Divine. &lt;/i&gt;You want it bad, don&apos;t you? You&apos;re chasing this thing - this label. Maybe you&apos;re trying to save the world. Heh. Maybe you&apos;re just doing it because they tell you to.
The craftmistress is bound to the helmet. She spent countless hours here, honing her art to mastery&apos;s edge.
Instant death for the living.

[These scribbled meeting notes were clearly taken in a hurry, and barely any segments are legible save the following passage:]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For too long, the White Magisters have awaited results for our toil. Yet, the recent expedition to the Council of Seven laid the foundations of our Grand Design. Needless to say, we follow still in the footsteps of the Divine...
