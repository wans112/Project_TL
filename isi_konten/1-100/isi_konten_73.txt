My queen... gone. If there&apos;s any solace in her death, it&apos;s that I might again see her in the Hall of Echoes.
There is no death for the loyal!
*Give her a congratulatory hug.*
You, Ifan ben-Mezd, the Silver Claw,
Highlight Characters
Human Mask of the Shapeshifter
*The bird musters just enough strength to throw you a look of disgust.*
Agitator
A guard at the Ros estate told us that the cake was a gift from the Doctor.
[FANE] *Tell her you&apos;re a stranger in these lands, and you very much wish you could go home.*
*The Queen smiles her approval and looks to her advisor.*
I never would have stopped those disappearances... I&apos;m just another bloody useless elf. The Magisters were right to get rid of my kind...
I am yours. Always.
*Express your sympathies. Gwydian is dead.*
*...and knowledge floods your mind, the result of years of study that you never did. But then the Sallow Man&apos;s grin becomes a snarl, and his outreached hand grasps at you, grabs hold of a part of you, and &lt;i&gt;pulls...*&lt;/i&gt;
Voice Of Dread
You know me now, don&apos;t you, child? I saved you when the ship went down... I blessed you, made you powerful... And now I&apos;ve come to seek some power in return...
I... I knew the Voidwoken would come if I used my Source. But I thought I could keep us safe. I was... wrong...
Put me down! I hope someone puts YOU down!
My! Unless I&apos;ve gone quite colour blind you must be the Red Prince. The lizard consulate is gone I&apos;m afraid- all that survives of it is what I managed to take with me. Care to see what I have? Perhaps we can make an arrangement...
*Ponder what the Hall of Echoes was like.*
Fan of Knives Skillbook
*Argue that even though Sadha will bear your children, that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the prophecy will come true.*
*Stingtail digs into his pocket, and with the sulking look of a child surrendering its hard-earned candy, he hands you a couple of oranges.*
Stand back, say nothing, and above all, be grateful.
Yes - yes. This news does muddle things a tad...
I see you.
Twined with creeping tendrils, this livewood shield is of Elven origin.
His what now?
*She takes the invitation from you and reads it closely, then looks up at you for the first time. A spark of recognition lights up her eyes but is gone in a flash.*
PAPA!
*Tell her Mordus is no longer a problem. They can finish the search.*
*State the password. &lt;i&gt;Fortitude.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Back down. You didn&apos;t come looking for trouble.*
Reckon you&apos;re luckier than I may be...
*The bull lazily chews non-existent cud.*
Birds Clear Forest 01
We can use Mordus&apos; amulet to prove that he is dead.
Well, that&apos;s no surprise. Your kind have all three Houses riled up in a frenzy. The House of Dreams are communing with dead warriors, the House of Law are drawing up new maps for after the war.
Oh, what an adorable little liar you are! But I have to admit... I almost admire your pathetic attempt to play hero.
Surrey Family Tomb
[BARBARIAN] *Pick up her next full glass. Smash it on the floor. That&apos;s enough.*
No, they seized it. They rebelled against the King and declared themselves &apos;Gods&apos;.
Did he regret his deal with the demon?
(You want me to be quiet? &lt;i&gt;Then stop shushing me.&lt;/i&gt;)
Apparently I&apos;ll be able to find him near Driftwood, where we&apos;re heading. &lt;i&gt;Exciting&lt;/i&gt;.
Sick as a leper&apos;s cat! From the state of it, I&apos;d say she&apos;s bein&apos; cared for by a bunch of beardless babes who never loved anyone but their own mums.
Numpad Minus
You lie. You gave me your word we&apos;d find the Master first. You broke your word. Now I break with you.
I, for one, will not shed tears for a half-demon mongrel.
[BARBARIAN] *Grin and ask if a well-trained soul breaks bone as well as a well-hefted axe.*
The Black Ring appreciates yore service, Lone Wolf. Yow can start by killin&apos; those Divine Order pigs down there. &lt;i&gt;Now, scum!&lt;/i&gt;
Memorial of Heroes
Well, then I shan&apos;t take up more of your time.
*You&apos;re flung from the vision, screaming ringing in your ears. Back in your own body, you double over, trying not to retch.*
Ss... Srs.. He-...
Thief! Thief! Somebody, get &apos;em!
*Gareth offers his farewell and hums to himself. You don&apos;t recognise the tune, but you imagine it to be a hymn praising Lucian.*
Heehee! That&apos;s right!
The barracks was meant to be surrounded. How did they slip by?
Lightning Strike
*Tell him you&apos;ve come here to kill him.*
Buy
*The male dwarf expells two lungfuls of air, and glances happily at his companion.*
Magical Dwarven Polearm
*Ask how they learned about these Source weapons, the ones that can help them against the Shriekers.*
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you, Sebille. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
*Ask her where this vault is, exactly.*
*That could be anyone. Ask who he means.*
She, like you, is the reason the House of Shadows stirs. Their assassins had me cornered. And so I took the last, desperate action left open to me: I fled bodily into the dream realm. This is my world now. To Rivellon I can never return.
You have rendered us a valuable service. The least I can do is grant you a reward. I trust you won&apos;t confound my expectations by spending it well.
You are in the presence of &lt;i&gt;royalty. &lt;/i&gt;Her Highness is due proper respect from subject and admirer alike.
He must be tougher than he looks, to have survived that fight with you and the others. The wicked ones are always the last to shuffle off to the Hall of Echoes though, ain&apos;t they?
I know... ill news flies fast.
*Tell him the Voidwoken have spoken to you.*
*He glares at you before stomping off, resuming his patrol.*
*Ask what happened to him before.*
I suppose we should come to the aid of those who failed to aid themselves...
Four great heroes lie buried in the Stonegarden. Their graves may be worth investigating.
*Jahan? Say it&apos;s you, Lohse! What happened to him?*
Most people are too sentimental to admit that friendship is a transaction. I am not. I&apos;m sure we can &lt;i&gt;both &lt;/i&gt;be of use to each other...
The Mad Witch uses this in her games...
She clearly drew the Magisters&apos; attentions. Our fates were written.
This humble pair is capable of bringing tyrants and lovers alike to their trembling knees.
Some truths are better kept under one&apos;s hat. I can&apos;t tell you who stole your supplies.
Black-Haired Girl
&lt;br&gt;K I L L .
The Elven Scion asked us to kill the Shadow Prince and bring his heart to the Mother Tree. Is this wise?
You... you&apos;re right. Here, take the key. We&apos;ll... we&apos;ll leave you to it. I don&apos;t want to see Donna like that again.
We opened the door without returning the original painting to Kemm&apos;s vault.
Without Arhu, no-one can bypass the Path of Blood. Even in an emergency.
*Take one last look at your lizard lover, then turn and walk away.*
You another friend of Kniles&apos;? I told that Magister freak to git back to his little dungeon in the keep, and I&apos;ll tell you the same.
Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
Lower the bridge for Mari.
We cannot fail, Lohse.
Hel... help me...
You okay, chief?
*Give the Source back to all the peoples. Release Divinity into the world. When everyone is Divine, &lt;i&gt;no-one&lt;/i&gt; is Divine.*
*Tell Forktongue that the Sallow Man has a task for him. The commander at the camp whom he&apos;ll know as &apos;Wordless&apos; is a traitor. The God King commands her death.*
Build your wings with these blessed feathers. Enact our rites.
*Sarias&apos; memories flood you: A warrior, proud and true, you fight the Lone Wolves at the sawmill for Saheila, your scion, and for the future of all the elves... or all that still remain. But the fight goes ill.*
Spirit of the Apprentice
Let me tell you something: I took this weapon from a Black Ring scout I killed with my own bare hands. Fear? Sure. You have my respect, but I won&apos;t walk in fear. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;ll be on my way.
[BEAST] *Say you&apos;re known as the &apos;Beast of the Seas&apos;. &apos;Beast&apos; will do.*
You must be starved for company to linger around here, friend.
Plant your own herb garden! Take any herb and combine it with a bucket to create a seedling. Then, just place your seedling in the ground and watch it grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
We landed on Reaper&apos;s Coast. Time to turn in the contract.
I have no idea what any of this means...
Finally kicked the bucket, this&apos;n. Didn&apos;t think I&apos;d miss his grumblin&apos; and boastin&apos;, but... a spirit like that leaves a big hole when it&apos;s snuffed out. Rest his soul.
You do not just walk away from this.
SHUT UP! Stop! Just- please, stop! Please...
*She gives you a sideways glance. Then turns her gaze back to the fire.*
That was the last straw. The time has come to play. Out comes the needle; in goes the needle!
Karma
&lt;i&gt;OhmightyDuna, saveyourchildren, deliverus fromtheVoid, OhMightyDunasaveyourchildren, deliverusfromtheVoid, OhmightyDuna...&lt;/i&gt;
You cannot do this in your current form!
Heh. Some of that power goin&apos; to your head, is it? I&apos;ll be honest: I&apos;ve thought about it. And I like to think I&apos;d be a good... king? Weird to feel that word on my lips like that.
I ain&apos;t got time for you, y&apos;hear? I gotta, er... save my energy.
Bah! You are the fetid dirt on my boot. You are nothing at all. &lt;b&gt;I am the Source King! I SHALL RULE!&lt;/b&gt;
*Push the issue. Is he short-sighted as all that?*
*Ask what kind of visions.*
Dragons will spread my dominion over untold worlds. And my throne: it will be &lt;i&gt;eternal&lt;/i&gt; with Sadha by my side.
I&apos;m keeping a close eye on things, but I doubt she expects much. The so-called &apos;Hammer&apos; is just as blunted as her namesake, when it comes to such matters. I doubt very much she has the faintest clue to whom we truly bend the knee...
*Apologise again, but you would like to ask her something else.*
A hunger gnaws at elves, a driving lust...
*ROAR!*
Those Godwoken who resist are to be killed and purged, that they may never be resurrected.
She is full of surprises. My wood was splintered, but my spirit intact. It was a great feat, but given her skill, not a surprising one.
Careful, it might still be here! I think I made it angry -
*Affirm that you did.*
*Ifan nods, but his mind is elsewhere already. He looks different, somehow, a vestige of command has returned to this ex-soldier.*
We convinced Murga, champion of Driftwood, to fight.
My thanks, with balance restored I have the power to keep my &lt;i&gt;passenger &lt;/i&gt;under control.
The Gods choose &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;as their champion. Some pet elf with a spoiled face.
[RED PRINCE] *Say you&apos;re a prince, then smile warmly and ask if perhaps she is a princess.*
Target character receives a damage bonus equal to the percentage of their missing Vitality. For example, a character with 30% Vitality will gain a 70% damage bonus.
You can get going now. I have to come up with a believable explanation for why the Meistr went missing on my watch.
[RED PRINCE] *Assume a persona. Say your name is Magister... Prince.*
(I know how to spell &apos;introduce.&apos; It&apos;s i-n-t-r-o-d-u-c-e.)
You&apos;re right. I should.
*You pull your hand away from the jar, your head swimming. You can feel the dwarf&apos;s cold terror still twisting in your gut.*
The Master is on the Nameless Isle.
B... bock? Transformed. Not a chicky baby anymore? ALL gone? ALL gone for good?
