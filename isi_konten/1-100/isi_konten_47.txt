*The Red Prince nods and gives you a smile that wavers ever so delicately between courtesy and contempt.*
I can&apos;t believe I ever liked you. I can&apos;t believe I ever trusted you.
We should leave. This place unsettles me.
Better dead than enslaved.
*Ask if he can hear you.*
Trying to bribe an authority? That&apos;s an arrestable offence!
I can do that. Repetition is good for memory, you know...
*Claim that the groom is in grave danger. But there&apos;s still time for you to help him!*
Was hoping to find a Magister or two hiding down here. Would&apos;ve gutted them like fishes.
*However, having and giving seem to be two very different things. He proposes a trade. When Fane asks what he wants in return, the Magister grins widely.*
*Ask Fane what the Eternal civilisation was like.*

He &lt;i&gt;laughed&lt;/i&gt;. Laughed while we screamed.
As we grow strong, the Voidwoken attacks worsen. Maybe it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; our fault. Maybe the Order is right.
*As interesting as this is, you have places to be. Excuse yourself and leave.*
I accept, and forget what I see. I go my way, you go yours.
*Lohse wraps Malady in a huge hug; Malady grimaces and pats her back stiffly.*
*Enquire about his injuries.*
Hnuh?!
When our brothers drove out the supporters of the Black Ring, you refused orders and took up arms against Divinity.
*&apos;I see you, Godwoken,&apos; it croaks. &apos;I &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; you.&apos;*
*You had a taste for wine and ale, as well as a variety of other... sensual pleasures. Life is a coffer replete with countless delights.*
Now that&apos;s a verse I can drink to!
Some... some form of demon seized her, and nested inside her mind. She cannot speak or move. We did what we could to help, but we could not risk provoking the beast within...

*Press him for details - you&apos;ve met your God, but what about the others?*
Those Paladins treat the rest of us like servants - it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;them &lt;/i&gt;who&apos;re supposed to serve &lt;i&gt;us!&lt;/i&gt;
The intrigues of the Empire follow me into exile. The shadows close around me.
*The dwarf looks up in shock as you enter the room. He looks around at the bodies near him in panic.*
Only Lohse knows the truth.
*Offer them another body part.*
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry, but she&apos;ll have to deal with the issue on her own.*
*Her face is straight, but her eyes dance with mirth.*
And yet you renounced me.
Marked For Death
Get lost, funny wo&apos;an. And don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
Go no further. We are at ritual. Do not disturb us.
Magisters and Paladins lie dead on the beach. Why were they here? Who killed them?
Elves, too.
What are you conspiring about over there? You! What&apos;s your name?
Well, well. It seems that &apos;everybody desires a piece of me&apos;, as you mortals say. How irritating...
*Examine the swirling ethereal image.*
Get it?
Village Busy 01
Control the forces of nature, increasing the movement speed of you and your allies by 1.5m (as long as your allies stay within 10m of you).
Yeh&apos;ll have more luck gettin&apos; Dallis to unlock them. The poor girl&apos;s not in her best mind without Gareth.
May Tir-Cendelius ever watch over you.
Ain&apos;t no-one deserves that end! No-one should see their brothers coming at them with murder in their eyes...
You... &lt;i&gt;ate&lt;/i&gt; his head. You ate...
A Heavy Wooden Door
*She smiles. She knows you believe her. Or at least that you &lt;i&gt;should.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The deity&apos;s head and hands are missing, severed as if by a sword. You can&apos;t tell if this was meant to be symbolic somehow, or a mere act of vandalism.*
*Hesitate. Probably not.*
*You lean across and scratch the dead head&apos;s nose.*
Done thinking?
*He turns to you. He looks &lt;i&gt;insane.&lt;/i&gt; He takes a deep breath and exhales... a cloud of greenish gas envelops you... and suddenly you &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;him.*
Elven Thorndancer
*Wonder how she saved herself from Braccus&apos; hex.*
Have&lt;i&gt; you &lt;/i&gt;come to kill me as well? Take a number - you&apos;re all lining up quickly.
*A whistle-like device sits nestled in your hand.*
Battle Source Puppet
*Ask why you need to wait until you leave this place. Like she said, time is short. And who knows if you&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;ever &lt;/i&gt;leave?*
Lohar became mayor, and Brayton Barnes grew rich,
Review. Halted. Anger. Detected.
Clay-Filled Bucket
*Say that even though you didn&apos;t ascend to divinity at the Council of Seven, you still appreciate his support there.*
*He winces, the pain evident.*
Sure wish you&apos;d gone back to save the others.
Truly? Is it some sort of breeding technique or - ah. One of your human phrases...
*Flash a modest smirk. Winning battles is your thing. It&apos;s what you do.*
Of course, in a much more mundane, practical sense you will be dead, but I gather you creatures are very susceptible to simple platitudes.
Magical Metal Armour
She is your friend. Not mine. You want to know her business? Ask her.
Wishin&apos; you the best of luck.
Mastering the Source
*Tell him that&apos;s not gonna happen, then walk away.*
They won&apos;t succeed though - I know what needs to be done, and I have good, &lt;i&gt;loyal &lt;/i&gt;Magister and Paladin companions to help me see that it is done.
*Tell her there&apos;s no dignity in having harmed one of your own.*
Never mind. Just mind yourself.
Stumbled at the final hurdle. How unfortunate for you.
Fine! Fine. Take the drudanae. I&apos;ll find more. Another way. Somehow. I have to. For all our sakes.
Wonderful material once chopped though, I&apos;ll give you that. Just look at the Lady Vengeance!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt;
The man that was a god. Whom I remember laughing and drinking wine from the family vineyard. More man than god, I suppose.
*Reach out and give him a bear hug.*
*He leans in and adjusts your collar with a sharp tug, balancing its weight so it no longer presses unpleasantly on your neck. He winks.*
Ah. Right you are, right you are. But I must ask some... &lt;i&gt;uncomfortable&lt;/i&gt; questions. Are you ready to answer?
I can&apos;t help but sympathise with him. He just wanted to go home.
I say... no! The Gods guide our every move. I dare you to outsmart me &lt;i&gt;now!&lt;/i&gt;
[SEBILLE] *Tell him you&apos;ve been the harbinger of justice for many a soul. You&apos;ve earned the right.*
Open the Meistr&apos;s hatch.
No. No! You! You are one of it! You must be chained! &lt;i&gt;You must be chained! YOU MUST BE CHAINED!&lt;/i&gt;
Looks like I found our killer. You&apos;re in for it now!
The Beast of the Sea returned to the dwarven kingdom - not as a rebel, but as a lawmaker. Merciful and wise, he led the dwarves into an age of prosperity. His grave looks out over the sea.
Trina
The dead rose from their graves in the Stonegarden, insisting that the ‘Covenant’ would be fulfilled. They attacked us.
Right you are, red fish! You&apos;re the chief! The chief of o&apos;ening chests, I wager!
Believe it or don&apos;t. The Divine Order doesn&apos;t need our loyalty. They&apos;ll save us in spite of ourselves. Even you, skin-shedder.
*Look at him more closely, trying to remember if you&apos;ve met before.*
My, these smelling salts are strong stuff.
&lt;i&gt;Your Divine welcomes you.&lt;/i&gt;
[BEAST] *Lean in and growl that you don&apos;t care what he asks - you want an answer.*
Character Assignment
Well, SHE won&apos;t be missed.
Fine. But I warn you, don&apos;t push me any further.*
*She casts her eyes over the wreck below the bridge.*
The consulate&apos;s in shambles. Are the Paladins just going to stand around while the city burns?
It won&apos;t come off! Someone will burn for this.
*This guy looks dangerous. Tell Fane you&apos;ll handle it yourself.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell him that given his current circumstances he can probably consider himself relieved of his guard duties.*
Alright, so be it. I took this from a Magister - perhaps it can be of some use to you.
Did he lead the world
So. You found me.
No such thing as just another lizard. No such thing as a lizard that means no harm.
*She gasps... then bows her head to you in respect.*
Why don&apos;t you pick it up for me, lover-kin?
*For a moment, Isbeil appears almost... relaxed. Her eyes flash blue; her face quivers.*
*Gasp* My brothers. My sisters.
Such wanton destruction, sister... these humans ruined our homeland, now they&apos;re intent on ruining their own as well... savages...
You ask a lot of questions. The kind that get you into trouble.
I wonder for how long he roamed the earth... and now he&apos;s gone.
Mother, it&apos;s so &lt;i&gt;obvious.&lt;/i&gt; &apos;Speak &lt;i&gt;the word&lt;/i&gt; and I shall open.&apos;
Shouldn&apos;t you be... &lt;i&gt;remembering&lt;/i&gt; something, somewhere?
Truly we are blessed to know you. If Amadia favours you, that is all I need to know. Go in peace, sister.
*The first candle wavers away gently. The second flashes and pops to blackness.*
Very well done! You protected an ocean of candles over your own life. And now that ocean will only grow larger.
Speak with the cliff-top statue.
*Pocket the cash and walk away.*
You&apos;re alive! Wasn&apos;t sure you would be. Samadel, this is the one I told you about...
*Tell him to go right ahead.*
*Fane&apos;s drive to uncover the universe&apos;s secrets saw the Eternals cast into the Void. His hubris saw his people turned into Voidwoken.*
A humble but handy pair, this needle and thread may require a bit of harrumph before they&apos;re able to aid you against the forces of evil.
No. I would not.
*Ask how it intends to retrieve its soul.*
*Tell her you might&apos;ve said and done things you shouldn&apos;t have.*
Sebille is dead. The needle shall never dance again.
*Say you&apos;ll think about it, and take your leave.*
*Tell him you don&apos;t believe him. There&apos;s no &apos;young one&apos;.*
*The waiter, you say, brings the order to the kitchen, then sits and watches.*
*Once, this sign had something to say. That was then, this is now.*
Give! &lt;i&gt;Now!&lt;/i&gt;

*No, you say, you can&apos;t do it. If he doesn&apos;t like dogs he doesn&apos;t deserve your joke. Take your leave.*
Remember that you serve the people, not the other way around.
Royal Key
Mind you, there are worse places to spend eternity...
I will not say it. It would be blasphemy to even utter the words... the Sallow Man is a trickster, a deviant. They must have been lies that he concocted - &lt;i&gt;they must be!&lt;/i&gt;
Let&apos;s see what else the demon is keeping down here.
*Ifan snarls, upper lip curling back. The man looks up at the sound and does a double-take when he sees Ifan standing there. He bounds over and - ignoring you completely - embraces Ifan warmly.*
Gone. Crept away like mist in the morning.
Cullwoods Mill
*Rue that when you stand up for what you believe, you may end up paying a terrible price. Then consume the spirits&apos; Source, all in one go.*
*The dwarf sighs and rubs his temples.*
The war of the races approaches. The elves shall stand and you shall fall. You can&apos;t run, and you can&apos;t hide. You shall not see the end of us.
This simple and down-to-earth bow looks like nothing special at first glance, but closer attention reveals the delicate hand-crafted grooves and charms etched into its surface. Whoever owned this bow surely loved it dearly.

*The ghost slowly fades to nothing, leaving just a silent scream on the wind, and its power rushing through your veins.*
RRIAOW! Hiss!
*Tell her &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; thinking she should shut up and get naked.*

Malady said I should&apos;ve met one of the Gods when I had my vision in the Hall of Echoes. But I didn&apos;t.
It&apos;s over.
No deal, thief. I&apos;ve have plans for you. Now come with me.
