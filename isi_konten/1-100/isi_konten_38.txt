Adlard, Gale, and Hellwys Jupp all left their posts. Fortimere too, I suspect. Gone to serve a friend, they said, and maybe that&apos;s true. No matter; we&apos;ll fight the Voidwoken with what we have, and we&apos;ll win.
*Stand by and watch the scene unfold.*
[JESTER] *Say &apos;a riddle&apos;.*
Master Lock
*Slowly nod your head. &apos;Yes.&apos;*
Troll Club
Who knows. Maybe there&apos;re some of &apos;em left. Deathfog can&apos;t&apos;ve gotten all of &apos;em.
*She nods quietly, as though she knew this all along.*
*Observe the elf. She seems very, very drunk. You lean in and whisper your darkest secret into her ear.*
I met a lich, imprisoned and drained of his Source. It seems I started something of a trend. He remains strapped to his table.
Gold Reward
Livewood Bridge
What a fool you are. In what world does treasure simply appear from on high?
*Tell her you saw him fall with your own eyes. What happened?*
*She embraces you passionately.*
*The spirit twists and turns in front of you. It looks lost. It looks scared. It looks desperate.*
*She waits a moment, as if listening to her own reflection...&lt;i&gt;*&lt;/i&gt;
Did you regret becoming Divine?
Reminder to self:&lt;br&gt;Living efficiently means living more deeply.&lt;br&gt;- Make one&apos;s bed in the morning.&lt;br&gt;- Take care of business as soon as one can.&lt;br&gt;- Get one&apos;s crafting done early, that one may have more items of use and fewer to carry.
*Demand he tell you more. How many did he kill?*

But Butter&apos;s different. I can&apos;t lie about her - she&apos;s the one good thing I&apos;ve got. I can&apos;t let her go, and I can&apos;t let her rot in that prison. I&apos;ve got to break her free, and I need money to do it.
Take it and go, and if you say a word to Julian or anyone else...
Shush, Fedor. You, lizard. Go to Reimond at the docks. He&apos;ll want to know of the news you bring. And hurry - he sails soon.
Summoning skills let you call temporary allies in battle and buff them.
*He looks you up and down.*
Weapon
The whole world is going to hell in a hand-basket, and I can&apos;t get no taters for supper.
*Knowing that this is humiliating for a kin, tell him to kneel on &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; knees.*
I will find that snivelling little coward. He will bow before me. But first, I will deal with you.
You must leave. The one who must be chained will take your soul. Do not let it speak. Do not let it speak to you.
What a foolish mistake.
I have almost everything I need to... go. I just need &lt;i&gt;that book&lt;/i&gt;.
[UNDEAD] *Kneel down. Lift the little boy&apos;s chin towards you. Tell him death isn&apos;t so bad.*
*The ghost turns to you, her finger urgently pointing towards something unseen. Silent lips move, issuing an urgent, unheard plea.*
Yes, and yes again. The word is spoken. Welcome to the stateroom.
So many souls, blinked out in a heartbeat. I&apos;ve never seen anything so terrible.
*Ask if you can try the axe.*
If there was a cave to explore, do you think I&apos;d tell &lt;i&gt;you?! &lt;/i&gt;Oh, I really don&apos;t feel like chatting now. Why don&apos;t you go home to your wife and kids, maybe follow your grease trail back here another day.
So I find out. On my own, away from the storm that surely comes. The God King is defeated - but the door to the Void is open, left there by the woman I once thought would be Divine.
Cleanliness is next to godliness, my sweet...
Return to Sanders the Toyseller.

Perfect for backstabbing your foes in the kidneys. Or peeling an apple.

You will be cured of something entirely dangerous.
But what if they&apos;re friends?
*Summon every last bit of strength you have, and spit at the figure&apos;s feet.*
I&apos;m going to go and find my cat now - he must be lonely without me. Bye, I won&apos;t forget you!
As we were to be purged, the Doctor appeared - and killed Lucian and Dallis.
Spirit of an Elementalist
Not a deeeeeeal. A prrrrrromise. I&apos;m a deeeeeemon, seeeeeee? What saaaaaaaaaay I ooooooowe you? I paaaaaaaay you, when I see you!
It won&apos;t, okay? You can quote me on that.
I can... I can trust you, can&apos;t I? You wouldn&apos;t do wrong by the dead?
See that, snakeface? If we don&apos;t have order here, we won&apos;t even survive long enough for the Reds to cure us. Surprised you lent a hand. Well done.
We defeated the elven challengers, and completed the test.
Ah, you&apos;re back. Looking to add some weight to your rucksack?

Yeah, sure. And I&apos;m Damian reincarnated. You&apos;re under arrest!
Bladefinger

*Is he kidding? Say it&apos;s not the time for idle chat.*
Water? &lt;i&gt;Wine&lt;/i&gt;, for goodness sake! Ooohhh...
*Ifan looks stricken, jaw clenched tightly as he looks at what remains of the elf. He won&apos;t meet your eye.*
Target range: [3]&lt;br&gt;Target can be moved [2] away from its position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Select item or character first, then select its destination.
Leya, it does me heart a deal o&apos; good to see yeh smile like this. Y&apos;don&apos;t belong out here in the fray, do yeh. Gentle souls don&apos;t.
Advice...? I&apos;m afraid not, this time. I&apos;d tell you to not do anything I wouldn&apos;t do, but in truth that isn&apos;t a wise mantra for most to follow...
[IFAN] *Bow in sympathy. Tell her you lost loved ones to the Deathfog too.*
You&apos;re clearly no Magister. Garments coated in dirt. Haphazard garb. How&apos;d you come to be here?
*Ask the lizard if he knows anything about Griff&apos;s missing supplies.*
*Carver&apos;s face pulls into a sneer.*
Oh, but it&apos;s my very business to know things, Ifan.
*She&apos;s right - you don&apos;t like the way your God has been acting. Denounce Rhalic.*
Prince? I  don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any princes. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
A Hunger from Beyond
*Assume he enjoys his privates where they are, rather than skewered upon your needle.*
The Black Ring&apos;s pullin&apos; her strings. Should&apos;ve figured. But I gotta say - I&apos;d rather her just be straight-up cruel than simply too weak to resist an evil as flippin&apos; obvious as the Black Ring.
I have seen the very soul of you. I have partaken of  your flesh. I have assimilated your being into my own.
*Tell him to dispense with the niceties. If he has something to say, pray say it.*
None would pass the Path of Blood.
*The Magister smiles, but he does not make eye contact with you. He shifts his weight from the left foot to the right.*
Then you best be listenin&apos; closely and answerin&apos; truthfully: where do we stand with Mordus?
&lt;br&gt;Target is out of sight!
Death...
[1] decreases the amount of Action Points it takes to equip different items during combat.
*Tell the elf to relax - you&apos;re not a &lt;i&gt;human &lt;/i&gt;after all. You mean no harm.*
*You are nothing. You are no-one. You do not exist - not really.*
Change Gender to female
*Ask to trade.*
Rawhide Armour
Brew of Memory
This journey of ours, this strange and violent pilgrimage, it has... changed some preconceptions.
*Tell the kid Gil is right. You just came from the lower deck - you&apos;re not going back down now.*
He said that if anyone were to approach his remains, then the world would be left vulnerable to the Void. It was not for me to question how - only to serve.
*The spirit&apos;s hands are clamped firmly over her ears. Her mouth is firmly closed, and her eyes are squeezed shut. As you reach out, you hear a dry, crackling voice...*
A recipe book.
Oooh! Shall they provide me with my mum?!
Gareth suggested we ask Lord Arhu for assistance in locating Dallis.
The tree itself must have gone rotten at the roots. No wonder it drove her Scion away.
[OUTLAW] *Wonder what will happen to her... effects when she passes.*
*A stone door lies flush with the floorboards. Etched whorls in the granite frame a delicate rotary dial. Gleaming under the dim light, the metallic dial almost seems to &lt;i&gt;wink&lt;/i&gt; at you.*
*He takes a moment to gather himself.*
*Say you&apos;re fine with him asking questions... so long as his subject stays in one piece.*
He&apos;s gone. He can&apos;t hurt me anymore. I can &lt;i&gt;leave!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell Han you need some time to recover from your ordeal in Fort Joy.*
*Growl that he can frame this however he likes - you won&apos;t let him get away with murder.*
*Beast begins rifling through his pack, then produces the wedding invitation acquired in Driftwood and hands it to her.*
[IFAN] *Tell him his parents taught him well; he should stay far away from you.*
*Refuse. You&apos;re not here to indulge him.*
*Explain where she can find the barrel.*
Shrine to Braccus
You&apos;re positively haunting me with your presence of late. Something I can help you with?
Now is a time for grief. Grief and... looking toward the future. Take rest, my friend. You deserve it. And you need it.
Deal [1]. If your Physical Armour is higher than your opponent&apos;s, destroy all their Physical Armour. Can set Knocked Down.
*Take your leave.*
This intricately designed orb is festooned with swirls of gold and looks like it cost a pretty penny. In delicate script is written: &apos;The gods bestow health on those who reject material possessions.&apos; Sure they do.
Enjoying the show?
If you&apos;d seen &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, you&apos;d know to keep your fingers as far from his jaws as you could...
*Say that you&apos;re sure you can get her to talk. She&apos;s only human, after all...*
And if it would not be acceptable... well, that would render this entire conversation rather awkward.
My word. A Godwoken. I&apos;m almost... honoured. There are precious few things in this world that elude me, but divinity is very much one of them...
Mmm... a fine specimen to the eye, and yet finer still to the touch...
Buzz OFF, pipsquawk!
[1] Earth Damage
Undead Elf Elementalist
Don&apos;t cry, Yarrow girl. Daddy&apos;s here.
*The old man mutters soundlessly on.*
*Tell them that that&apos;s all very interesting, but you need to go.*
Clearly.
Yes, by all means let us partake in the art of conversation.
The Mask of the Shapeshifter? In my time it was nothing more than a novelty. A toy, really.
I say we end divinity. I say we extinguish the flame and forget about a new Divine ascending. No &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; person should have that power.
We came across a pair of wargs, chewing on a large gem.
You met that squirmy little twit, Borris, yes? What icky little &lt;i&gt;favours &lt;/i&gt;did he manage to squeeze out of you for the aid?
You disappoint me. But I will not ask you to leave. Never let it be said that Paulina Kemm is a discourteous hostess.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;Here rests the Lizard Hero, Vydia. She served Lucian the Divine with great dignity, and vanquished the strange beasts that arose from the primordial caverns of Reaper&apos;s Coast. The implements of her heroism shall rest at the site of her victory.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
