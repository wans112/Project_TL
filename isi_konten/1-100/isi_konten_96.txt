*The presence within needs to grow, and it will show you how. But first, you must learn to protect yourself. You are not alone any longer.*
Honour to Lucian, and to his chosen apostle.
*Try to communicate. What has happened to it? How can you help?*
The brooding gaze of a bearded man sears into your mind. Investigation of the plaque beneath shows this to be an artist&apos;s interpretation of Rhalic, one of the Seven.
I have no illusions that history will look kindly upon me. My only goal is to guarantee that &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; should survive to write such histories.
*The pocked and lichened statue gazes down from under a canopy of overgrown ivy. It has clearly been an age since the stone has been tended here. Tiny spiders run the length of the statue&apos;s outstretched arms.*
Ah, Tir-Cendelius, worshipped by my people.
...should you choose to. So let me rid you of the darkness and leave you with a decision greater than us all: the divinity or humanity of your soul.
A vile-scented draught capable of dialling your speed down to &apos;tortoise&apos;.
You&apos;re welcome to try, though I doubt it&apos;ll help.
I&apos;ve killed many, but there are more. Free me. Free me, Godwoken! Release me and receive Lucian&apos;s favour. We&apos;re Godwoken, you and I. Practically brothers! Free me and we&apos;ll save Lucian from the traitors!
Anytime, chief. Any time at all.
*Hesitate. Tell him It&apos;s a terrible weight to place on one woman&apos;s shoulders.*
Done with these hills, done with Voidwoken, and done with whatever rotten magic took my friends. I need a drink...
There&apos;s a Swornbreaker scythe somewhere in the Kemm estate. It&apos;ll free me from the Covenant. I&apos;d be mortal, yes. But no longer a slave.
Take care of yourself, Godwoken. I may not always be there to do it for you.
*Heed the warning and step away.*
Then there was a voice, promises of protection and power in kingdom come... I became sworn to the God King, but when I saw his followers - the vilest creatures one could conceive - I realised how poisoned his gifts would be.
You and he possess a common foe. The power behind the Voidwoken has made our lives hell - so to speak - since the Divine Order unleashed Deathfog against the Black Ring and those darling woodland creatures.
You wanna make chit-chat? The world&apos;s burning, and you&apos;re asking about the weather?
Someone makes a real mess around here. I suspect it might be you...
*He grins, and waves his hand dismissively.*
Poor Marge. Hand it over. I&apos;ll take good care of Peeper. Poor thing is frightfully cold. Come here, little one!
*This figurehead is dangerous - back away from it.*
I... I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re going to accuse me of killing the mood, but... I need to talk to you about the Master.
You speak the spell with brash ferocity, like I knew you would, my prince.
*She peers at you through narrow eyes. Her next words do not pass her lips yet pierce your ears as if she&apos;d spoken them.*
An electrical bolt falls from the sky, dealing [1] to characters in the area and setting Shocked status.
*The glass is black... at first... but then a sickly haze begins to form, like sand upon a pond. The haze shimmers and becomes... a face. A wan-faced stranger looking straight at you.*
*You turn away and mark the location on your map.*
Use th&apos; best wood I can find. Good rosewood ain&apos;t too common, but lutes made from it croon like songbirds.
I guess this means I can leave.
*The spirit breathes a spooky sigh.*
*The poet tips his floppy hat to you as he counts the coin you handed over.*
You have freed me again. I won&apos;t forget. This I promise.
*Ask what he means by &apos;lost&apos; exactly.*
I will. Once I have my answers...
Bone Pile
Well, lookit that! Nice o&apos; you to finish the job after I - erm - loosened &apos;er up.
I&apos;m a wealthy man, and wealthy men need protection, especially if they &lt;i&gt;accompany&lt;/i&gt; their wealth.
Balance Offer

Because I have the upper hand. This is my territory. I saw the end of Arhu here. I&apos;ll see the end of the Godwoken too.

Focus on your breathing, Jules... slow and deep.
*Ask aloud: Who&apos;s there?*
The password is &apos;fortitude&apos;.
*You sigh...*
*Say you came across Gareth not too long ago. He was having some trouble with an old friend of his - Jonathan, by name.*
*The young girl&apos;s eyes are covered, but she turns toward you when you approach. She smiles as though she recognises you, though she couldn&apos;t have seen your face.*
Pike
Party Management
*Say you seek your own destiny. Let each dwarf map his own.*
And you, the Red Prince, the Lizard Divine.
Projectile(s)
*He struggles to his feet.*
Wha- what&apos;s tha&apos;? Here, no - get back! Get away from me, yeh demon!
This is relieving news on the most difficult of days.
Escaped?! H-hold still. I need to... I need to apprehend you!
Hm. You don&apos;t look very divine to me. What are you waiting for?
Something&apos;s off about this one. Let&apos;s make sure he can do no harm.
Besides, he was seen with the effects of one of our company. I dread to think how he came about them.
*The dog growls and bares its teeth at you in a wide, unsettling grin. You swear you see a worm emerge from its gray-pink gums, then burrow back in.*
Oh Leya, yeh sweet girl. I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m so sorry...
Someone had themselves a ball. Let&apos;s find out if they&apos;ll dance with us as well.
*The older-looking Magister notices your presence and does a double-take. He squints and peers at you closely before shaking his head.*
*Tell him that his disloyalty to the God King has its consequences. He&apos;ll just have to live - or not live - with them.*

I hope you love your bell, my friend. Its chimes help you find what you seek. Or help what you seek find you!
The Seeker Gareth has a comrade who can remove my Source collar.
You cannot stand against the Shriekers. Not without stronger weapons than these.
You&apos;ve got skill, my friend. Let&apos;s focus it on a righteous cause, shall we?
This archer&apos;s guide is bound with fletching leather.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a compendium of exquisite drawings detailing how to craft a variety of innovative and unusual arrows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scrawled in the margins, you notice a handwrittern note, underlined thrice:&lt;br&gt;REMEMBER: POINT THE SHARP BIT TOWARDS THE ENEMY!&lt;br&gt;

*Any lingering cheer in the spirit&apos;s expression vanishes in an instant.*
*The love-making. Say that&apos;s what you were jealous of.*
[FANE] *Transactional or not, the idea of &apos;friendship&apos; does sound appealing...*
Squeak! &lt;i&gt;Sqquuueak!!!&lt;/i&gt;
A fella can&apos;t hear himself think with all this racket! Day and night she hollers after that child!
Nothing&apos;s changed, but for our surroundings. We&apos;re still on an island, in dire need of making for the mainland.
*Ask what the Queen has to do with any of this.*
*Her lip wobbles. Big fat tears leak out of the corners of her eyes.*
Firelamp
Without &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, you would&apos;ve died in a shipwreck before you even got to Fort Joy. I have been good to you, Lohse. Remember that.
Breath from the Depths
*Tell her you&apos;ll never forget her.*
Oh, you want a list?
You look almost exactly like every other creature of your race. Doubly so, now that you&apos;re dead.

Poison Summon
Traitor! I&apos;m coming for you!
The loser, well...
Why on earth would I do that? I have reading to do.
The Lady Amadia has laid out the plight of the world and begged me to help fix it.
*Scoff and say you&apos;re most likely nothing but an aberration.*
Get your damn dirty claws off me!
*A senior Paladin sits hunched over a tattered map. He registers your presence. Sits back in his chair. Taps his fingers on the map.*
*The nurse gives you a mischievious little grin. Black liquid trickles slowly from the corner of his mouth.*
*The parchment stares back.*
The demon-hunter Jahan asked us to kill the demonic &apos;Advocate&apos; on Bloodmoon Island.
Isn&apos;t it obvious? Some thoughtless fool buried me in this grave, like some common human! I can&apos;t be at peace in a place like this; I have to be put to rest according to lizard tradition!
*She eagerly returns your kiss, long and sweet as rosewater.*
[1] joined!
I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like dwarves, for instance.
Rainbow
Thanks for your time. Keep your wits about you. It&apos;s easy to find trouble, even when you aren&apos;t looking for it.
A grenade that magically induces seismicity, causing [1] to all within a [2] range.
With Justinia dead, the dwarven kingdom descended into chaos. They did not join the Divine Alliance. When the demons came, the dwarves were ill-prepared. Few survived.
*She kisses you gently. Then, as your mouths open, a dalliance of tongues.*
DAMN YOU! I&apos;ll flay you alive! I&apos;ll flense the blubber from your bones!

*Ask how he remains so proud while imprisoned like this.*
*Explore the spirit&apos;s memories.*
&lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; didn&apos;t kill anybody! The Magisters who control them did! You know Donna... she wouldn&apos;t hurt a fly. Not until they turned her...
*Reach for your weapon. Gareth wants him dead - and you&apos;re happy to make it happen.*
We&apos;re as right as rain, aren&apos;t we. Right as rain!
Be wary... death hangs in the air.
*Step aside.*
*Its urgency echoes within your mind as it compels you: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Seek a shrine, seek me!&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
But be warned - bypassing Lucian&apos;s statue is just the beginning. I may be able to forewarn you of the dangers you&apos;ll face, but you must still face them.
Just another parasite, then. We&apos;ll get to you once the witch is dealt with.
Higba provided us with some information about powerful Sourcerers - the kind who might be able to help us.
*Divine? Ask him if he intends you to replace him.*
Bye-bye, mister lady missus.
Your comrade is not free to fight. You wait. Then you fight.
He keeps it locked away somewhere in that mansion of his. A masterpiece like that should be on public display for all to see!
I killed him slow. Preserves the flavour.
Straffan&apos;s the one you want - he isn&apos;t to be tangled with lightly.
Then your book is shite.

You&apos;ve helped us a great deal today. I... nearly lost my father forever. Thank you.
I see. You have my thanks for that. You did us a great service.
