*Before you can say a word, she pushes a warm bowl into your hands. The distinctive aroma of pumpkin wafts up from it.*
*Deep inside, the voice hisses in anger. &apos;Do it!&apos; It snarls. &apos;All will be well, just do it...&apos;*
If there&apos;s one thing better than a pair of familiar lips, it&apos;s the sight of a familiar face! We were good together once, wouldn&apos;t ya say? Then I propose we be good together again!
I&apos;m sorry, darling. You&apos;ve missed the fun.
*You kiss. You kiss and you keep kissing, entangled in one another&apos;s arms.*
And if their barracks turns out to be empty as their skulls, just keep your eye-sockets peeled. There may still be powerful Sourcerers hiding in these lands.
It&apos;s good to see you. Let&apos;s talk.
I am. Yeah, I really am.
*Gareth lowers his arm, but it continues to tremble.*
*Object - you&apos;re not about to turn on your travelling companions. They are good creatures, in their own way.*
If we can make it to the Swamps, there&apos;s a weapon waiting for me. My contract aside, I&apos;d say getting out from under the prying eyes of the Magisters would be helpful for all kinds of reasons...
*Chuckle sarcastically. You will not be intimidated by feeble threats.*
Unassuming Gravestone
This won&apos;t be the first double-cross. I&apos;m a wanted woman.
Confront the Red Princess.
One might say I&apos;m a bit of a sucker for poetic justice.
[JESTER] *Fish a stick from your pack, throw it, and shout &apos;fetch!&apos; at the creature.*
*She cocks her head and smiles.*
Get away from me. You&apos;re already dead. You&apos;re eaten alive. Eaten alive! &lt;i&gt;Get away from me!&lt;/i&gt;
Yeah, no thanks. One sparkly green hate-necklace is enough.
*Tell him if he ever wants to see the Halls he&apos;ll stop ringing the damned bell.*
Invisible to enemies until you cross their cone of sight.
Mordus Awakens
*He reaches out one scarred hand to touch your face, gentle as can be.*
*Turn away.*
I don&apos;t need your dirty money - just your head!
&lt;i&gt;Oh no you don&apos;t.&lt;/i&gt;
So &lt;i&gt;close&lt;/i&gt; to the dream. It&apos;s been so long. You wouldn&apos;t understand. Please - please leave me be.
Some other Sourcerers have abandoned the ship; we managed to escape in the nick of time.

Protect her, for she is the mother of dragons! Protect her, for she carries your children in her blessed womb!
One of the &lt;i&gt;gods &lt;/i&gt;said that?
|Resistances are equalized between you and nearby allies. Does not affect summoned creatures. Range 10m.|
Conjure a demon that will share their Intelligence with you and provide [1]. Grants you power to terrify and protect yourself with demonic fists.
Plus you got a roll in the hay with Zharat here into the bargain.
Exploration Theme 04 Light B
This place is still swarming with these creeps. We can chat when they&apos;re dead.
The dog is dead.
*Note the number of bodies littering the deck. Ask how many were lost in the battle.*
Scientific Theories on Deathfog
This is &lt;i&gt;strictly &lt;/i&gt;a Divine Order matter, longstocking. Very, very strictly.
Some people... settle in. They don&apos;t go poking around in Griff&apos;s kitchen. They find a quiet place. Wait their turn.
Coin Purse
Now let us begin.
You are either naive or ignorant, Godwoken. Lucian overcame the Demon of Lies to become our saviour, our father of truth. Malice is... was not in his nature.
This place has been ransacked!
...because owning a head is a terrible thing.
Yet consumed by hist&apos;ry&apos;s foulest chapters...
Parents are the best. They take care of you and make sure nothing can hurt you. And when they leave, you&apos;re all alone.
To save a life. Ah - that elven fellow in the cage, I suppose. I knew he&apos;d been suspected, but... but it all seemed worth it if I could only &lt;i&gt;dream &lt;/i&gt;again.
*Promise to do as he bids.*
What is this contraption...?
Another inmate, but you wouldn&apos;t guess it. Runs this place like he&apos;s Dallis herself. Shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find him in the kitchen. He may even have work for a strong back like yours.
[Intelligence Persuasion]
Your blood is mine. Your life is mine. YOU DIE.
If it would be acceptable, I have an enquiry for this human. It is of a... personal nature.
Lifeless?! This painting is the essence of life, you fool!
Bleeding collar... it&apos;s stuck fast!
*Yank the lid of the jar open and feast on the soul inside.*
War raged on.
Report back to the Paladins.
Be wary. This demon knows no decency. No remorse...
*Stall for time. Ask for the details of this Sourcerer&apos;s crimes. Shouldn&apos;t he be sent to Fort Joy?*
Current:
But... if you are to return, I need to make sure you remain in one piece. So let me share another morsel of information I&apos;ve picked up on my travels.
Tir-Cendelius might have been known the poet, but it still seems strange to write about him on what used to be a tree...
*He tugs back the sleeve of his tunic to reveal a bloodsoaked cloth bandage around his wrist.*
Petals, ribbons and luscious scents, no. But you look like a man who appreciates the darker things in life.
War is hell, my friend, but it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;good for business. Good luck to ya.
Gotta get movin&apos;, &apos;n&apos; quick, but I feel all hungover. And I ain&apos;t been hungover since I was a youngun&apos;.
I&apos;ll find ways to excite myself. Always do. First, I go back to the kingdom. The queen is dead and the court&apos;ll be in tatters. I&apos;ve got to find out what needs done, and get to doin&apos; it.
*Hesitate. Tell him you&apos;re not sure you want to part with such a valuable item.*
Like sticks? Balls? Understand, I understand.
*Fane nods curtly and turns away, notebook in hand.*
Great power is trapped inside this armour. There must be a way to unlock it.
I? &lt;i&gt;She &lt;/i&gt;is the one that comes to me, helm in hand, in a sad attempt to beg and snivel her way out of previous, and quite binding, contracts.
Thick of the Fight
Nah. Nice, quiet spot fer a dwarf to get some shut-eye.
I warned you already, lizard - this is no place for you!
Shell
GOOD! Heretics deserve only death.
Well, bye then.
Vault
I wonder where it leads.
Don&apos;t hurt me!&lt;br&gt;
Persuasion: Charm, Intimidate or Reason with Party Members
*Perhaps he has a point. Take your leave.*
*Shake your head. You need to talk to Alexandar yourself.*
Sublime Skin
We were informed by a Sourcerer named Jeth that Erma isn&apos;t missing - she was killed in a Voidwoken attack some time ago.
[ELF] *Ask about his travels. Did he see the majestic home of the elves before the Deathfog destroyed it all?*
Y-yes sir!
Options
Back, &lt;i&gt;back!&lt;/i&gt; Keep that crazy brute away from me!
*Speaking of which, tell her you seek Amadia&apos;s altar.*
If you want anything read to you, I&apos;d be happy to help.
*Decline. You found it - it&apos;s yours.*
But he&apos;s a real sweetheart once you get to know him. I loved that password of his, &lt;i&gt;&apos;Open Minds and Closed Fists&apos;.&lt;/i&gt;
Do as she says. Lower your spear.
I figured I&apos;d find something unusual, but no such luck.
&apos;cause that&apos;s where all the queer ones go. Clankin&apos; dwarves, dozy lizards - I even saw &apos;em drag a Voidwoken down there in the dead o&apos; night!
Neep neep. Neep.
Light Helmet
[IFAN] *Through clenched teeth, mutter &lt;i&gt;&apos;Over my dead body.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Go to Lucian&apos;s Tomb, my friend. Divine revelation awaits you.
*...then a smile creases his face. A smile carefully constructed to look friendly and authentic. A smile that doesn&apos;t reach his eyes.*
Or, indeed, you could stand there like a stage-struck peasant. If you&apos;re waiting for me to applaud and cry encore, you may be disappointed. I am in no position to clap.
Ingredients
[HUMAN] *Ask him for a little leniency for your group, man to man.*

The Sourcerer Hannag was last seen fleeing for the Cloisterwood, Magisters in pursuit.
*Gareth fingers the hilt of his blade. He stares at nothing in particular before turning his gaze back to you.*
Crawling Kiss
Mystical Medium Masterwork Rune
*The spirit lowers her head - despondent and unresponsive.*
So - are we? Allies, that is.
*The elf reaches towards you to continue his examination, and you slap his hand down. Apparently, this guy doesn&apos;t get jokes.*
I aim to save &lt;i&gt;every &lt;/i&gt;life. To do that I must dream. That is all. Now. Good day.
*Shout at Jahan to move away.*
System Storage: [1] / [2]
*The vision fades and once again you find yourself at the altar, faint embers of ash scorching the fabric of your clothes.*
Arrow Static Cloud
What I do best: making bows and arrows. Roost was a fan of my work and... well, he forced me to work for him. Gods... this means I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt;.
He who has run his fingers along beguiling demon skin...
Oooh, very clever, he was, in his way. Couldn&apos;t talk at all, but ke&apos;t his wits a&apos;out hi&apos;... was very intelligent, I &apos;ean to say.
Keep an eye out for secret passages. Rivellon is full of hidden levers, pressure plates and mysterious hatches. Try walking through the hanging vines...
We learned that there&apos;s some method to free the spirits from the armour, but have yet to uncover it.
Ha.

*As she speaks, one of her wounds reopens, a dark red stain spreading across her tunic. She hisses in frustration and starts to bind the gash.*
Wand Of Nature
You&apos;re just aching for trouble, aren&apos;t you?
Unusual Platemail Boots
This blazing wand surges with macabre energy, creating necrofire wherever your willpower demands it manifest.
Ah, nobody again. Didn&apos;t make myself clear the first time? Scram.
Helping the thugs won us no friends. Perhaps we should talk to their boss, Griff.
*Ask the spirit of Baran Levere why a Lone Wolf murdered him.*
You? You again? Are you scouting for eggs?
*The memory fades. Yet you still feel the resolve of your host - the righteous anger, the expanse of the Void. They are as real as the sea you have sailed and the Source you command.*
*Salute him and say his superior sent you. He&apos;s to report to the upper deck.*
Accursed Wand
Let her cower on that ship of hers and be glad the water&apos;s too foul for me to swim.
Rune Dagger
*Smile and say you&apos;d like to try her riddle after all.*
Many fine and courageous dwarves did their people great honour, in battle and in death.
No, you beautiful idiot! That wasn&apos;t any rat. It was the &lt;i&gt;wheel&lt;/i&gt;. Squeaks whenever the helmsmen jerks it clockwise, which means we&apos;re heading east.
Here...
The final sacrifice.
Wonderful! Then let us pray! I pledge my heart, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my soul, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my life, O Lucian, please return.
*Say you&apos;re glad you didn&apos;t let her keep a cent of your money, then.*
*As you pick up the ring, you feel a cold, dark pain shoot up through the bones of your arm. Your mind itches...*
*Wait. You&apos;d like to know who you&apos;re dealing with: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Who are you?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*A cloud of purest black breaks through. The chill of death, then its very visage: the pale skull at the heart of the Void. This is the God King himself.*
Hey, wanna play?
*He points towards the northeast. You see nothing in that direction but grey water and a thick mist in which ghoulish shapes seem to form and fade.*

[FANE] *Express your admiration of such an argus-eyed custodian and congratulate her on her acutely veracious replication.*
Sometimes you will be able to persuade the person you are talking to. Your answer, your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;stats&lt;/font&gt; and your persuasion ability will decide how successful you will be.
