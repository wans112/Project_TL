I suppose it were a fool&apos;s errand, thinkin&apos; I could make somethin&apos; outta this heap, but I couldn&apos;t help myself from tryin&apos;.
Ah - you again. Any luck in old lady Surrey&apos;s tomb?
*Insist you were guided here by a vision from Lucian himself!*
You were on that luckless lot of timber that met with one tentacle too many, weren&apos;t you? Yes, I remember licking your arm...
I kill a man, he knows who done it, his daddy knows who done it, and the mayor knows who done it too.
Go. Do what you must.
*He was weakening the Veil? Did it fail? Did they discover what was behind it?*
You gods-damned fink! What rat crawled up yer arse to stink you up so bad? My people&apos;s fate hung in the balance, &apos;n&apos; you might&apos;ve just dropped &apos;em into death&apos;s slobberin&apos; maw!
To strengthen himself, he sent his Voidwoken - the remnants of my people - to hunt down the Sourcerers, seeking to reclaim their Source.
*You are ever-sodden, ever-sandy. The smell of guts and sea-waste cling to you like a ghost. You sought freedom, the life of a seaman, but you didn&apos;t find it.*

I do not stand for this creeping around.
Braccus Rex invented the Shriekers. The Magisters put them to good use.
*You want to know about Kemm.*
Make haste to the Hall of Echoes, comrade...

*Tell him to trust you. Silent Monks aren&apos;t people anymore, they&apos;re puppets.*

How... what... - you are &lt;i&gt;unleashed?!&lt;/i&gt;
The truth can be difficult. We all want to believe in each other. It&apos;s what separates us from the Void. It&apos;s what makes our existence worthwhile.
&apos;His arrows fly true and straight into the burlap sack...&apos;
I don&apos;t need your dirty money, thief. You&apos;re under arrest!
First: A demonologist. My people reported he passed through here not long ago. Avoided the Magisters &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;carefully, that one.
Magister Orivand&apos;s Mace
Come, sister. What did you think was gonna happen?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
*hmm-hmm* ten spans under *mmm*
*Squint and try your best to figure out what he&apos;s talking about. You feel... hungry? And it&apos;s kind of humid.*
One thing is true - no-one has met him and returned to tell the tale.
*Ask about the bad dwarf things in the caves.*
I&apos;m very young. I&apos;m pretty sure I need my mum.
*Gniah!*
*Accede and tell Ifan you&apos;d like to work together to escape.*
*Rest a hand on one knee and lean towards him. Tell him to answer the godsdamned question.*
I don&apos;t know who you are, &apos;ut hear this: don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest. Don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest. Whatever you do, don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
*The Paladin hocks a gob of spittle onto the burning corpses of Silent Monks. The saliva sizzles momentarily and is gone.*
Exactly what I didn&apos;t want to read.
*Ask how she came to call this cloister her home.*
*Note that the creature mentioned Braccus Rex, that he punished this princess - what happened?*
You know what&apos;s a distasteful comparison? This world, where everyone&apos;s a Sourcerer and you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;nothing,&lt;/i&gt; really - and a world where you are the divine and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am your closest ally.
Attack_Ranged_6
Look around - would you be happy stuck guarding this bloody place? Ten years of service, and they stick me in a hole with a bunch of speechless goons...
I SO appreciate what you&apos;ve done for me. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I must... stretch my legs, so to speak.
The elven Scions are chosen to carry the memories of the Ancestor Trees, to safeguard elven culture.
Press [IE_ToggleSneak] to enter &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;sneak mode&lt;/font&gt; and steal some property while the owner isn&apos;t looking.
*Siva&apos;s face freezes, her eyes burning. She lets out a long, steady breath.*
What a wonderful song! How much do you want for the lute?
I hear you don&apos;t know when to keep your weapon sheathed. Funny thing: I&apos;ve got the same problem!
What is this? I do not understand... I searched for my love, but my love has gone... What am I?

Very long description goes here.
Follow Dorotya to her private place.
Bock! Ba-bock! BACAW!
Are you sure you want to confirm your changes?
*Shrug and say you have no reason not to.*
Dear one...
Dominate Mind Scroll
It is no safer outside of Fort Joy than it is within. This is no time for celebration.
Regardless, you asked me to show you how to channel more Source, and I offered you a solution. I did my part, and now I&apos;m leaving this cursed place.
The Ancient Empire isn&apos;t our real enemy. When Lucian returns, he will show us the true path.
Oh, but you are such a... delicate thing, aren&apos;t you? Very well. We&apos;ve given the wolves and worms enough to feast on. Besides...
Wait. Stop. Please. No! Not like this - not like this!
*Insist that whether she comes quietly or not, you won&apos;t leave her behind.*
Stuff. You know. Good stuff. Loot and that.
It matters not if they defeat every last lich whose bones have risen in my master&apos;s honour, Godwoken.
I welcome you, honoured one! Be at peace, for your day has come.
The only price I will accept is your life, fool!
Sewage Pipe
Indeed not, Your Majesty. But you live still, and by your own devices. A formidable feat, that much I assure you.
*The cook smiles at you as if you were a child.*
*Ask directions to the place where the thieves hang out.*
Pursue more philosophical learning.
*Shrug. Sure you kill. Who doesn&apos;t?*
Begone! &lt;i&gt;Begone &lt;/i&gt;from here! Ngh... where is my champion?!
Report back to Beryl Griff.

*The tallest, strongest elf, whom you take to be the leader, gives you a hint of a smile, then turns back to the task in hand.*
Just &lt;i&gt;watch &lt;/i&gt;yourself is what I mean.
No.
*Brush him off. You&apos;ve no time to worry about this right now.*
Manky human...
*Say they&apos;re okay - no more or less.*
*Radeka? Tell him the witch has perished!*
*Ask if Dallis is in the city.*
*The chirping of birds fades into the gentle, warm crackle of a wood fire. You&apos;re standing in an old cabin, the wood stained with age. Sitting in a rocking chair, bathed in moonlight, is Amadia.*
Alright, I won&apos;t press this further. Just don&apos;t make me regret this.

*Hard stone melts into cool water at your touch. Before you stretches a lake - or rather a mire. The waters are fetid and rotten, the air filled with choking miasma.*

Heeheehee!
My ballads could barely prick up a hound&apos;s ears. I prayed and begged for inspiration. I shouted into the darkness. And one day... the darkness shouted back. It - he - gave me what I wanted. The gift of perfect verse.
Hah! Removed your collar like a disobedient dog, I see! A very tall, very scaly dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.

They slip through your fingers, leaving a slimy, pungent and oddly warm residue. Wait, why are you touching them?
Arx was abandoned to the Deathfog and the dead. The great seat of Lucian&apos;s Divine Order faded from memory.
*She-... she knew? Ask how - your disguise is perfect.*
*You&apos;re not giving her a drop of Source! Refuse the sacrifice.*
What? Are you here to recommend I kill my wife too? Or my aunt? Or Her Majesty herself?
We&apos;re done here.
*He shakes his head in disbelief.*
*Rub your neck and nod, but keep your own counsel.*

With these powers you will have a choice. You can help our people, or you can dash them to ruin.
Oh and you know you can come talk to me if you want something that&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; blow your socks off. Nudge nudge, wink wink, guv&apos;nor!
[LIZARD] *Hesitatingly admit that you see flaws in your people&apos;s use of slavery after your time in Fort Joy. The ship is free - an equal and an ally.*
A word of warning to you, ben-Mezd, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait  - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
*The captain snaps his fingers with a sharp clack. Bones clatter as his arm comes alive, climbing toward its master.*

*Say she&apos;s probably right, but there&apos;s no sense in giving up just yet.*
*Even if you could use this thing, you probably shouldn&apos;t.*
A beating heart? Does Braccus need us once more, jailor? Are we finally to be freed?
&lt;i&gt;I feel how tightly you grasp. To the fear. To the fight. &lt;/i&gt;
Right you are. Better save the world first...
Warning from Dallis
Tell me, what did you see? What to know?
My fingers are yours. Direct them!
Hmm. Very well. But I&apos;ve got my eye on you. If you get into trouble, trust me: I&apos;ll know.
&apos;It just happened&apos; that you doom &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;our people.
Ifan... ben-Mezd? I&apos;ve heard about you. Quite a lot, actually. I doubt very much Roost&apos;d mind if you had a look at my wares, indeed.
*Wish them luck and take your leave.*
Find the portrait, the cup, and the scroll.
*Nod. You are Duna&apos;s chosen.*
*Move a bit closer and place a hand upon her knee.*
Keep distant, mortal. When the craving ends, when my freedom is secured, I will again see you rewarded.
But fine. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;talk to the greased up ape. See what I care.
The Gods won&apos;t be removing that collar from your throat, however. With Leya gone... I have no means of helping. Find a way to rip that thing from your throat. We need your power. We need your Source.
*The word &apos;NO!&apos; fades away with the echoes of the bell, and the Spirit of Seaman Stubbs is no more.*
I&apos;ve noticed you have a habit of taking what isn&apos;t yours. And I don&apos;t believe in second chances.
Some days have no meaning. Some &lt;i&gt;lives &lt;/i&gt;have no meaning. When a child dies, the trees themselves weep.
Just arrived, and I like you already.
May the Seven keep him. May they keep all of us!
*Ask who they are and what they were doing here, before he goes any further.*
Now that we&apos;re in, we should search Dallis&apos; stateroom thoroughly.
For you, &lt;i&gt;rava&lt;/i&gt;, no bother. As you know, it&apos;ll cost a little gold... if you have it to spare. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*The sadness in her face fades, to be replaced by a hard look. She produces, in one hand, a dagger.*
Anyhoo, let&apos;s just get it out there: I&apos;m a bastard. The literal kind &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the other kind. The royals weren&apos;t all great with me - and I weren&apos;t too great with them.
No- please! You can&apos;t- please - don&apos;t!
The names on my left arm: several I killed with pleasure.
&lt;i&gt;I am no elf! &lt;/i&gt;Don&apos;t you call me that!
Weaver
Did you expect that to work? Are you used to dealing with idiots? I know you are hiding something.
You would swear on our ruler&apos;s LIFE?! You may &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like a dwarf, but dwarven blood cannot run in the veins of one who would say a thing like that.
*Indeed. You met with her, lay with her. Say she&apos;ll soon be the mother of dragons.*
Do you need anything more?
Ah, Godwoken.
May Gareth always choose the right path.
*The healer looks at you for a long moment, a skeptical eyebrow cocked upwards...*
*Ask why she doesn&apos;t mask herself. If it isn&apos;t too indelicate a question, that is.*
