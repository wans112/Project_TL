*But the Voidwoken offers him a chance to redeem himself - to rejoin his people. If he accepts the God King&apos;s covenant, all will be forgiven.*
[BEAST] *Tell him he can call you &apos;Beast&apos;.*
*Tell Windego you will bring her a Swornbreaker scythe, if ever you should find one.*
[IFAN] *You know better than to approach a woman with that level of intensity in her eyes. You wait. You watch.*
*Tell the elf she should pay up; rules are rules.*
Yes, I am familiar with the feeling.
*Ask what you&apos;re supposed to be looking for.*
*Tell him it&apos;s time to set sail himself - his life is over, he can go to the Hall of Echoes.*
*He growls deeply and backs away from you, keeping mistrustful eyes trained upon you.*
*A grim-faced man sorts through damaged weapons. He doesn&apos;t look up.*
Credence I should have given them a long time ago! Make no mistake: I am to be the father of dragons, and she, the Red Princess, is to be the mother.
Dunno why she&apos;d call you a Godwoken - unless you was.
*He tips his temple in salute. For a moment a black smoke-snake coils around his fist... and then is gone.*
It&apos;s just... I just...
Wait and watch, as he commands.
I know a trick when I see one.
*She pulls herself free of your grasp. Terror in her eyes, she stumbles away.*
Very well: in that case we&apos;ll forego the gallows and turn straight to the hunt! No doubt a trustee of Dallis is champing at the bit to see some action.
*Important pieces? Ask what he means.*
Whoah. How&apos;d you do that?
Please fill in a valid name for your character to continue.
She is the most blessed mother of magic. The fount from which all wizardry springs.
Fair enough. But I can&apos;t walk beside you, then. I need more than a companion. I need... I need someone I can trust to do what needs to be done.
*She yanks away your pack and fishes the evidence from it.*
*Ask how she knows you - who is she?*
Now listen here. I&apos;ll make it easy for you: you&apos;re gonna dig into your pockets and fish out a nice pile of shiny ones. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54] gold)
Hell if I know.
*Ask if you could lend a hand in the investigation.*
Of course it wasn&apos;t, but you don&apos;t have to hold back on the details. I see them all.
Executed Civilian
I will link you. You will hear them. They will feed you. Increase the Source in you. Increase the power.
Then she is safe, thank Duna&apos;s bushy bristles. I will attend to her as soon as I can.
*Frowns...* You are not of the Black Ring.
*The God King? Who does he mean by that?*
[VILLAIN] *Tell her that sounds like fun.*
*Take your leave.*
He&apos;s a master Sourcerer. Everyone knows &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. But he&apos;s too powerful to take to the Joy.
I saw it as I drifted here, at the midpoint between reality and oblivion...
*The ghostly stag inclines its antlered head towards you.*
Driftwood Arena Champion Key
The Black Ring flocked to him after Lucian unleashed his Deathfog. The Undead stand by him because he offers them a return to life. I don&apos;t know why the Voidwoken flock to him...
Leather Breeches
Become invisible for a short while.
*Claim that you were only cleaning it.*
*Say you&apos;re simply exploring, rather than pursuing objectives.*
We are all slaves to survival, and all survival is ultimately selfish.
Secret Wall Close
Hmmm. Let&apos;s just say killing a bunch of lowly dwarves is... beneath me.
*Mewl...*
Come now, be reasonable. This is it: the moment of prophecy and dragons! There is simply no way that you&apos;d risk our friendship by driving a wedge between me and Sadha at this juncture.
My husband&apos;s actions are his own. I &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;/i&gt; condone them.
*The leader scowls at you sidelong.*
*Ask the ship if it - &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;- wishes to remain in this state, after all is done, or if she wants a release.*
Undead! To arms, in the Hammer&apos;s name!
My! By a scion, you say. What a delightful plot twist!
Pray, tell me, what do you think you know?
*Roost moves to lunge at you, but Ifan is quicker. With two steps and three stabs, he slows Roost down just long enough for you to draw your weapon...*
Default Deck
*She breathes deeply into the pouch and begins to calm.*
I&apos;m a Seeker. Name&apos;s Gareth. And I dare say you&apos;re a Sourcerer. I can give you shelter... and hope.
I love my work. I love the possibilities of it all - the idea of engineering something to perfection... but one aspect always fails me. People. Fallable, mortal, irrational &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;.
[BARBARIAN] *Call out to the shaking Magister, telling her to hurry this up; you&apos;re hungry.*
Between you and me, fancy pants, I&apos;ll still take a slaver like yerself over the Reds any day!
I&apos;ll call you... um... Shadow Raven for the moment.
*Demand to know who this cloaked figure, this Vredeman, truly is.*
*It grips its hands, pleading with you as you open your arms wide and drag her kicking, screaming soul into your own.*
Bench
The people of Rivellon will call you their Saviour. You gave them the freedom you enjoyed at sea. And there will come a time when they rebel, just as you did - and the price will be high.
[Arena_AvailablePlayer_2_f3cb5f2b-c0ca-4b36-b671-dd64d481f45d]
I see you.
You dare refuse, even after Saheila? You are still a killer of elves? You would doom us all?
*Swear you are no Magister. All she can do is take your word for it.*
*Dip your head towards him. Fix him with a steady gaze. Give him a reassuring smile. Tell him you&apos;re a Lone Wolf, and you&apos;re here to get paid. Then ask for his orders.*
I do not require your fear, mortal. Merely your life.
*Look around you. What is this place, exactly?*
Looks like this is Lohar&apos;s place. Or what&apos;s left of it...
Let&apos;s get this over with, shall we?
Honestly, making the dead do menial work sounds kinder than having the living do it...
Spirit Vision
*Tell him you&apos;ll come back to him.*
Move along!
We gave Eithne the book. She was grateful, and left to blow herself up and set her soul free.
Staff
I hear you shall be the new Mother, Scion. We have hope now.
Little Loretta
[LOHSE] *Say he can call you Lohse, if he can behave himself.*
Oh, I&apos;m blushing! You just can&apos;t tell because I&apos;m already so...pink.
[1] increases your ability to resist fear by [2]%.
Mabel the cow took our potion and turned back into a woman. A talented recipe-writer, she&apos;ll happily share her wisdom with us.
*Lie and say you knew him in life. He was a proud peacock of a man. He needed to be put in his place.*
Max Characters Per Player
*Ask why she&apos;s so angry at Lohar. She chose this life.*
*He peers into your eyes, looking for a sign of honest intent - and satisfied, his face softens.*
[UNDEAD] *Admit that you&apos;re not... entirely... alive.*
*Let &lt;i&gt;it &lt;/i&gt;loose. Let it speak with your lips.*
[Opening the book, you read the description of attempts to exorcise a child. It seems the priests were quickly overwhelmed by the demons within. They were never able to find even an echo of the child&apos;s soul.]
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are not one of mine. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are not one of the remaining.
*The spirit of a Magister trembles before you, his eyes glazed with fear.*
There shouldn&apos;t be anything more important to you than your honour.
In a hurry, are you? On your way to Arx, like we are? Oh, we wouldn&apos;t miss Lucian&apos;s Day for the world!
The God King offered a Covenant, and the treacherous four-faced skeleton accepted.
*Ask if they&apos;re stolen.*
*Nod and say that&apos;s exactly your point. The Magisters are the elite - if he was here they would &lt;i&gt;surely&lt;/i&gt; have found him by now.*
*Tell him you&apos;re not going to feed his habit.*
When I asked about a face-ripping tool the simpleton blacksmith was very upset. I hope this &apos;Kniles&apos; is more open-minded.
Bucket
...what do you know of our great work? What&apos;s the camp gossip about our cure...?
Curtains
Jagged and chitinous, like the claw of some primeval beast, this blade could be quite the prize... yet its shaft is missing.
Exterminator
No ranged weapon equipped&lt;br&gt;
*Ignoring the look in his eyes, effusively thank Ifan for his help in reaching this moment.*
*Agree. Impressive.*
A Crumpled Note
Hrrm. After something?
[LOHSE] *Tell Han you intend to get off this island; you have a private matter to work out.*
Why would I obey such a god?
On Map
Accompany me back to my empire and I&apos;ll tell them all in the palatial setting they deserve.
*Hand her the Soul Jar with a name that you don&apos;t recognise.*
The infamous Beast was invited to the party? Can&apos;t see that happening. Well, your not getting in this way. See the guard in the general store - she can be the one to run you off like the dog you are.
Are you seriously asking me that question?
&lt;i&gt;Do not sing that song for me! The fight is not yet done!&lt;/i&gt;
Are you ready to tell the truth this time, little Sourcerer? You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a Godwoken, no?
*He dismisses you with a flick of a wrist.*
*Her mind goes black. She had no other choice.*
Suffocating
*Her eyes brim with tears. Her lower lip wobbles.*
Deals [1] and sets Diseased, which reduces Constitution and damage.
Tarquin? Ah. That must be the fellow I found snooping in unwanted places.
Cleave Angle
*Tell the cows you&apos;ll give the potion to whichever one is most deserving.*
Oh come on, this is bull - !
[OUTLAW] *Mutter that you&apos;ve seen Divine Order &apos;justice.&apos; You almost pity the Sourcerer.*
It&apos;s broken.
*Triumphantly tell him that Marg is dead.*
The Magisters are using their Black Ring enemies to excavate the Blackpits. They must be looking for something important.
Farewell, lass!
Don&apos;t dilly dally, my dear. You don&apos;t need me to tell you that the clock is ticking.
*He seems hesitant. Ask what&apos;s wrong.*
*Shake your head and demand she explain how she knew you&apos;re a Sourcerer.*
Duly noted! Now, there&apos;s just one more question on my list for now:&lt;br&gt;
Fan of Knives
From the depths of the Void, the God King still sought to return.
And we cheered.
Spirit of Cursed Knight of Duna
We can&apos;t stay here. The Magisters will keep looking. They&apos;ll never stop.
*The sister has found peace with what was her life, but her brother rages on. The rebellion was a disaster. His sister&apos;s treason cost them their lives.*
*Snarl that he&apos;s not in any position to bargain.*
Please.
*I would take more time to prepare.*
Not you.
*His cruel, scraping, booming laughter echoes inside your mind. He turns to you and grins. You have chosen wisely...*
AP Cost
*Light suddenly flashes back into her face. The grey veins drain to pinkish flesh, and her whole body relaxes.*
...my boots are not going to clean themselves.
And I would destroy all, had I the power to will it so.
Breaker
Mabel&apos;s Stash
*Ask what happened here.*
I am... Braccus Rex. &lt;b&gt;I am the Source King&lt;/b&gt;!
The world is mine! It&apos;s mine because I say it is.
A deal, you have.
You escaped an abominable prison and confronted the King of all gods, only for Divinity to slip your grasp. A rather poetic arc, don&apos;t you think?
*Say that you are lost: what is this place?*
This is a magical Amulet.
*Ask him what binds him to this demon - the so-called Doctor, Adramahlihk.*
We found a song book in Dallis&apos; stateroom.
*A deep voice rises from within the totem.*
