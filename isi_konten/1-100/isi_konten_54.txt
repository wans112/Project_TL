Just look at you, Red Prince. Standing there in all your silent eloquence.
I should go? I should go. I suppose that I should go...
You waste your time. Speak the password.

*She rolls her eyes before closing them and returning to her nap.*
Good for keeping your skin and scales warm - and portable, to boot. Such convenience!
Oh. Hmm. Let me see if I can work up some grief over the news.
*Ask her what&apos;s on her mind.*
The Red Prince &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;know this. He &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;understand. If not now, then soon.
Dying indeed. We mustn&apos;t forget the House of Shadows continues to hunt us. The Dreamer I met only managed to elude them by escaping bodily into the dream realm, never to return.
Explore the secret passage.
Would be a shame for you to avoid a Voidwoken&apos;s grasp, only for a jittery peasant to strike you down.
You! You there! Prithee, goodly traveller, might I prevail upon you to answer a question?
Lizard
Pitiful life - while our Soul Jars remain,  so do we.
Our gods gave us Spirit Vision with which we may commune with ghosts.
And if you&apos;re talkin&apos; &apos;bout something else... yuck!
Can&apos;t start the game because not all players are ready!
*The spirit shoos you away absently, her gaze fixed intently on the arc that the bouquet is taking through the air...*
*Snarl that if she can sleep tonight, she&apos;s nothing but a psychopath.*
I&apos;m sorry. It&apos;s just - there&apos;s something funny in it, isn&apos;t there? A prisoner one moment, a &lt;i&gt;god &lt;/i&gt;the next. You must feel the difference.
[NOBLE] *Shake your head in disappointment. Is that any way to talk to a member of the royal family?*
*You behold the face of a nightmare. Soul-sickness incarnate, the rotten flesh of the world&apos;s most shameful desires, an all-knowing affliction; the God King&apos;s pallid envoy, walking the world as &lt;i&gt;the Sallow Man.*&lt;/i&gt;
One little silver spoon, that&apos;s all I took from them - a family like that wouldn&apos;t even miss it! I didn&apos;t deserve to die because of it!

*Tell her she ought to be more careful  in the future. You won&apos;t always be around to save her.*

What do you suppose the Magisters were doing with her?
Feel good about yourself now? Siding with bullies on your first day here?
And we&apos;ll make sure the Void and the King stay on the other side.
What a &lt;i&gt;marvellous &lt;/i&gt;creature you&apos;ve found as an ally, Sourcerer. This Malady is far more powerful than I would have assumed...
It may be a dream - but if you die here, you die for real.
*Something catches her eye. Terror swamps her and she slips to the floor, screaming...*
Zerachial the Accursed
It&apos;s beautiful... don&apos;t harm it, keep it safe.
I can&apos;t help thinking that I could have saved them. That I could have done &lt;i&gt;something.&lt;/i&gt;
Why? The same reason we did everything... to protect the realm. What price all of Rivellon against just one portion? Any Divine would do the same... if it meant saving &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
Nice face ya got there - but there&apos;s another I&apos;m waitin&apos; on, so forgive me for not gettin&apos; chatty.
*The words the Advocate uttered echo in your mind. Could it be true that the Deathfog ushered in the rise of the Voidwoken... and whatever gruesome power controls them?*
You must go to her, Red Prince! She is waiting for you!
Well. I was just about to show this Sourcerer here what happens to traitors to the Divine cause. Make yourself comfortable. First-rate entertainment, this is.
*Tell Rhalic he has no right to thrust this burden upon you.*
*Tell him you&apos;ll keep his secret. You&apos;ve no wish to help the Magisters.*

*The spirit cracks an unpleasant smile.*
As soon as she discovered our plot against Braccus, she told her master. And then she laughed as we begged his mercy...
*The chest&apos;s chatter gets louder and angrier. It refuses to open.*
Magister pigs...
Are you sure you want me to do this for you?
Whatever it was, it was too dangerous to be allowed to live.
*Ask the spirit if she knows &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;she wasn&apos;t chosen to become the next Divine.*
We consumed the spirit of the Dreamer.
Be glad, Scion. The Mother Tree is gone. You are free. Saheila says we are all free.
Fine, fine... take the bloody *HIC.* thing. Now off with you - I can feel a Voidwoken of a headache coming along...
*Gesture for her to follow you.*
I know. Or did you think I chose you for those pretty eyes alone?
How awful, I suppose.
You return.
*The child doesn&apos;t lift her head from her knees.*
*You haven&apos;t, but tell her that the dwarves are smuggling Source weapons through Driftwood.*
This you must accept.

I&apos;m sorry, we&apos;re closed. Come back another time.
I was once told there&apos;s an old harbour on the far side of the island. And where there&apos;s a harbour, there may be a boat...
If I meet another, I won&apos;t hesitate to put it out of its misery... lest its misery become mine.

Charming. *Sips.* While you&apos;re here, how about you make yourself useful and settle an argument for us.
*This spirit is as meaningless as any other. Consume her Source.*
No, please - you don&apos;t have to do this. You don&apos;t have to- Argh!
*scrrk*
*Admit that he does have a tendency to carry on a bit.*
Higba&apos;s Hideout
Sad to say, sweetling, I&apos;ve already given my reward to another. Surely you can forgive me, a mother must feed her young after all...
Oh my darling, you&apos;re so very good at what you do! I hope you&apos;re not sore about... what just happened.
*Say that it was your pleasure.*
*Ask what her partners hope to find below.*
In the kitchens of the tavern, of all places. That cook had it. Offered it for a great price, too.
Now, I&apos;m looking for someone. You might even know him. Grey cloak, grey beard, a satchel of books under one arm?
*Zara&apos;s chest? That sounds... interesting? Ask what happened to it.*
*She stands to her full height, her lips pursed in disappointment. She cocks her head and takes you in. The corpses around you seem to close in, ever-so-slightly.*
Whatever we do, we do it inside the mountain. Gods know we worked hard enough to figure out a way in.
Until we meet again, all the best to you.
I do not know you dwarf, but Ros has proven a most... generous partner. His people are welcome here, but... do mind yourself. My tinctures are quite delicate.
And who would&apos;ve thought it? You&apos;re sure not the collared wolf I first met, that&apos;s for sure! You belong to Rivellon now. You and that... demon, I guess.
The role of the Divine, it seems, is to protect the world from the Void.
Since the Deathfog, such a time has come... but someone hunts our Scions. Someone takes them from us, one by one.
*Though he no longer possesses a physical form, your words cause the spirit to visibly &lt;i&gt;reel backwards&lt;/i&gt;, as if struck.*

That all you hear, though? Listen &lt;i&gt;close&lt;/i&gt;.
Sometimes they don&apos;t stay where I put them. That&apos;s okay.
Has thinking time ended, then?
*An Eternal curse escapes from her lips, spoken so forcefully that for a brief moment all light recedes into the webs of darkness.*
*Stare him in the eye and state that you&apos;ve killed his leader, this so-called &apos;Sallow Man&apos;.*
*She hesitates for a moment, then turns away from you.*
[VILLAIN] *Whisper in his ear - tell him his blood is made of oil.*
A story for the ages! Now let&apos;s move. A cell waits with your name on it.
Just a hint, nothing that&apos;d concern a Magister. Made me feel that little bit more confident in meself. Maybe it was all in me head, but I felt like the ring made me more attractive to the women.
*You&apos;ve no time to shoot the breeze with a pup. Take your leave.*
*Remark on his tiff with Malady.*
Do you think I enjoy this work? Taking people away from their families, fitting them with these collars?  I &lt;i&gt;abhor&lt;/i&gt; it, but I bear it.
I bet I could eat a whole you.
*Pfft, they think that&apos;ll stop you? Break the seal and enter the house.*
You feel so... cold. I must have a fever.
I look forward to your match.
These are my last words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I ask that one of my own kind, my own heart, reads them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear One:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consume me and remember.&lt;br&gt;I am not lost here forever.&lt;br&gt;Maybe you leave, and you take me with you.&lt;br&gt;Please.
No, no - I&apos;m sorry, but she&apos;s terribly frightened of lizards. She&apos;s just a child - doesn&apos;t know better just yet. Please - good day!
Ring of the Sky
MY EYES! MY EYES! On account of you being ugly, I mean. Grbbt.
But I understand not! I demand you be the heart!
*Shake your head in disappointment. Ros was right to worry; Justinia&apos;s clearly mad.*
*A certain glow remains around the totem - a glimmer of sentience and watchfulness.*
My findings are very promising... &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt;... speed isn&apos;t a virtue of my field, I&apos;m afraid. It may be some time before I&apos;ll have something to present...
Lizards in the Lord&apos;s house. It&apos;s a disgrace. Diplomacy is a waste of time with the Ancient Empire - they never listen.
[FANE] *Pause for a moment. You&apos;re not sure, but you hope it ends with answers.*
To your very good health, I&apos;m sure! Now then, please allow me to introduce myself:
Barriers lie dormant throughout the Academy.

Regardless, I fear that if you are to see this through, you must walk a darker path. You need to find powerful Sourcerers, no matter how wicked they may seem.
*The sound of the mechanism fills the room... fills your head... fills the world.*
The elves&apos;d be furious if they found out Griff had been torturing one of their own over a little drudanae.
No matter. Surely you cannot best me again! Tell me, &lt;i&gt;Sally Smartypants&lt;/i&gt;: is there such thing as free will?

*Thank Leya. You&apos;re so glad to be rid of that thing.*
I do not take a measly bit of coin for doing you such a big favour!
My fate is sealed, Godwoken. Yours is not.

Stuff you wouldn&apos;t want your &apos;other... your &apos;other... your &apos;arents... FOLKS... to know a&apos;out.
Thanks to you, a new age is soon to dawn.
*Shoot her a puzzled look and ask what she means.*
Now go, and take this ring with you. It was taken from me, but I command this dream. By this ring I make thee one with fire, and one day, by this ring I&apos;ll thee wed.
The ship dances to the tune you sing it. You can always trust the ship. It&apos;s the tune you have to watch.

Here, mister! Alexandar doesn&apos;t have to stay dead, does - HEY! Are you a &lt;i&gt;elf?&lt;/i&gt;
