Stunned status and air damage is ignored.
No... no...
Why are you looking me at that way? It&apos;s terrifying... like you&apos;re hungry.
Sheep Die
Anyway, let&apos;s keep moving. There&apos;s no gains to be had wallowing in the past.
*Tell her you&apos;re ready for whatever comes.*
[IFAN] *Lean in close and whisper: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*You focus your power, calling the Source to your fingertips.*
He killed her. Kemm just cut her down like some Magister...
Here - my special stew, just for my elven kin. Take it, with my compliments.
*Look at him curiously. You&apos;re not sure he understands what&apos;s happening...*
Direct the pointy end towards the problem.
But now that some White Magisters have been found colluding with the Black Ring? Now that Kemm has his excuse? It&apos;s war.
*Tell the rat to back off, you&apos;ve done it no harm.*
A lesson is in order, I think.
I shared Divinity with the arch-demon Adramahlihk. A very different future awaits. If a future there will be...
*He yelps about the Master, Lone Wolves and a man called Griff.*
Go on then. Whatever pennies you&apos;ve got in your pocket ain&apos;t worth my breath. But don&apos;t you go tellin&apos; Griff I was soft on you...
I&apos;m as groggy as a boozy baby. Duna be damned, what the hell&apos;s been happenin&apos;?
*Ask it what it seems to see in you.*
I... I... I was not ready to die. I cannot serve the lord Zorl-Stissa if I&apos;m dead. I pray the temple has not crumbled and Zorl-Stissa&apos;s champion is not dead.
*You struggle to move - and feel your toes wiggle and your fingers twitch. The paralysis is waning.*
*Say only your immediate companions will join you.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Tell him that this is for his own good.*
Really? Well let me read you my favourite part from &lt;i&gt;T Is For Troll. &lt;/i&gt;Ahem. And I quote:
But they sniffed her out eventually, and she spooked. Opened a portal. What d&apos;you expect a person to do when you push &apos;em to the edge? She was just trying to defend herself.
I used to love poetry.
Source Mutator
I regret succumbing to his gilded lies. But I know that you can rise up and rip away his grip on our world. You can still free Rivellon. You can still free &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
We did what we could for Buddy&apos;s friend Emmie.
Painting of a Relic
Summon Poison Totem
Min Damage
Forest - Gorge A
Poison Arrowhead
I fail. A fool, a fool, a fool...
Corpse Explosion Stone Heavy
Holind&apos;s Bow
Oh, and if you meet a woman called Lohse, troublesome little Lohse? Just kill her and be done with it.
*Leap out of the way, shouting for him to stop this madness.*
&lt;i&gt;Why do you come, elf-&lt;/i&gt;seedling?&lt;i&gt; We have a vessel already.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tears fill her eyes as she bites her lip to hold back sobs.*
For. The. Rest. May. She. Have. Mercy. On. Your. Soul.
If I can find the source of this miasma, I should be able to disarm it.
Thank you.
It&apos;ll quench your thirst for being alive.
*A tiny laceworm crawls from between the creature&apos;s stitched lips. It doesn&apos;t seem to notice.*
*He strokes her hair as Leya leans her forehead against his shoulder, muttering quietly about Gareth.*
Wand Of The Lizard
Water Shield
At normal-times, it wouldn&apos;t be just praise yer earnin&apos;, but my key to the rest of yer reward&apos;s been yanked from me pockets! An arena tradition, down th&apos;drain! Still...
Meistr&apos;s Note
*Reach out to comfort her.*
Help them, and I will help you.
Which the hero and which the foe? That surely depends on lullabies heard in the cradle.
My painting... ruined! It was going to be my masterpiece!
Yes, well... best get on. I gather we have a world to save. Or some such thing...
The Gargoyle&apos;s Maze
So. How&apos;d I do, Prince?
[HUMAN] *Inquire about the afterlife. What&apos;s it like?*
That haunted look in its eyes... whatever it was, it&apos;s in terrible pain.
*Growl that you have as much right to be as anyone. If she feels otherwise, then she&apos;d better be ready for a fight.*
A very large-sized potion that enchants and strengthens your magical armour.
Uh-huh. Master Arhu in&apos;t here. But I got m&apos;ball back. Smelly man threw&apos;t off a balcony. Got it back now though, uh-huh.
*Take one last look at him, then turn and walk away.*
Beer Barrel
A pity she&apos;s falling apart.
Bandit Marksman
Magical Poniard
*Suddenly she can&apos;t look you in the eye.*
So. How&apos;d I do, Ifan?
*He barks a laugh, then shakes his head sheepishly.*
*Say that you&apos;re ready to come to a decision.*
Animators Reference: BOW WeaponSet
I wish I could repay you for helping us, but all I&apos;ve got are these glorious, glorious antlers - and those are stuck fast!
I&apos;ve reason to believe one of them may be present on this island, most likely the same chap you&apos;re looking for. Promise me we&apos;ll find him, and I&apos;ll extend you the blessing of my company.
Well... I guess so.
I refuse to be ashamed. If I must choose between Arx and the Ancient Empire for a dose of the mists of death... I choose Arx. Every time.
[RED PRINCE] *Mock her posturing and argue that those with skins as red as hers and yours should stick together.*
Bearwindle
Fishy Business
Who are you to judge me?! Weren&apos;t you &lt;i&gt;willingly &lt;/i&gt;trying to help those leeches, those so-called &apos;gods&apos;...? Their lust for power is the root of all misery in this world!
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Magister Ranley, Caulker&apos;s Mate -
Oh my. Someone in need of a lick and cuddle?
*Ask what he thinks about what you witnessed in the Hall of Echoes.*
Alright darling. I&apos;ll dance.
Flicking through the book you see page after page describing how to enchant grenades with a Source orb, making them incredibly powerful. One example is fully illustrated, diagrams and all, and apparently the most dangerous one: how to curse a cluster grenade with a Source orb.
Adventures
*Your stomach freezes inside you; cold dread spreads to your fingers and toes. &lt;i&gt;It&apos;s back.*&lt;/i&gt;
Now go.
I&apos;m not even a real person, you know. I&apos;ve got this thing in me, and my chance of getting better is getting smaller all the time.
I&apos;ll need more roses soon enough. I already started with the last traveller who interrupted me. Come; let&apos;s make next year&apos;s harvest a real &lt;i&gt;bounty&lt;/i&gt;.
A Scion&apos;s power destroyed the Mother Tree.
The demon&apos;s guise, or vessel - one can&apos;t be quite certain - is that of a lizard known only as &apos;the Advocate&apos;.
*Ask what the hell his problem is.*
*Laugh and say that you haven&apos;t had the pleasure, but you&apos;ll let them know if you find him.*
&lt;i&gt;There, you see? Let go - welcome home.&lt;/i&gt;
Are you sure you want to quit the game?
Summon Oily Blob Scroll
Demira of the Four Sisters
*The dagger feels so damn good in your hand. Slide it in deeper and drag it across.*
Rusted and salt-encrusted, this key smells like it&apos;s been marinating in some none-too-fresh tidepool for a few centuries or so.
We are in ritual for our comrade Sarias, dead at the hand of a Lone Wolf.
*Ask her what answers she&apos;s hunting for.*
Want a drink?
Besides, I am thoroughly intrigued by your... uniqueness. Undead &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Godwoken. Such an unlikely turn of events!
Oh, but it&apos;s my very business to know things, redscale.
*Urge him to make his point: if you&apos;re to accept the role of rat catcher, you&apos;ll need more concrete information.*
Adramahlihk... His name is not enough... He knew I was coming for him... A trap, a cage...
Your flesh has such &lt;i&gt;perfume&lt;/i&gt;... I am drunk on you.
*Tell Beast you&apos;re a firm believer in finders, keepers. Looks like it&apos;s not his hat anymore!*
Recover Garvan&apos;s supplies.
*Tell him you&apos;ve met Hannag. She is safe.*
Unknown
Affection: +1
*The shaman searches your eyes for a sign that you might be lying.*
So be it. But remember - &lt;i&gt;I see you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell Gawin you have the teleporter.*
I cannot believe how far Arx has fallen.
*Say you&apos;ll tell her once she answers a few questions of yours.*
You&apos;re MEAN! And you KNOW it!
*Bid him goodnight.*
*Ask him what has happened between the Paladins and the Magisters.*
There&apos;s likely more to this story. Folks don&apos;t often go so far over the edge without cause.
[Translate79_f1c159d9-84c2-4625-ba6f-4efc8ff7b969]
She was a soldier following orders. Just like me. Let her live with the torment of her actions... just as I have to.
Trap Disarming Kits work on mines and gas pits, too.
|Can only be cast by Sourcerers|&lt;br&gt;
Sourcerers. They- they brought in Sourcerers?
*Tell the dog he&apos;s really bad at maths.*
Swornbreaker Schematic
*Let it slide. You don&apos;t want to get into a fight right now.*
[LOHSE] *Remark that if you keep something bottled up inside you, it might break out at an inopportune moment... better to get things out in the open.*
White Magister Kari&apos;s got that Sourcerer on the ropes up there. Would be better if it were that Hannag woman, but I&apos;m not complainin&apos;. Not too much anyway.
Wasn&apos;t that Prudence? Barkeep at the Black Bull in Driftwood? Mother of Kniles? Oh well. She&apos;s in a better place now. And her sacrifice served a very good cause. You could almost call it... redemption. If you like that sort of thing.
Bye-bye, mister lizard.
*Hiss* The elf has many visitors, all manner of ape, but Xiuh never thought &lt;i&gt;kin &lt;/i&gt;would come here.
Pincers
A fine match. A very fine match.
*Start with the waiter. He&apos;s serving these two horses at their table. They&apos;re racehorses, and they&apos;re talking between themselves about the race they ran that day.*
Don&apos;t I know they&apos;re a jumpy lot these days. Voidwoken have got all of us sleepin&apos; with our weapons in-hand. Can&apos;t fault &apos;em for wanting to protect us.
*Wave a hand in front of his eyes.*
But you&apos;re outside the walls, Sourcerer - that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; business.
Down fer a little scufflin&apos; and tusslin&apos;? Let&apos;s see if you got some fight in ya.
The egg is ready. Douse it in fire, and birth a dragon!
City Guard Cardinal
Supposed that&apos;ll teach me to be greedy, eh?
[RED PRINCE] *Bow slightly and tell her you&apos;re known as the Red Prince.*
And if you want to be &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; Master... you must first &lt;i&gt;become &lt;/i&gt;the Master. You are what you eat.
Worse than war rations, these.
Please, no! I&apos;ll show myself worthy!
Magisters. What are they up to?
Can&apos;t blame you for trying, Voidbringer. So let&apos;s put an end to this, shall we? It&apos;s not like this little discussion was getting us anywhere.
Now that the Eternals are back, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a place left for the mortal races. Their history may as well have never happened.
*Tell him you won&apos;t talk to whatever lies beyond the gate. Quick kill. In and out. Promise.*
*Tell him you&apos;re quite aware; you&apos;ve had a run-in or two with that demon of hers.*
*Scoff. It seems the mighty Kemm has been bested by a superior warrior!*
Restores [1] each turn.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. The caverns under the Blackpits remain shrouded in mystery.
The half-elf Malady shows great interest in whether or not we are Godwoken. She&apos;ll help us escape the island.
We&apos;ll talk over a good bottle of wine later, but let&apos;s locate an escape route first!
*The bull lazily chews non-existent cud. It registers your presence.*
Spellcaster&apos;s Fingers
Item Generator
I sense doom. Decay. &lt;i&gt;Void. &lt;/i&gt;I&apos;ve had a change of heart. Release the fog into Arx.
*She gives you a quick hug.*
The rebellious Beast seeks the village of Driftwood and the dwarf Lohar. We may travel together awhile.
These are lizard remains... but in the human section of the graveyard? Something&apos;s amiss...
*Tell him you&apos;re sworn to no god.*
*Intervene. You don&apos;t need anyone feeding Beast&apos;s overinflated ego.*
&lt;i&gt;*Hurt her.*&lt;/i&gt;
