We have ventured onwards, without finding Queen Justinia.
I gave up my Source to heal the veil and banish the Void forever.
Deal with the Lich.
*Insist that you bought everything you&apos;re carrying with your own hard-earned money.*
*Bargain with her. You&apos;d happily give her someone else&apos;s flesh to spare your own.*
Guards! Guards!
Confiscated Ancient Empire Air Staff
Greetings again. Is there nothing more important for you to do than disturb my rest?
My my, that was stirring! Quite an august display of violence, Godwoken.
Aww, neat! I wish I could do that!
Well, I look forward to beating the shite out of you then. Bye now, til later...
*Be on your way. He&apos;ll figure things out one way or another.*
*Have your ultimate vengeance: consume the Master&apos;s Source.*
DeSelby paid for her crimes. As far as I&apos;m concerned, she&apos;s a Paladin once more.
An unexpected error has occurred.&lt;br&gt;Cross-saves will be disabled.
You&apos;re in big trouble if you don&apos;t get out of here.
Magical Pinewood Bow
Normally you&apos;d be right, but I&apos;m afraid that horse, as it were, has bolted. At least for today.
Ironbar Bessie
*In the space beyond the altar, the pipework... &lt;i&gt;shifts.*&lt;/i&gt;
We blessed one of the pigs, and it fled into the wilderness. Perhaps we&apos;ll meet it again.
With a face-ripper. And a suitable sacrifice, of course.
As do these lands. Fear is a persuasive pheromone.
Hat of the Sage
Tomb Close
Me too. Me too.
*Arch your brow at his pipe and note that it&apos;s not the healthiest of habits...*
Hyperopia
Fortify
*Whisper that Malady said she could train you. Is that true?*
*...but the twisted remains of what was once an elf.*
[BARBARIAN] *Shout them down. You are here for the Aeteran - not for conversation.*
*Say that you&apos;re still looking into the matter.*
*Say you want to talk to her about... well, the two of you.*
I admit, I tried this once and found it lacking. But perhaps another attempt is warranted. In the name of experimentation, of course...
*The craftmistress is trying to look through you, as if you weren&apos;t there at all.*
*Say: &apos;Third.&apos;*
*Narrow your eyes. Tell him the scar on your face is as lucky as it gets. Then smile. And sashay away.*
Oh no, but I seem to have misplaced it. I&apos;m sorry, poppet. But this little limb is much appreciated.
*His eyes still blaze, a piercing silver. A triumphant smile dominates his face, as he bows extravagantly before you.*
If I want to see the dead I have but to look at my arm. I&apos;ve no need of magic tricks.
Foul deed. The work of a monster.
My heart goes out to that poor creature, but I&apos;d choose their suffering over a demon running loose any day.
The Armoury
Who said anything about &apos;otherworldly&apos;? Demons and brain-ghosts are just as mundane as you or I! Mostly you. So...? Wanna go together?
House Exterior - Estate B
Hervett dies in Arx, as he wishes. But now I am alone, in this awful stone forest.
The Sssallow Man is here, and there, and everywhere. But mossst of all, the Sssallow Man is nowhere. Nowhere at all. Unlesss... there is a cave, I hear. Perhapsss he&apos;s there.
Me? Sure. You seem to be in one piece, too.
No. We kneel no more. The armour - the &lt;i&gt;spores&lt;/i&gt; - show me our future.
Old Cap
They will not accept me. No, the most I can hope for is grace. And I have that, by Amadia&apos;s word.
... What? No! You don&apos;t even have a stomach. It&apos;d just be indulgent.
Well hello there. I wasn&apos;t expecting you. Which means you haven&apos;t paid. See the man downstairs.
This place is already overrun with addicts and orphans, and now I&apos;ve got to deal with... what? A wayward pilgrim?
*She gives no indication at all that she has heard you, save for a single tear dripping from one eye.*
Dead Butler
I proclaim thee the Champion of the Driftwood arena! Get yer gloat on, &apos;n&apos; take a swig of ale. Hell, take a dozen. We&apos;ll be singin&apos; for years to come of the great elven Void-slayer!
*You see Daeyena, the runaway Scion from Fort Joy. She looks up, and recognition turns to fury as she spots the armour you wear.*
Kniles the Flenser
Advanced Selection: Cycling
...however long that is.
Sparkstriker
You are about to leave for a higher level area. If you have unfinished business in Arx, you should take care of it before venturing forth. Are you ready to leave?
Lizard Citizen
[IFAN] *Mutter a rote prayer to the Seven; what harm could it do.*
Gods&apos; truth...
Human Worshipper
Heh. Traitors get what comes to &apos;em. Same as Sourcerers oversteppin&apos; their bounds. You&apos;ll make a fine feed for my hounds, though.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;It is you - the prey that my master seeks... Godwoken...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him that seems steep.*
I wanted to save them all. I failed.
Well that was decidedly unpleasant.
The. First. Godwoken. To. Enter. The. Wellspring. Of Ascension. Becomes. Divine.
But of course. The Path of Blood awaits - it will decide if you are worthy.
*She shakes with anger, her eyes flashing daggers at you. Were she alive, now might be just about the right time to run far, far away.*
Figured I knew ya - one of Lohar&apos;s, eh? You&apos;re late. But... guess that&apos;s a good thing. I&apos;ll unlock the door for ya...
*Take your leave.*
With their new dwarven Divine, the dwarves led the Alliance in the war on the God King.
Boat
I see the deceit in your eyes. You&apos;re no lizard, and a liar!
You do know that time is of the essence here, don&apos;t you?
Oh for the love of the Void...
There is nothing sacred here - there never was. &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt; showed me.
Thank you.
*The lizard flinches when she sees you, then slumps. Crestfallen, she cranes her neck to look behind you, seemingly looking for someone.*
Who are you and who sent you?
You&apos;d put your own skin before the lives of everyone around you?
*Wake him up.*
You speak loudly, young Godwoken, but I see only a barking dog.
Lohar&apos;s emissary to the wedding in Arx met with a Voidwoken accident.
*The creature turns away from him and, panting, turns to you.*
But... I suppose... well, there&apos;s no harm, is there? You seem to be a good sort. One of Lucian&apos;s own, isn&apos;t that right?
Jawbone the Merchant
Hematite
Perhaps. But what is a pilgrimage after all, if not a journey of atonement in search of enlightenment?
Maximum Range: [1]m&lt;br&gt;
*Smile and say she owes you nothing.*
*Tell it it&apos;s a good dog.*
*Remark that Magister Bellworth mightn&apos;t have died had he not sent her to confront the cook alone.*
You wanted riches. How... &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt;. But I&apos;m true to my word. Gold, the cost of a spider&apos;s kiss.
*Finish the song for him. &apos;Smoke gets in your hair, your skin peels from your bones, you fade to black...&apos;*
I&apos;ve read such stories myself. Some ancient texts even include sketches, but I always presumed them to be myths. I was clearly wrong.
Well then my humble home will seem comfortable by comparison! Please, stay as long as you wish.
*Ask whether he thinks it&apos;s good that the Great Acorn may return.*
The Nameless Isle has been destroyed, and Dallis has used the Aeteran to steal the powers that resided in the Wellspring. At least the hunt for Godwoken such as us will likely cease now - if we cannot ascend, we pose little threat.
Water won&apos;t warp me, nor fire scorch me. Neither cyclone nor blizzard scratch my shell.
Don&apos;t blame you. Enough bad blood on this ship already.
The author of this book highlights the perils of monarchy and suggests citizens themselves ought to wield power.
They disembarked in the night when we first arrived. When the monster attacked they were long gone.
You think this is a game? Well, good luck escaping without me, you sodding ringworm!
The fish is indeed malignant! All the species of Rivellon are affected by it in the same manner!
&apos;Arx Fletchery: Bows, Bolts &amp; Death from Above.&apos;
&apos;ullo missus.
If you can tell the &lt;i&gt;Godwoken &lt;/i&gt;no more, your tongue is of no use. Cut it out.
I did nothing! Or... I didn&apos;t do what they accused me of, at least... a miscarriage of justice is what this is...
*Conjure a precious memory and hold on to it.*
Player [1] doesn&apos;t have online permissions. Splitscreen with this player will be disabled while multiplayer session.
&lt;i&gt;I said let&apos;s go.&lt;/i&gt;
STR
*She leans in, her bloody tongue flickering hungrily about your face.*
What is it, boy?
Well, you certainly &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; the same. But there&apos;s something in the air around you. It vibrates ever-so-slightly. There&apos;s magic in it. Power.
I own you. I have tasted your flesh.
*The cub looks sadder than anything you&apos;ve ever seen.*
Delay Turn
I have told you before the Void is stronger than ever. But so are you, my child.
Miller
You should know that I have forgiven you your little indiscretion with the irritating Jahan. But you owe me. At least hear me out. We should work together. We share common cause.
Are they stolen? Darling... &lt;i&gt;what power isn&apos;t?&lt;/i&gt;
*The petrified body is both hard and brittle, as if it might shatter were it to topple over.*
&apos;Here resteth Edmund Vanarlic.&lt;br&gt;Gallant soldier. Nearly a hero.&apos;
*A vision appears. It wavers, then becomes clear. In the reddish light cast by flowing lava, you see a cave. The roof has fallen in. A figure lies trapped beneath the fallen rock - alive, but in terrible pain.*
Yet the enemies of the Devourer are many. When I spoke the truth, we were forced into hiding, awaiting his rebirth.
You have seen him? Tell me - where was he?
Well, my jaws *could* use the exercise...
An attack on our consulate should not go unavenged, my lord! Surely you will see justice done.
I could have sworn I was talking to my mother a moment ago.
He wasn&apos;t satisfied with our fealty, he wanted total control. His madness for power knew no limits.
Those filthy beasts were like rats. A swarm most vile, but vanquished - as a matter of course.
I do hope I&apos;ve not been overestimating your intelligence. Anathema&apos;s blade. By the weapon&apos;s own admission, it&apos;s to be found somewhere on Bloodmoon Island.
succeeded!
*Tell her to &lt;i&gt;breathe&lt;/i&gt;... if she tells you what she remembers, you can help her.*
*Load the forge.*
If my mother were here, she&apos;d box my ears for not being able to thank you properly. Though I reckon that wolloping from the Reds was punishment enough. Take this, at least. It&apos;ll have to do.
*Stand back and let him rise.*
Persuasion Success!
*She looks at you in surprise when you bare an arm of bone.*
*Shake your head and tell him you could never tire of his stories.*
&lt;b&gt;We killed them with her little hands. We made her watch. We made her feel.&lt;/b&gt;
All of my thanks are yours and yours alone. Farewell, my friend.
*Gasp* Someone, over here!
Leave me be now, pet. I&apos;ve plans to make.
*Confront him about the invitation he sent to Arhu.*
The Red Prince was waylaid by a paid assassin! Sent by the House of Shadows, no doubt.
You &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;protect us. I know it.
The Heart of Contamination blossoms with a complete set, boosting the armour&apos;s level to 19. Toxic sap flows through the wearer&apos;s blood, lashing out at attackers.
*Tell her that you&apos;re no thief.*
You come too late. We are complete. One skin - and we only &lt;i&gt;begin.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask if he&apos;s made any progress looking into the missing Magisters.*
How about you? You missing home by now?
And you, Shield?
*The Magister&apos;s face turns white. He makes a move to step backwards, then stops himself as his hand closes on the weapon at his hip.*
