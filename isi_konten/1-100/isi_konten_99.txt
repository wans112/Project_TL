REPORT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To: Fort Joy&lt;br&gt;From: The front&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last batch of Sourcerers were practically catatonic; they could barely be compelled to move at all. We took to leading them around on leads, like dogs.&lt;br&gt;Certainly Dallis will know what to do to compel compliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’ll need far more battalions than we’ve received if we’re to stand a chance. The lizards are organised and effective.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
*A statue of a trumpet-playing dwarf. But something about it smells... off.*
He left us to die, then turned on our pupils. Why would he sabotage the path of his successors? It&apos;s not for me to understand the actions of the Divine, no matter how &lt;i&gt;murderous &lt;/i&gt;they are.
A seemingly peaceful scene, you can&apos;t help but notice the shadows drawing in upon the hapless figure on the shore of the lake.
*Smile and say that the days of &apos;less than a king&apos; draw to an end.*
*Grab her by the wrist.*
*Ask if he thinks Isbeil might be this spy.*
Find somewhere that offers intelligence brews, then add this monkfish sample. The effects could be most interesting...
Have a look yourself, sir! I think the traitor is still there. In a somewhat... changed condition.
Can&apos;t say I&apos;m not sorry to see you go, but you&apos;ll be alright. You seem to have the hang of this place.
*Ask what you must do.*
I miss Joe&apos;s mum.
Makeshift Club
*Tell him you just couldn&apos;t bring yourself to end a life like that.*
Fish Bone
*You are lost in memory, treading upon the Isle of Mist&apos;s wispy sand once more. You sense something amid the fog... and &lt;i&gt;it is behind you! &lt;/i&gt;- but you whip your head backwards to see only grey.*
The Spirit of a Peasant Woman
We found the location of an ancient altar after reading Mordus&apos; logs.
No, if they return, they will reclaim &apos;their&apos; Source. The Source that was used to create you.
Saheila was killed, as per Magister Borris&apos; orders.
Don&apos;t want to intrude, seein&apos; as how you got your own trials and travails, but don&apos;t s&apos;pose you been to Reaper&apos;s Coast of late? Maybe heard of a fella named... oh, what was it... Lohar?
Alien Life Essence
Lone Wolf&apos;s Cache
*Index fingers pressed to her lips, she pauses a moment to give you a scrutinising gander.*
&apos;Here lies Ermin Kringus, faithful overseer.&apos;
*Ask about the names on her left arm.*
You again? I have urgent royal matters to attend to - begone from here, at once!
The Tactical Archer&apos;s Guide To Arrows
Selector Move Left
Yes indeed! I harbour some hope that she may still bless me. Make me a little less piggy, a little more wizardly, you know?
*Put a hand on his shoulder and tell him not to give up hope. He&apos;ll find her back.*
Most of the time &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/font&gt; to locked doors and chests are &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/font&gt;. Look around to see if you can &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;find&lt;/font&gt; the key to this door.
I have a way out of here. It won&apos;t be easy, and I need a partner. Just one.
But I see my dearest Featherfall now has his claws in &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. I am glad you will take him from here. For my flesh lives on in him now and my blood will know what it is to fly.
Just as I thought. You die here and now, Sourcerer!
&lt;i&gt;I know what I saw!&lt;/i&gt;
What? No. No, you can&apos;t! I am to be reborn. I am his favourite!
Oh - you mean it? That is a cryin&apos; shame to hear. With all she could do, all she could&apos;ve taught the younger generation... What a waste.
Kickstarter
*Tell her you can talk it all over later, but that you&apos;re going to brutally murder this man first.*
*Remark that you don&apos;t care about any &apos;trial&apos;, and take your leave.*
Oh no - you shan&apos;t leave. The guards are not about to learn where I live...
*Say you&apos;d like to trade.*
It was powerful - &lt;i&gt;too &lt;/i&gt;powerful, so we sealed it and the poor elf it inhabited in our deepest vaults... sometimes incarceration was the best we could muster, in such dire cases.
Amadia&apos;s Fire Ward
Electric Demon
It&apos;s... it&apos;s like lava flowing through me. I can&apos;t contain it for long...
*Hand over the tablet and Swornbreaker parts to Almira.*
*He looks to the suspicious bulbs surrounding the chest. Then back to you. He knows he&apos;s caught out... his lip quivers again... wobbles... then he starts crying once more.*
*Shake your head. You haven&apos;t.*
Wits
How much do you want? I have fewer Paladins to pay so I do have ready gold - but there are limits.
You&apos;re free to do as you please. Though I don&apos;t expect you&apos;ll make many friends in Arx with that attitude...
No, you sweet fool, you couldn&apos;t.
Yeah? How so?
Eleanessa told us her arch-demon&apos;s name: Adramahlihk. He possessed the doctor and left. We must kill him.
Mari needs help.
*She cocks a black eye up at you and winks.*
I watch the gate. You must leave.
Halla&apos;s Shiny Ribbon
Happy are those who feast on the fallen...
*Sigh* I certainly appreciate your strength in arms - and a brow-ridge that one can balance one&apos;s goblet on is nothing to be sneezed at.
Whatever needs doing. Isn&apos;t that obvious?
*Ask what&apos;s in it for you.*
Ribbit. &lt;i&gt;R-r-r-ribbit&lt;/i&gt;.
You... you saved me! I felt a... a &lt;i&gt;bright, clean goodness&lt;/i&gt; when you held me, and the monster got scared!
*Tarquin shakes himself out of his brief reverie and moves his eyes to you.*
*Ask her what she makes of the gods&apos; current situation. They seem to be in quite some trouble.*
*The curve of the shell nestles in your palm. The heart inside beats double time with yours. The dragonchild is almost ready to be born.*
Captain&apos;s Compass
*The altar sits before you, leaves rustling quietly in the breeze. A crescent moon has been carved into its wood.*
Let&apos;s finish this.
On the other hand, if you have anything useful to tell me...
Total Weight Of Stolen Items
Umbral Link
Not in the least. All of my threats are delivered tied to the end of a poison-tipped arrow. It saves time in the long run.
The door&apos;s open. Go on through.
*Brush him off. You&apos;re not doing that.*
Spirit of a Possessed Rogue
Because the God King is our &lt;i&gt;true lord and saviour &lt;/i&gt;- he&apos;s going to right the wrongs of the Seven. Not that I&apos;d expect some bloody thrall to understand...
*The painter scoffs. He looks quite pale, you notice. Ill, perhaps. A drip of red falls from his sleeve to the cobbles.*
Arhu the wizard spent more and more time as a cat.
*Implore them to stop. You&apos;ve heard enough lies.*
*Say it all.*
The same reason my father and I did everything... to protect the realm. As that is what the Divine is &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;.
Seriously, check it out, this stuff is really rather good...
*He talks about Magister Viktar with familiarity. Did they know each other?*
*The kid pats her pockets, looking for signs of a pickpocketing, then stops and wags her finger at you.*
The thief is unworthy soil from which to grow - but it hurts her, and that is enough.
An audience is granted; I am yet too intrigued to give my leave. Now tell me, Isbeil: Why do you allow this man before me?
I relish the scenery. And the lack of company.
Essentially it means that my peoples&apos; memories will become my memories. All of them.
Royal Protector
Seems like all my life is about Masters...
Many a great noble perished in that sudden hell. As for myself, I&apos;m glad I lived to tell the tale, just like the Red Princess bid me to.
[JESTER] *Loudly wonder why they&apos;d bother; a tongue can&apos;t be harder to grow back than a tail.*
Return Harrick&apos;s ring to Magister Carver.
You&apos;re... uh... somewhat more &lt;i&gt;steady&lt;/i&gt; than I was led to believe.
I&apos;m well aware of the Beast&apos;s ambitions, Your Highness.
Bad luck to let the dead linger aboard. Soon as we get moving, we ought to clear the deck.
What have you done?! You monster, I shared my wisdom with you, and you consume one of my colleagues? May the Void take you!
*Mention Gill and Lohar.*
You are just like the Magisters - always trying to take what is not yours.
&lt;br&gt;From [1]: [2][3]
Hmm. Normally I&apos;d argue with you, but you do have a certain... &lt;i&gt;look &lt;/i&gt;about you. Very well. But if I am to write a first-rate work, You must face some... difficult questions. Are you prepared to answer?
Squirel Talk
*Ask what she makes of Jahan.*
Cursed Poison Cloud
Traitorous Guardian
Shut it, fork-tongue.
Speak up, servant! Do you bring word from Braccus or not?&lt;br&gt;
What word on getting this oil contraption working again? We need more barrels to bring down this blasted wall!
No sense in hanging around here, Lohse. You&apos;ve got &lt;i&gt;Divinity &lt;/i&gt;to find.
Sharing Heal
...but never heartless. I don&apos;t know what her endgame is. But I don&apos;t want to be anywhere near when it begins.
Workin&apos; for the D.O., I bet
You can end all this.
Get lute, play lute, get loot, get glad.
Listen here, whoever you are. We don&apos;t have much to give you. No, we don&apos;t have much... but we do have &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;.
Demonic Tutelage
Sticky
Much obliged! Can I trouble you for just one more? Penny for a dead dog and all that?
You- you threw them to the Void?
I&apos;m more than a sum of my parts, friend, indeed... but I fear you might have come to the wrong calculation about me. How about you just let this matter rest?
Mend Metal Skillbook
[BEAST] *Sing an old sea shanty called &apos;Rolling Rum&apos; that brought you through many a long and stormy night.*
*Nod in understanding. It was a pleasure while it lasted.*
Magister Frowse
*Say that if he&apos;s so certain that Higba isn&apos;t the culprit, he should inform the investigating Magisters.*
We consumed the spirit of the Chronicler.
*The pain makes itself known again, swamping your senses. A pale, mis-shapen figure looms ahead of you, a glowing tip of red-hot iron in its hand.*
*She sighs, then begins to hum.*
Penny Bun Mushroom
*His lip curls over his blackened teeth and with his smile you know you&apos;ve lost the argument. He turns back towards the sea captain, ringing the bell with renewed urgency.*
When Lucian died, we waited. Yet Alexandar never rose to Divinity. And then we started to find more like him. More Godwoken. And we weren&apos;t the only ones looking. A killer had marked them, too.
Bonus Attribute Points
Corpse Explosion Fire
*Marg sniffs and folds his arms, looking away.*
*You are talking through a hole in a wall to someone on the other side.*
Dwarven technology was key in the battle against the God King.
Fran, girl. Yeh need to get right up on my head, yeh do!
[UNDEAD] *Close your eyes and hum to her. You&apos;re not sure how you know this song - but the melody is comforting.*
Best of luck, ben-Mezd.
With that thing inside her, no-one is safe at her side.
*Ask him where you can find these Seekers.*
The archivist&apos;s journal described the elf Eleanessa, the Ancestor Tree, and how she was possessed by a demon and died.
*Bid Ifan farewell.*
&apos;course it is.
*He snorts...*
*Punch him in what passes for his face.*
*Tears rise at the corners of her eyes, and she turns away.*
Farewell.
You think I&apos;d take a measly bit of coin for doing you such a big favour?
*Jahan&apos;s words barely reach your ears; you are focused on Lohse, your companion, your friend - she looks nothing like herself, but you don&apos;t know how to help her.*
*How can he protect the Godwoken? Say that the island is overrun with Black Ring!*
*Ask the Voidwoken why it calls you thief.*
