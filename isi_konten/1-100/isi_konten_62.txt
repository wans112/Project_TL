*Ask if you might take a crack at turning the wheel.*
We are Arx. You have a place here.
Ancient Statue of Braccus Rex
I wish he&apos;d stawwwwp. Or at least slow dowwwwn...
Even the demons were afraid.
*Who dares...? You lock eyes with the vile-looking lizard that interrupted her before, his face the very definition of mischief.*
A Sourcerer? Hah! Second-rat wizards, by my book. That lizard there&apos;s a Sourcerer, and look at her now! Strung up by her hands, with a death rattle hanging &apos;round her lips.
Bamboo
*As the torches around you flicker and crack to life, you hear a low groan. It starts soft, then crescendos until your chest rattles and your head buzzes.*
*Say her family sounds lovely and thank her for sharing.*
Replica of an Ancient Empire Warship
*Conjure the sound of Alexandar laughing, then send the Sallow Man to his maker.*
*As you approach the woman Fane gasps. You turn and see that he&apos;s fixated on her.*
*Say you can&apos;t be certain. No single entity seems to have the advantage.*
*Offer your empathy. Surely the Sourcerer meant no harm.*
I like my men the way I like my cheese: MATURE.
You wouldn&apos;t remember me, sir, but you saved my life at Tamber Brook. I still have the hanky where you stuck my big toe.
Explode all corpses around you, dealing physical damage in the area.
*Roll your eyes and say it&apos;s not because he&apos;s a prince you also believe his fairytales.*
Better get you to prison, then!
Atusa! A noble soul. Brave. Trying to help me. Trying to help many of us. But I was... they thought I could... maybe I could have...
*Bid them farewell.*
Search for a Phase Capacitor.
Hmm. Can&apos;t find what I&apos;m looking for, but it still looks like you&apos;ve been getting into trouble. You need to cool off in prison, yeah?
Would you really trust someone else with that much power? Think of the people you&apos;ve met so far. All those Magisters who&apos;d see your turned into one of those ghastly Monks. Alexandar. Dallis.
Isn&apos;t it magical to &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; love?
[UNDEAD] *Remark that it&apos;s curious how he can recognise you as undead on sight - despite your mask - yet he claims to know nothing of necromancy...*
*Show your surprise. He&apos;s very calm about being dead.*
Fleetfooted
*Wonder what exactly Dallis told him.*
*Ask who you&apos;re talking to.*
*Tell her to relax; you&apos;re with Lohar.*
Guards! There&apos;s a prisoner roaming loose in here - and a bloody serpent at that!
Isbeil! Show yourself!
Divinity is not an end - it&apos;s a means. A means to help, or to hinder. And I&apos;ve seen within you. I see what you intend. And I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; stop you.
*Weathered and rugged, the man sleeps soundly. He mumbles in his slumber.*
Perform the Godwoken ritual.
*Ask to know what the favour is before agreeing to it.*
Scorching Heat
Firewater said Edie&apos;s name.
*Kneeling before the altar is the spirit of another orc - a priest. He produces an ornate dagger and slices open the palm of his hand. Around him, the sound of rushing water grows.*
You think I would trade a Godwoken soul for another? Do you think me innocent as the elves? Do you think me gullible as your companions?
Oh, that&apos;s&lt;i&gt; it&lt;/i&gt;.
Patience. You must prove yourself worthy of such answers.
*Say you&apos;re happy he survived the shipwreck you were in.*
Come to join the clean-up crew, have you? Heh!
An assassination attempt! How novel! Someone wants me dead. But who? The House of Law, perhaps? They can&apos;t be trusted.
Applies Necrofire.
Make Roll
It looks so... unhappy. I wish there was something I could do.
I relinquished my claim on Divinity in favour of another. May the new Divine do right by my people - and all of Rivellon.
*Step away.*
Well hello! What brings you by today?
*A faint breath of chill air brushes the back of your neck. The gentle scrape of a sound... a foot - or a hoof - dragging across a floorboard perhaps.*
*The thick air of battle wafts outwards from your kin&apos;s mind; the echoing war cries, the stench of the dead, the ringing of steel... and the faint scent of spices from your home.*
It&apos;s almost like I could just... step off the edge of this ledge and float away. There&apos;s nothing to me anymore. Nothing at all.
*Say that&apos;s to be expected. He is the new Divine. A lot rests on his shoulders.*
Of course they are: as good bodyguards should be.
*Peer down at the river. The current seems calm. Tell him you&apos;ll do your best.*
Go on.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Luck to you.
Arhu must have left a clue. He MUST.
Pretty good, ain&apos;t he? Bet he&apos;d even write a poem for ya, if ya sidled up all nice-like.
*Ask who you are speaking to.*
And I &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;care what you think about anything at all.
I... I don&apos;t want to hurt anybody... *whine*
Lucky for me, she caught an old wound. Scar slowed down the knife.
Wabbit.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
*Ask what happened to his face.*
*Before you, a statue reaches her arms blindly for the sun-drenched skies. The shadows of the pillars around her dance and weave, wreathing her in their dark embrace.*
*Muse that if its mother was here she&apos;d probably be trying to kill you right now.*
Wait. He didn&apos;t leave a thing to his daughter. He bequeathed his entire estate... to his pig?
*Thank him. The fear that binds him to Rivellon has lifted. He may enter the Hall of Echoes.*
Fear-piercer
Yes, let&apos;s. And let us also forget about this entire bug-ridden debacle!
Words. Just words with you. Think what you want of me. I sure as hell don&apos;t need your blessing.
A most excellent decision! Alas, I fear in my excitement I over spoke and potentially promised more than my meagre means are able to provide.
I can&apos;t offer you more. May the memory of our kiss remain... sacred.
My efforts continue. I must admit it&apos;s quite an &lt;i&gt;intricate &lt;/i&gt;piece to work with, even for someone like myself. I remain confident of success though.
Windego, the murderous witch from the Merryweather, is alive. She has lost her master&apos;s favour. We may yet have business with her.
Curse the gods twice. What are you doin&apos; to the man?
Get &lt;i&gt;off!&lt;/i&gt;
Healing Potion
I offer you my sincerest congratulations: as of now, you are my slave!
*Observe that drinking is a lot easier when you still have skin and bones.*
*The man before you shakes and twitches. His eyes dart nervously from your hands to your feet and back again.*
Level [1]: +[2]% Dodging and +[3]% to all resistances.
I suspect these skulls were left here as a warning.
Fort Joy Magic Mirror
*Tell her you&apos;ll miss her company.*
Apprentice&apos;s House
Iron Greaves
Human graves. Their burial rituals are so... mundane.
[OUTLAW] *Spread your arms in welcome. Maybe you&apos;ll have the opportunity to take your money back.*
Oh it&apos;s quite simple, one just acquires a face, a Source orb, and combines the two to make a face mask.
*Take your leave.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you&apos;ve seen it before. Getting posted in a backwater like this makes soldiers&apos; feet itch.*
A girl&apos;s wedding should be the happiest day of her life... mine ended up being my funeral.
Demonfury
But you did. And now the tables have turned. You look quite startled to me.
Mind Maggot Grenade
*You&apos;ll not let the one that scarred you go easy into the night. Gut him: finish what you started.*
Circle of Protection
Black Ring Diary
If you can salvage anything from our luggage, please help yourself. We need to hurry back to the city - we don&apos;t have time to dredge it out of the water.
[VILLAIN] *Smirk and list all the innocents you&apos;ve slaughtered.*
But they &lt;i&gt;take my spores. &lt;/i&gt;I warn that they are volatile. The Magisters do not listen.
You&apos;ve seen my true self. There&apos;s nothing more to know.
Brahmos&apos; Rendezvous
Halt, thief!
Strange creatures invited us to see their master on Bloodmoon Island. They may have been possessed.
I offered the perfection of the blade and you seek the perfection of the blade. How fortuitous.
Ta ta, lobster.
Arrow recovered
The Seekers...
Express your interest someplace else - I&apos;m busy.
And I suppose you think that&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; thing.
*What shall you do with Divinity?*
*Sigh* But Mother, I&apos;m sleeping!
*Put up your hands and slowly back away.*
Let me offer you a bite to eat. Call it a peace offering.
*Wish them well and take your leave.*
Mail Gloves
Magister Yarrow is dead.
*A sudden shudder jolts through its body so violently that it drops to its knees, stunned into silence.*
*The lizard remains in a deep slumber.*
It means your journey draws to a close. Do stick around for its finale though. Because...
New Vignette
*The priest collects himself. His eyes still burn, but his words are ice.*
Though I&apos;d much rather &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the two of us once more.
Will we be able to set sail?
Cage Close
Well, I&apos;m sure whoever cared about him will be very sad. You, however, have a job to do. &lt;i&gt;An exceedingly important job. &lt;/i&gt;Don&apos;t let this distract you.
I didn&apos;t ask for your opinion, savage - I asked why you&apos;re here. Now ANSWER ME!
*Refuse to assist. You&apos;ve other matters at hand.*
&lt;i&gt;Godwoken. &lt;/i&gt;I should have known it would be you, in the end.
Soaked Book
*Ask why she&apos;s concerned about Fort Joy.*
*KXXX*
That makes me feel better. Thanks!
It&apos;s like learnin&apos; how to walk again, &apos;cept someone&apos;s tied yer boots together.
Even if the dwarves escape attack, she&apos;ll go down in history as a monster.
Food! Yum!
*Say that you would be a more powerful host than it could possibly imagine... if it can handle you.*
Dear Lucian, I pledge my brother&apos;s life. Please return.
Every moment is a choice. That&apos;s the one I made, and it&apos;s the one I&apos;ll live with.
She ran off in the direction of Cloisterwoods. I do hope she made it away from those Magisters in time. Poor thing...
What would he have to gain by killing me? I need to keep my guard up...
I&apos;m glad to hear it. I ought to see if the Bishop and the others survived though - without them, this whole mission is for naught.
*A voice rises within your skull. It is the one you are sworn to. It is the God King.*
Your faith serves you, sister! Hold it. Use it. &lt;i&gt;Feel it. &lt;/i&gt;I promise it is not in vain.
A duel? Ha! Where do think you are, snake-face? Palace grounds? But if it&apos;s a good guttin&apos; you&apos;re looking for I&apos;ll be glad to bash in another lizard&apos;s brains.
You watch my back, I&apos;ll watch yours?
Painting of Rhalic
Maximum AP
Perhaps... you are not so... &lt;i&gt;HUNGRY&lt;/i&gt;... as I am.
I will scour this world in search of Sadha, and if by mortal means she eludes me, I will take divinity for the purpose.
Slash
*Bow before the Princess Zenthia.*
We &lt;i&gt;won&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;let that happen.
Sometimes you choose wrong. Them&apos;s the breaks.
Elven Axe
Armour of Frost Scroll
*You can&apos;t pause here! Explain that there&apos;s too much to be done.*
We destroyed the mirrors and found a way out.
Then there&apos;s Justinia. I&apos;ve got to get to Arx, and soon, if I want to keep that Deathfog out of her hands.
Oh yes - *cough* - many. I even saw Lucian die.
*He smiles broadly and looks away. You&apos;re not sure but you could swear he just &lt;i&gt;winked&lt;/i&gt; at you.*
*The Paladin stares at you for an uncomfortable long minute.*
The Divine Order&apos;s all that stands between you and a Voidwoken&apos;s throat. If you&apos;re against the Order, miss, you&apos;re a traitor to us all.
*Agree and go to prison.*
*Ask what she&apos;s doing in Arx.*
