No matter - he&apos;ll face justice either way. If you catch sight of that dog, tell me or my men at once, understand? There might even be a reward in it for you...
*Say that is impossible. She is the god here, not you.*
I&apos;s waist-height to a lizard and you don&apos;t hear &apos;e giving out. Just don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
We were unable to create a working story. Your add-on setup might be invalid. The game will continue with the setup from the savegame.
I know a good arm when I see one. I&apos;ll tell my cousin Reimond what you did. He&apos;s real high up in the Order, and he&apos;s visiting Driftwood as we speak. Could be he has some good work for you.
Multiplayer options.
Escape boat? I never even saw one. Guess I was knocked out cold.
Self preservation is a&lt;i&gt; petty concern &lt;/i&gt;- I must put the spiritual above the corporeal... I must finish!
A thousand years? Gods, the walls of this pit have leeched a whole millennium from me.
*The guard ignores you... then winks.*
Oh my. You&apos;re undead. &lt;i&gt;Darling, why didn&apos;t you say?!&lt;/i&gt;
Searching: [1]%
We&apos;ve looked. He&apos;s not here, and didn&apos;t leave a clue as to where he went. The search is pointless.
*Wonder why something like that would be of interest to him.*
*Say you were told that you&apos;d be venturing into your inner soul by coming here. Is that what this place is?*
Necklace of the Forest
I&apos;m grateful for your kindness. I needed time to think. Took some time to think. I had a good friendship with Jonathan while it lasted. I&apos;d rather celebrate that than mourn what can never be.
Shh, dark words should not sully those honeyed lips.  All will be well.
*Protest. You&apos;ve got every bit the skill and strength of any warrior.*
Ceremonial Twohander
*Ask who he is.*
*Insist - but the rest of the Seven? What of them?*
Peck
The Vulture&apos;s Claws
You know me, do you not?
Quercus... after all the Shield has done... do you think it&apos;s time?
Electrified Blood
What is your pleasure, m&apos;lord? Our best vintage is, er, unavailable. But I may have a delicious cider in the cupboard, if you&apos;d allow...
Oven
*Draw your weapon and attack.*
*Her casual dismissal of his insults seems to unsettle him somewhat. Uncertainty sours his face.*
No matter. You&apos;ll fail, just like them.
We showed Mordus&apos; amulet to Lohar as proof of his death.
Put the gloves on and return to Gawin.
Stop it! Someone, please, help!
Black Ring Warg
Interesting. Quercus, what do you make of this?
*A smile spreads across his face. He holds out his hand...*
The Lone Wolves were hired to kill Godwoken. No surprises there.
You &lt;i&gt;betrayed&lt;/i&gt; me. You used me to bring death to my own people...
You have killed Sadha, but you didn&apos;t destroy the fruit of your union! What was born in flame must perish in flame - as must you!
Hm. Seems someone&apos;s been digging rather hastily.
*Tell him that it seems he&apos;s been cursed with some form of madness - but you have the means to cure him, if he stands down.*
*Nod and take your leave.*
*Sigh.* Of course you can. Look at you...
*You summon your magic and a tiny light flickers. You&apos;re kneeling in a clear pool of liquid. It isn&apos;t blood...*
Can you smell it over the stink of the water? Millennia of mulch. Those woods are ancient.
Mia, the Faithful One
*Tell him you were sent to find him by the spirit of an Ancestor Tree he felled.*
*You&apos;re just sorry it came at the cost of his daughter.*
*Though your spell tore through him like a spear through flesh, Duna looks grimly happy - if haggard.*
Wood Equip
Be quick. I don&apos;t have much attention to spare.
*Tell him he&apos;s got the right dwarf, but you prefer to be called &apos;Beast&apos;.*
*Say that you&apos;re fine with that - the sooner you can leave this place behind, the better.*
*Ifan strides up to the Magister, speaking in a calm and controlled voice. Though you can&apos;t hear what he whispers, the Magister&apos;s face turns whiter than snow as he hands a note to Ifan with shaking hands.*
*Point out that the Magisters abandoned him. He doesn&apos;t owe them anything.*
Hero&apos;s Plate
*Her memories flow into you, as water to a stream. You are Taryan Graye, you are Godwoken, but you will not be Divine. You know this because you are in love with a colleague and rival.*
Spiked Floor Close
I know what you are, wolf. You &lt;i&gt;reek&lt;/i&gt; of Source.
*Her eyes soften and crinkle as she smiles.*
*Change your mind and agree to help. Ask what to do.*
*Back away. You don&apos;t trust this magic, whatever it is.*
Depends which one. Most of &apos;em seem a little too earnest for my taste. But Malady? She&apos;s my kind of gal.
Dragonfall
*He stops his humming and gives you a suspicious look.*
Force Splitscreen
&lt;i&gt;NO!&lt;/i&gt;
Slow that gallop, troll-jockey! What makes ya think I should let ya do that?
Exploration Theme 04 Cello
Rename Player
[OUTLAW] *Say that it&apos;s bad luck to gamble on the unknown; what are the stakes?*
The oil there burns still.
Beyond this altar, my servant toils to free secrets from a captive enemy. He is taking too long. Do whatever you can to uncover the knowledge...
He&apos;s turned cold. Not cruel, exactly, just... harsh. Dispassionate to a fault.
Carved from an ancient metal-like material, the wand is heavier than it appears. Etched along the shaft is the symbol of the Source King, Braccus Rex.
GET THE HELLS AWAY FROM ME!
Point Of Hatred
As the new Mother, Sebille found a great forest, and founded a new elven homeland. Elves flocked to her, and worshipped her as a goddess. Sebille swore never to kill again. But once in a while she&apos;d look at her needle, and smile.
Luxuriously soft leather makes these boots perfect for late night boarding parties.
Well, I can trace it all back to Braccus Rex, of course. Many of us opposed his reign. Few dared to speak against him, though.
And the Seven were punished for their transgression.
The vile magic of the Soul Jar binds us here. We cannot die, but nor can we live.
Origin
*Grunt.*
*The spirit acknowledges your presence with a slight bow.*
*Leave her be.*
What is it? Can&apos;t you... can&apos;t you see I&apos;ve got enough on my hands as it is...?
It doesn&apos;t have a seam, I can&apos;t -
*Ask if he&apos;s alright. It&apos;s not like him to be so... sullen.*
I cannot say. What I do in this kitchen... it&apos;s all I have.
At one time, I thought we could...
*Guffaw. You would never snog and tell!*
Emmie! Attack!
*Say you&apos;re not sure. You fell into the water and were nearly lost.*
A vile-scented draught capable of softening your strength.
*You&apos;re too late. The melody has taken hold of her mind.*
This man is a Dreamer: as you know I need a word with him. You may wait here while I speak.
*Divinity has eluded you so far, but life - life beats strong within you, here and now.*
*The ruined beacon is covered in Eternal runes, detailing the history of the people that crafted it. A history that is cut off rather abruptly.*
Storage Chest
Sir Lora
[MYSTIC] *Clap your palm against your head. This is Horrororsleep. It... isn&apos;t... real!*
It is not luck; it is her will.
Fellas are adorable. Consider my weapon stowed.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. What became of the beggar and his dog, we do not know.
*Look her over. She&apos;s rooted to the elven trees... but what does that mean, exactly?*
Elemental Affinity
We cannot rest until Lord Arhu is found - Arx needs him.
Background
Draught of Finesse
*Ask for a reminder of what you need to do.*
Attack_Skill_Cast_3
Wait! I haven&apos;t finished in Fort Joy.
Gareth plans to seize the Lady Vengeance and escape. First, we need to clear Magister defences from the shore.
Elodi rewarded us for helping her.
What&apos;s this all about?
Poor thing. I don&apos;t know what happened to you to make you think that way, but believe you me: A pint ain&apos;t the beginning or the end of it.
Now: Onward!
You won&apos;t regret it. Not when you hear what I&apos;ve got to say. We need to be quick though; you never know when the Magisters are gonna haul you off.
*Say that sounds about right.*
Map Folder
Well, I should keep looking, then. I promised I&apos;d help!
Arhu and Zandalor finding Lucian.
&lt;i&gt;INTRUDER!&lt;/i&gt;
Roost Anlon. I own this place. I&apos;d ask you to introduce yourself, but I already know who you are, &lt;i&gt;Lohse&lt;/i&gt;. Or do you prefer being called &apos;Godwoken&apos;?
Keep your armour nice and burnished, now.
We have spent centuries trying to escape this tower, but our power was too weak. There was no hope of freedom.
*Wordlessly he exhales towards you, a great torrent of anger and rage... but something has changed. This new Sallow anger is more pure, more refined, more confident and sure... and &lt;i&gt;more powerful.*&lt;/i&gt;
*It does not react.*
Tsk tsk, handsome. I must consider your merits before I answer your questions. Why, I wouldn&apos;t tease you with a gift I could never offer! You don&apos;t think me... &lt;i&gt;cruel&lt;/i&gt;, do you?
*Ignore the question and ask why they&apos;ve had such problems with the undead.*
You look like you&apos;re worth a little more than that. Get lost, elf. Mama here is paying for both of you.
Take the wheel, Cap&apos;n! Take the wheel! Hahahahaha!
Ok
Although smaller than the real thing, this replica is no less impressive.
Wood Axe
Urgh. How can one be seasick when one has no stomach!?
*All around you is a cacophony of wails, whimpers and cries for help. You try to shut them out, and pray with even more desperate fervour.*
*Say that you need to access the remains of Lucian the Divine.*
You&apos;re right! I&apos;m going out in the world, and I&apos;m going to make my mum proud!
I ain&apos;t no gentleman, and you don&apos;t look like no lady.
What news? Have you mastered your Source? Are you powerful enough to proceed?
*The black candle glows with eerie, heatless light.*
*Tell him his people believed he&apos;d want to see you.*
If you&apos;ve the stomach for such an ungodly task, I won&apos;t keep you from it. Perhaps you could inflict the pain that&apos;s needed... but it is a devil&apos;s business.
*Pass your hand across the flat of the altar-top and away, as if wiping the slate clean.*
Perhaps, but they cannot take a Shrieker by surprise. It will eviscerate their numbers as it did before.
*Tell him Joe&apos;s gone... somewhere lovely. A farm, or something like that.*
I wouldn&apos;t be so sure.
Ah, cuttin&apos; him down a second time will be even more satisfying than the first. And &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;time, it&apos;ll be permanent.
The secret of my soul. The strange promises of dreams. I value them more highly now even than divinity.
*Tell her she&apos;s a good dog.*
This ethereal mace glimmers with Source and shadow.
Hmm.
*Urge Gareth to calm. His cruelty is no less than Alexandar&apos;s. He must overcome his rage.*
In fact, that&apos;s what started all the trouble in the first place. The Magisters nearly lost their minds when they saw me with it...
*Ask why they were making weapons.*
*Ask if they have somewhere they can lie low.*
Poisoned Tomato
Only thing we managed were t&apos;close that door behind us and get us stuck. S&apos;posed to be another door out there, but never could find it.
*He nods.*
Rotate/Zoom Camera&lt;br&gt;[1] - Toggle Tooltips
Glad I made it, too. I&apos;m pretty sure there&apos;s more Deathfog out there than actual air. *Cough* Arx is barely more than a mess of corpses - the work of the Dwarven queen, I&apos;m told.
