*Say you heard him fine: he doesn&apos;t suffer fools... and you&apos;re not a fool.*
Malady told me that my demon lives in Arx. While I hunt Dallis, Malady will look for a way to weaken him.

*Fane bows his head and Source starts to swirl around his bones.*
If ever I had a home it has long since gone up in the smoke of Deathfog along with so many elves.
*Tell him that if you&apos;re to help, you need to know what he is doing in this place.*

Still, you look as guilty as a wolf in a henhouse. What do you have to say for yourself?
The red-scaled Godwoken has come, as I foresaw. And as I feared.
*Seize back control in fury. You don&apos;t understand - she lied to you! The King didn&apos;t destroy the Eternals, the Gods did!*
Now if you&apos;re quite done arguing, we have a world to save. Come, we must return to our research.
*Ask if she can remember any of her family, or friends.*

It has been a hard journey to godhood. I am a champion and a hero. But have I been righteous? Have I earned the powers of the Gods?
We passed the Path of Blood and journeyed on.
*Ask him what he has in mind.*
*Your hands merge together, your world twisting. Looking down you see you&apos;re holding a barrel marked with a fatal warning: Deathfog.*
Enter the arena blindfolded.
Look, I&apos;m in no mood to argue. Just get out of here, before I change my mind.
That won&apos;t get you anywhere. Use the other door.

Who will be next to fight?
All the powers that a Godwoken needs are documented in these tomes - the Gallery is the most important part of the whole Academy as far as I&apos;m concerned.
I am... a man with no name. They call me the Shadow Prince, but that is rather dramatic and in fact, rather incorrect.

Ah, the Second Passion of Lucian. A beautiful work, truly.

Oil Source
There&apos;s a clue in the name. He&apos;s a god, or something that wants to be a god. Continue to march to the Seven&apos;s beat, and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find out exactly what he is.
Uru Ydra
This? This belongs to Dallis - or the Hammer, as you might have heard her monickered... I&apos;m just having a tinker with it, to try and figure it out...
No, I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re not...

A simple note written with a speedy hand.
Soon I am quite well again. Then we make another attempt...
*Pause. He&apos;s looking for a way off the island in the middle of a ruin?*
*You see your life flash before your eyes, every memory flitting by like a moth&apos;s wings at a lantern. The vision reaches the present moment and diverges into multiple strands, impossible to keep track of. *

Something seems to be blocking the way...
Look! Look, it&apos;s him! He has come, true to his word.
I gave you my answer already - &lt;i&gt;no.&lt;/i&gt;
By the Seven, this thing smells.
What cruelty!
*He peers deep into the darkness veiling your face, looking for a trick. Doesn&apos;t seem to find one. Yet.*
*Say your kind acts out of selflessness, not fear. You will rebuild; academies the world over deserve elven scholarship.*
We&apos;re &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; it&apos;s the collusion between the Magisters and the Black Ring that drew the Voidwoken here. To think they blamed all Sourcerers! The only question remaining is... why?
The Seekers find and protect Sourcerers with special talents. Perhaps we fit the bill.
I... I lost it while trying to take the orc temple. I lost half my troop as well - that place was too  heavily trapped.
*His eyes narrow.*
Privacy Disclaimer
*Tell her to hold on - this discussion isn&apos;t over.*
I&apos;ve made more money today than in the last month combined, thanks to a group of Magisters who were in &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a hurry they didn&apos;t have time to haggle.

And these days, he&apos;s colder than ever. I&apos;d call it madness if he wasn&apos;t so very... exact about it.
Not quite. You see, despite the... unfortunate circumstances of the ceremony, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a married man.

Right good of ya. Best we head off, then. We&apos;ve got business to attend to.

Cannot reassign [1].&lt;br&gt;The character is a Game Master.
I watched an elf spend hours trying to force his way into a lizard&apos;s chest. Eventually he threw it into the flames, but still it sits there: indestructible.
A Voidwoken spike should be handled with care.&lt;br&gt;But if combined with essence as hot as the sun it may turn paper to scroll.
It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;her!&lt;/i&gt; The wrinkled human that stole my mask. Please, I must speak with her.
Value of trader offer:
Damn. That doesn&apos;t bode well. Onwards and upwards.
Egotistical
You&apos;ll be better off. Everyone&apos;s on edge. Voidwoken flock to these parts like crows to carrion.
The Silent Monks are dead.
Duna&apos;s Sanctum
Then you are my next meal - and a meaty one, at that. My soul is within my grasp!
We left the oasis and the dreamscape. The glowing portal closed behind us.

It&apos;s right there in the name, is it not? We seek. The details are for a different place and a different time.
The yellow clinky things? My master has those. He has lots! They&apos;re in his sock, so no-one can steal &apos;em. He&apos;s very clever, my master!
We are going to check the lower deck for survivors.
*He needn&apos;t bother. Tell him Dorian is dead.*

You&apos;ve made it far, Sourcerer. Too far.
*Point out that the tinkerer is skilled enough to take out Magisters. Surely he&apos;s skilled enough to sneak out of a run-down factory?*
I need to see the effects of eating these fish - &lt;i&gt;firsthand&lt;/i&gt;, if you understand me...
That was the wrong answer!
*Tell her half the truth. Say you met Rhalic, god of the humans, and he called you his champion. Leave off the part where he told you to get rid of Lohse.*

*You&apos;re confused - Dallis and Vredeman aren&apos;t old.*
*Looking closer, you know what this must be - a weapon. A Deathfog weapon. Justinia&apos;s intentions are becoming all too clear.*
*The priestess has cast her comrade&apos;s arm aside. She jabs her staff forward. It seems to connect with something unseen - a faint howl of pain catches your ear...*
*The spirit laughs, pleased with his own obnoxiousness.*
Then there was the stench of those men. The burn of the ropes. The jeers and the kicks.
...sssssssssssssssoft.
*Ask Red Prince if he&apos;d like to join you for a... private moment.*
Ha! What do I need your help for, freshie. By the looks of you, you couldn&apos;t find a bush in a brothel.

You would help me. How ironic... But the task would not be an easy one. Radeka is a canny one: cat to your mouse.
*After all that&apos;s happened here, ask what in the Void he&apos;ll do now.*
*Tell her you need to think about it.*

So, you&apos;ve read my contract. Now you know my target. And what does that look in your eye mean?
The design of this crossbow is known as &quot;Halla&apos;s Hawk&quot; after the legendary Elven warrior famed for wielding one just like it.
*The spirit of the Defiler remains on his back, dead eyes staring into space. The arrow protrudes upwards from his forehead like a profane flower.*

Right. Exactly. I thought it was... well, nothing. More of the same - a sprite, a spirit. But it&apos;s a lot more powerful than I imagined.

Jahan will help me, but first I must do him a favour - go to a haunted island and kill &apos;the Advocate&apos;.
*Nod. You&apos;re the reigning champion of Fort Joy.*
You left her &lt;i&gt;alive?! &lt;/i&gt;I won&apos;t let that foul bitch get away with this - I have to stop her!
*Excuse yourself, you really don&apos;t have time to talk right now...*
The spirit of the tree may have much to say.
In Orivand&apos;s chamber, we had a vision of ash and flame. A mysterious voice told us to seek another piece of armour in the &apos;garden of stone and death&apos;, away from Reaper&apos;s Eye.
