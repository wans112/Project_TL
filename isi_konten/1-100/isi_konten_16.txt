Hmm. The waters run deeper than I would have anticipated... my business remains my own for now, but perhaps we shall talk again at some point...
A black cat! A herald of wisdom in my homeland. How fortuitous.
*The knight leans in, a strange look of panic in his eyes that doesn&apos;t quite match his powerful voice.*
*The cat looks to the fish, then back to you. And again. And yet again: the fish, then you. Finally, it scarfs down its meal and begins to drool.*
*She looks you in the eye for, you realise, the first time.*
[SEBILLE] *Agree. Nothing wrong with tit for tat.*
A black cat. Beauteous creature. Almost as graceful as I am.
This is no place to stop for a chat - let&apos;s keep moving.
Maybe I was too harsh back in the Joy. We all do things we&apos;re not proud of.
*She jolts awake with a gasp, golden light pouring from her eyes.*
I don&apos;t like the look of you - you&apos;re coming with us, until we get your story straight.
You earned it just by being...
&apos;Here lies an unnamed bag of bones&lt;br&gt;Found long after the flood.&apos;
Lohar? Then...
*Tell him there&apos;s some kind of logic to it, twisted though it may be; there are both sides in all beings, after all.*
Oh, sir, I can&apos;t say I know. Besides, I&apos;m not at liberty to discuss...

They were struck down in their prime, just like the elves lost in Deathfog. I can&apos;t but admit to a hint of sympathy.
The candles, Lohse - they are souls. They are the source of his power. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is how we weaken him. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is how you save yourself.
Chest of a Dwarven Hero
Alas, I did not have the time to see it used. I had no choice but to hide it when your damned Seven chased me to this cave.
Saheila says the Mother Tree is sick and dying.
That ain&apos;t like Marla. Ain&apos;t like her to pull the silent treatment, either. Something&apos;s going on.
*Take your leave.*
I&apos;ve got no patience for lies.
The Magisters need help avoiding the cavern&apos;s traps. We should tread carefully.
Chairs
Really! It&apos;s the lack of manners that I find so unforgivably disgraceful.
*She melts into you and nuzzles her face into the crook of your neck. Her body is warm - warmer than it should be, her weight comforting and solid against you.*
[SEBILLE] *Alright. Yes. But, you tell the rat, you&apos;re not ugly.*
Can you lift the grate? You&apos;re ever so much stronger than me...
Heal
*Ask why she doesn&apos;t simply heal that injured fellow if she has the makings for potions.*
Greetings! May the Seven circle you, and keep you safe. Ah, it&apos;s a wonderful day, wouldn&apos;t you agree?
Sometimes it seems all the realm is hostile to life. Stay sharp, stranger.
*Ask who this... &apos;Princess&apos; is.*
I truly have no choice, have I? Very well: I must put the fate of all lizards in your hands.
The plaque on this well-framed piece proclaims the subject to be one Maxos, wizard exemplary.
Poisoned Knife
Fun? You&apos;re not - not entirely there. Or not here. Something - something&apos;s wrong...
*Tell him he&apos;s lost the moral authority to judge the Godwoken.*
*Ignore his childish comments and ask him where, exactly, you are.*
*Chuckle and say that you&apos;re more useful than you look. Promise.*
Well good thing I weren&apos;t singin&apos; that one when yeh showed up, eh? Got a right-good rebel whooper on hand, though. And another... well, it ain&apos;t so respectful, but royal guardsfolk on &apos;oliday always ate it up.
*He twirls his knife between his fingers.*
Sure does, though ain&apos;t gonna be you, by the looks of it.
Steel Greaves
*The spirit of a man cowers on the floor of the cell, his head tucked down...*
Pick
Explore Lucian&apos;s tomb.
I&apos;ll need to watch my step in here...
Stone Tablet
I&apos;m done playing your silly games!
*A mischievous smile spreads across her lips.*
We&apos;ve gotta get out of here. The sooner the better. Just jump in the boat when you&apos;re ready...
*Say the word &apos;countless&apos;.*
Would you rush &lt;i&gt;perfection...?&lt;/i&gt; It will be ready when its ready.
Very well. You are a fellow Wolf, after all.
*She cocks her head the other way, brow furrowed, then breaks into a huge smile.*
I met Zaleskar in the swamps. He gave me a powerful crossbow and a single poison-cloud arrow.
*Tell the skeleton that you&apos;re not looking for trouble - you&apos;re just a traveller passing through the swamp.*
Skeletal Graverobber
But before Braccus surrendered himself to the God King, I persuaded him not to. Not even the legendary mad Source King could resist my will.
Would you like to synchronize save games with your Steam account?&lt;br&gt;You can change this later in Options.
That issue is... not as pressing as you might imagine.
*Ask what he finds so intriguing about the trolls.*
Strange... I feel a little better, like a weight&apos;s been lifted...
I can&apos;t believe they have any involvement in this - they&apos;d be fools to act against us...
You are the Prime Scion. You are the daughter of the Mother tree. You are the one that will replace her. You must take root now. The Mother is sick. Soon she dies.
Good wishes. Keep that smile wide.
Mey s&apos;aravel tay de larentou chamorie?
*Ask her for some advice on how to proceed unhindered.*
Got one on you, do you m&apos;lady?
Lo, bonebag! Bow before Septa the Ineffable - bow before it&apos;s too late!
Did you show mercy or strength? Did you sacrifice others as Lucian had done? Did you regret becoming Divine? Did you wish you&apos;d surrendered the power that runs through your veins, and sealed the Veil?
*Tatcher shrugs. They sip their beers.*
Follow Elodi.
&lt;br&gt;From [1]: [2][3]%
*Bleep-buzzt* PAPA&apos;S PERMISSION GRANTED! YOU MAY PASS, FRIEND, AND - *gurrRBBb...bbbrrRRRZZTT!!!*
We&apos;ll do more than &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, though. Feeling thirsty?
Yes, I will find you. I will be with you.
*Offer your condolences. She has seen more brutality than any young person ever should.*
Available Skills:
I&apos;ll take the goods, alright. But I&apos;m not just letting this go.
Careful now! Careful! RACAW! You don&apos;t want to know what happened to the last CYNICAWKAW who passed my way.
*Leave them to their reunion.*
*Focus on his bitterness.*
As the head said, don&apos; o&apos;en the chest.
&lt;i&gt;I do not want your peace, little Scion. I want to feel complete.&lt;/i&gt;
Your fate is written, and Lucian&apos;s light shines on you.
Arena of the One
Chief...
Gwydian feared the great power within him. He did his best to hide it, but something so beautiful cannot stay hidden forever. A kind couple beseeched me to look after him, to teach him how to control his powers. I was happy to help... but it was never destined to last.
*Cough*
[NOBLE] *Say that happy is the owl who feasts well. Who is their generous benefactor?*
In my unquestioned devotion, Lucian led me astray. Not by choice, not by design, just by... being.
He worked for me. He wasn&apos;t respectful. He bandied my name around the forest as if it were his own. So I treated him for his insolence. The treatment worked.
*Say that Lucian is dead - it is not for him to decide the fate of the world any longer.*
HA! Respect?! You wouldn&apos;t know respect if it cut off your tongue and shoved it down your throat.
Come on over here, big boy, and I&apos;ll tell you...
*Say you don&apos;t think so; it&apos;s natural for like to seek like and fear difference.*
Smash your weapon into the ground, knocking down non-allied characters in front of you, and hitting them for [1]. Also clears non-cursed surfaces and clouds.
You&apos;re finally free now, Sebille. I hope you&apos;ll follow up on my concerns as eagerly as you&apos;ve followed up on yours...
[LOHSE] *Tell her you&apos;re not too keen on meeting &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;thing again. It never ends well.*
Through the portal, we found ourselves in Horrorsleep.
Liar! Traitor! I hope he rips your guts out your ears!
...the esteemed House of War. Congratulations.
*Recall Braccus Rex&apos;s research notes.*
Yup. One thing the old woman taught me is to ignore anybody sayin&apos; they&apos;re better than me.
Piss off, &apos;less you got money.
*Say that you haven&apos;t met anyone called Wainslow.*
*Cecil&apos;s spirit tries to shake your shoulders, death failing to ease his panic in the least.*
Like I said: beware of gods bearing gifts.
*Tell the creature to slow down, you can&apos;t understand a thing.*
*Demand to know what happened to all of the others who were on board previously.*
Still knockin&apos; around here, are ya?
It all depends. What would you do?
Paladin Adlard
Force kill app
Ugly sight, isn&apos;t it?
I am the new Divine. May I serve the people with honour.
I see you&apos;ve already noticed where my private chambers are. Perhaps you&apos;d care to join me there for some further intellectual discourse...
Away with you. At once!
*The ghost lets out a plaintive gurgle, his spirit reliving the damage inflicted upon his body...*
In the arena, a childhood friend gave me a key to the Fort. But which door does it fit?
Perhaps my people have ascended to some new realm. Or perhaps your &apos;Gods&apos; are merely a folk memory.
You can see the souls of the dead. And now you can feed from them to your hungry heart&apos;s content.
It was their time.
Looks like I was right. You only have yourself to blame for this!
*Her voice crackles and dissipates in your mind.*
When you&apos;ve been around as long as I have, you pick up a thing or two. What&apos;d you have in mind?
Sorry for the trouble. Enjoy your day!
I see... thank you, nonetheless. Perhaps I&apos;ll learn more about his final moments some day.
Would you look at that? Looking out for number one. I like that. But I&apos;ve already been bled dry.

Attacking wastes your time and annoys me. I don&apos;t like being annoyed.

*Move towards her.*
I&apos;d give anything for a fresh bit &apos;o fish, I would.
*Her eyes narrow with incredulity. She spits on the ground beside your foot.*
We met Malady near the demon&apos;s house, ready to depart for Adramahlihk&apos;s home plane in search of his weakness.
That&apos;s the truth. For me, for you, for everyone in this place.
Well now, was that so hard? And I was beginning to think wolves just can&apos;t read. Ha!
*Say that this is incorrect - YOU killed the cook, not the ex-Magister - the bounty should go to you!*
Imp. Thing. From impzzz. Wuzzz on a thing.
Don&apos;t wait for me, lads. You have to get her! She&apos;s too dangerous!
*Tell him you intend to go further. A &lt;i&gt;lot &lt;/i&gt;further.*
No. Nothing would induce me to trust a lizard. Night night...
I am... I am no Magister. Not in spirit. Please - see reason!
*She embraces you for a long moment, her face pressed to your shoulder, then steps back, wiping a tear from her eye.*
I am weary of the wait. I need to battle!
I mean, I had read all the leading authorities on it, but I didn&apos;t think...
Summon the Doctor
Change Folder Name:
*Tell him not to be too greedy. Frankly, you need all the Source you can get.*
&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; can use Source. It helped me to keep the monster from winning entirely. I don&apos;t need it anymore  - I want you to have it.
Possessed...? It&apos;s... the things it&apos;s planning to do.
*You pause. Lucian was the Divine - why would he want to harm anyone in the Academy, from where his successor ought to rise?*
Fork
Arrow Smokescreen
All across the realm he was worshiped and adored.
Find Source yet? Keep sniff-sniffing.
*Ifan shrugs and turns to survey the environment, squinting into the distance.*
