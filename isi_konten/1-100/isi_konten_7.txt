I know it&apos;s the same ol&apos; sea breeze I&apos;ve always smelled. But it&apos;s different now, with Malady gone. I don&apos;t know how to explain. Maybe &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;do - oh divine one. Hehe.
*You turn away from the sunset, only to see that Stanley has dropped to one knee. He holds out a ring to you with a sheepish grin.*
*Gently ask the Djinn what he did then.*
The switch opens a secret passage into the fort. There we should seek the Phylactery Room, where Withermoore&apos;s Soul Jar is likely hidden.
Haha! I&apos;m Lohse, of course. Isn&apos;t that obvious?
*Actually, you&apos;re not so sure about this. You&apos;d prefer someone with a little more... everything.*
The chanterelle is known as an elusive mushroom. It&apos;s said that &apos;chanterelle&apos; was once a shy, beautiful woman who was pursued by so many suitors that she fled to the forest and begged the gods to hide her forever. Ever-obliging, the gods turned her to a mushroom, but it&apos;s said that those who drink its extract can hide nearly as well as she did.
You feel it, don&apos;t you? That burning cold?
So your passenger &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;doesn&apos;t like music, does it.
You know what? I&apos;m feeling a bit peckish. And Stingtail mentioned a cook, as it happens: fellow named Griff.
*Ask why they won&apos;t listen to him - didn&apos;t he serve in their ranks?*
She used some form of domination device on me... forcing my hands to do her bidding, and half-ruined them in the process.
Trap
*Assure the rat there&apos;s none taken.*
Very amusing. Although you&apos;re not wrong. A scrap merchant is all I am right now. Here, see for yourself.
Rhalic, of the humans.
Dead men can&apos;t be choosers, can they. No, they can&apos;t be choosers...
You look almost exactly like every other dwarf out there, just as every human looks like every other human.
Combine items
Arran the Raucous One suggested we challenge Murga, the arena champion.
*Beast leans for one last kiss, then pulls away and caresses your cheek.*
*Wonder again how one might bypass the Path of Blood.*
*In that moment, the spirit&apos;s identity is as clear as the north star on a winter night: this is Duna, the God of all dwarves.*
Don&apos;t tempt me - the Doctor will be displeased if I have my fun without asking. &lt;i&gt;Go!&lt;/i&gt;
A Sourcerer named Vredeman has been teaching Bishop Alexandar to master the powers needed to become Divine.
Alexandar is dead and beyond our help.
Not... dead. Yet not... alive. I know you understand...
My soul. Mine to claim! What remains is yours. May it ease your journey... and your conscience.
Will you sacrifice the power you deserve to save these fractured spirits? They are mere fuel. Devour them and ascend.
I know you can do better, Godwoken. I can sense you have a finely-honed sense of finesse. *Pouts.* Why wouldn&apos;t you show me what you could do?
*Sigh.* Do I &lt;i&gt;look &lt;/i&gt;like I am in a position to teach you anything? No, you need someone of flesh and bone.
CAWKAWRICKAW! CAW!
I&apos;ll half you with my sword if you don&apos;t mind your own business!
*Wish her well and take your leave.*
No, we were the prisoners of Braccus Rex on this isle: playthings to his will, victims to his foul experimentation. The red-robed jesters seek out his toys, but the pups are nothing to us.
Temple of Zorl-Stissa
*Howl!*
Two-Handed Forest Axe
This potion, a beautiful, swirling concoction smelling faintly of coconuts, grants resistance to water damage.
Uhnf - it won&apos;t *gasp* budge! I can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;breathe&lt;/i&gt;. I *gasp* can&apos;t *gasp* breathe!
Help me, Papa. The lady took something from me...
The Source Hunters, valiant though they were, could not have foreseen Braccus&apos; resurrection at the hands of the Cult of the Immaculates. We owe our very lives to two more of the very order that first fought to bring Braccus Rex to justice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Source King is dead. Yet his monuments still dot the land, a chilling but necessary reminder of his legacy of cruelty, greed, and arrogance.
Leaving Hand in Hand
I
Arhu&apos;s Journal
But if you refuse to obey me... &lt;i&gt;I will take it all back.&lt;/i&gt;
Coupling for us is a more ceremonial affair.
Worn Gate
I need &lt;i&gt;feedback&lt;/i&gt;, you see.
*The statue is as still as the air that surrounds it.*
*Ask it if trying to tear you down makes it feel big and strong.*
UNGH! Ma! Are you alright?! MA!
[UNDEAD] *Remark that Alexandar is but a mortal man. If he&apos;s all that&apos;s left, we&apos;re in dire straits indeed.*
[LOHSE] *Shake your head decidedly. One is enough, you don&apos;t intend to let more of them in!*
We were no sooner there than gone again. What a waste.
Innate Skills
Bear Die
It looks more like a passenger managed to slip their collar. And the rest... well, you see the evidence in front of you.
Claymore
And here I thought this day could get no worse. Please. *Ungh* Leave me. I&apos;ve much to mourn today.
Follow Your Own Path
The Hunters Hunted
*He leans in close and breathes through his nose, his tongue out... &lt;i&gt;tasting your odour...*&lt;/i&gt;
At first glance, this seems to be a functional weapon best used for backstabbing. However, closer inspection reveals that this estoc has seen better days; its blade is chipped and nocked, its hilt twisted.
The shackles broke and next thing I knew I was free. I stood alone outside the ruins of a fortress, snow-capped peaks all around me.
*Tell him to take care when he messes with Godwoken. He should choose his target wisely.*
*Sadha&apos;s spirit screams and looks to the heavens, searching for the dragons she&apos;d always hoped to spawn - and suddenly convulses, shaken by an unseen force.*&lt;br&gt;
And the House of War? Well, the House of War are in their element...
*Say you haven&apos;t noticed anything wrong with the locals.*
*You relent and the dwarf stumbles back, cradling his fractured arm and whimpering.*
No player profiles found, some options will be disabled until you create one!
*Follow their lead. Take a piece of heart, put it in your mouth, and chew.*
Hold on a moment there, lass.
*Promise him you&apos;ll do what you can.*
I will swear it, this covenant! If it will bring me back, I will swear it!
*Sacrifice one Source point to the device.*
*&apos;She&apos;? Ask him who he means.*
Candle
Listen to me, Lohse. And listen well, if you want to stay alive. I don&apos;t need you, but I chose you. Because you&apos;re strong, because you are receptive, because you have what it takes to reclaim a new life - for both of us.
Why? &lt;i&gt;Why&lt;/i&gt; did you and Lucian unleash the Deathfog? Why didn&apos;t you wait? I was almost there.
*Ask him to continue.*
I am using the mask to keep myself safe from the violence of this world. Who knows what evil it could do in the hands of some mortal witch.
Stand back, there.
Smelly person threw my ball away and I couldn&apos;t go fetch! Threw it off the balcony! So that was said. And then Master Arhu went away, and that was sad too. But then Master Arhu came back! That was nice! I love Master Arhu.
Is this level of uncertainty common amongst your kind?
*Politely invite him to tell you about what he has heard.*
*Fane shakes your hand off and tears out another page.*
Hail! Made it through alright, did you? Let&apos;s hope we can the same for the remainder of the party.
But- but-... no, that cannot be. What did you do with it? You must bring it here! If the Magisters were to find it...
[MYSTIC] *Take a solemn tone. You don&apos;t need to see the bodies to know their fellow Magisters are dead.*
*Say you want a chat with a woman named Cat. Where can you find her?*
Please, not like... the Void... the nothing...
Makeshift Staff
*The black candle glows with eerie, heatless light. If it&apos;s important to the demon, it may contain the key to saving Lohse from his clutches.*
Yes, Vredeman. It is time.
*Tell her she&apos;s an enigma from start to finish.*
*Say you knew him to be a fine physician.*
Giant Rock Rune Of Power
*Tell him not to be ridiculous. He can&apos;t keep you here.*
No! Not again. Get away from me!
Good! Now hurry! Get out of here before...
[SCHOLAR] *Note that such a wound is serious... but it shouldn&apos;t be bleeding like that. Something&apos;s amiss.*
Magic
*Tell her he has, but you have a couple hoops to jump through first.*
Your judgement of yourself clouds your judgement of others. You earn nothing. You learn nothing. You who are not fit to judge, you earn nothing.
Thief! How dare you? Someone, over here!
Quite the opposite, in fact. If you&apos;re anything to judge them by, they may be the worst of the lot.
*The shrine depicts Lucian the Divine, Avatar of the Seven Gods.*
Foggy White
You know not how. You know not why. But one thing you do know: this lever is broken.
Reward Chests
The Poisoner&apos;s Companion
*Nod. You&apos;re certain.*
*Blush. That&apos;s really sweet of him to say.*
Keepin&apos; it together, Bree?
*Bow your head. You never saw this treachery coming.*
*Ask him who wants to know.*
Hand it over? Oh... I... If I must. *Snort* A prince&apos;s orders are not to be denied.
You would let the Void run free so you can feel the joy of your skin sagging as you age? You would trade the sanctity of all the races for your flesh?
*Point in the direction of the barrel.*
*Ask why he doesn&apos;t seem concerned about Griff&apos;s missing items.*
*Tell her she&apos;s overindulging. If she doesn&apos;t slow it down, you&apos;ll remove her from the premises.*
It&apos;s showing signs of wear. Centuries of rain and hail take their toll.
She was so young... she didn&apos;t deserve to die like that.
True Brew: Penny Bun
Something is rotten in these hills, and I&apos;m going to find out what it is.
Restoration
*Pause for a moment. Ask if she&apos;s ever seen the ritual performed before.*
I don&apos;t have to explain my actions. Magisters are pigs - they deserve to be slaughtered and &lt;i&gt;eaten &lt;/i&gt;like pigs...
*He hums on.*
If you like that part, you&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;love &lt;/i&gt;what happened next: Some stuffy duke yanks off the lid, and good ol&apos; Beastie jumps out!
*Tell him that&lt;i&gt; The Sacrifice of Lucian &lt;/i&gt;has been stolen.*
&apos;To the Bluffs.&apos;
The Whites have betrayed the memory of Lucian, in the most heinous manner. We&apos;ve had our suspicions, but you provided us with proof. Collusion with the Black Ring! So we acted to put a stop to their treason.
Geomancer skills are Earth-based magic spells. High intelligence improves these skills. Read this book to learn this skill.
Foggy Beach
But everyone deserves to have the best life they can, dammit. People asked me why I turned against her. Well that&apos;s why. The sun &apos;n&apos; sea &apos;n&apos; fruits of the tree aren&apos;t just for royalty. They&apos;re for all of us.
*The totem stands dormant.*
*Demand the password, on the authority of Dallis herself.*
What? No - it can&apos;t be.
Xiuh will mourn Consul Zara, but will also be glad to know her effects are in your honoured claws, oh prince.
Persistent little flies.
[HERO] *Tell him you&apos;re very trustworthy, he need not worry.*
[SEBILLE] *Glare, and tell him that nothing is free. Including your name.*
*As the boat rocks downward, an elven prayer passes through your mind: &lt;i&gt;&apos;May the light of now and the light of then be my beacon.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
GREETINGS LINDER KEMM - LORD OF THE MANSION - NOBLE AND ERUDITE
A potent blast that wipes out all nearby surfaces.
*The Silent Monk stands with one arm outstretched, stroking the air in front of her.*
Killed the Divine&apos;s mewling spawn, have you? I don&apos;t blame you.
