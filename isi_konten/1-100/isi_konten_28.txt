Yes, I imagine you do. You&apos;re made of sterner stuff than I first gave you credit for.
And of those there were many.
*You claw desperately at the cave wall, trying to get enough purchase to crawl away...*
*Her eyes lock with yours. Her lids are heavy, her lips are moist.*
It&apos;s so refreshing, these days, to be able to say what you feel.
*With a few easy movements, Sebille slips out of her clothes and straddles you in all her naked glory; two heats hot against one another.*
The Godwoken ritual demands that I burn Blackroot and blood from an obsidian lancet in a special bowl, then inhale the smoke. Everything I need is in Siva&apos;s cellar.
Hmmm. Seems like nobody&apos;s home.
Let&apos;s see... three major houses govern the Ancient Empire. There&apos;s the House of Law, the House of War... now, what&apos;s the third?
&apos;West - Ancient Empire Consulate&lt;br&gt;East - City Square&lt;br&gt;South - City Gates&apos;
*The device crackles and pops, then whines pitifully. The shield surrounding the cell flickers off.*
Helmet Equip
*Ask once again if he&apos;s quite sure that this vision of a battlefield isn&apos;t drawn from memory - it&apos;s so &lt;i&gt;vivid.*&lt;/i&gt;
You&apos;ve found a Lockpick! To open a locked object, &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;use&lt;/font&gt; your Lockpick on it.
Knightly Sword
*Shrug. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Help - from the other Godwoken, presumably. Ask why the gods haven&apos;t come to you, too.*
It will be the finest piece I&apos;ve ever composed! Of this I am most certain.
I see you&apos;ve been up to no good. You&apos;re under arrest!
Down the hatch, then!
*The spirit ignores you, focused as it is on tearing the Source from its captive. It stinks of... dark magic.*
Scholar
*Tell her you&apos;ve already been to the vault and recovered the wand.*
...but perhaps. Perhaps there is hope.
*He recoils in disgust. But then, recognising her face... he grins.*
Medium Water Resistance Potion
Ryker&apos;s Piano
[BEAST] *Take your leave. You&apos;ve had enough of this self-serving maggot.*
*Tell her you&apos;d love to hear an original - something with a little more heft than the same old tavern jingles.*
Oh hi. So this turned out badly.
Teleporter Pyramid
I guess I am. But it&apos;s just normal to be scared. Nowhere isn&apos;t scary.
I could have saved them. I could have found a way.
Rivellon is in serious decline.
*The cub&apos;s face falls.*
BOCK-BOCK-But I see nothing but the Void lurking behind those pretty peepers. Kill him now or he will ki-ki-ki-CAW-kill us all later!
*From its depths, a faint voice howls. This must be the container that holds Lord Withermoore&apos;s soul.*
I call for you... From wind and water I call...
Odd. Perhaps it was washed away by the water?
Magister Ranley, Caulker&apos;s Mate of the Divine Eminence vessel, &lt;i&gt;Lady Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt; That&apos;s all the information I&apos;m giving to any of you lot, so stow your questions, lizard.
Rotten Chunk Of Flesh
How&apos;s that dignity of yours doin&apos;, mate?
I &lt;i&gt;hunger&lt;/i&gt; for you, Marcus. There&apos;s no stopping me now.
You again! No messenger could have done their duty properly in such a short time - go and deliver my letter, or I&apos;ll have you burned to a cinder!
*The fire inside you shivers...*
*The shambling creatures lay down their cards and push back their chairs*
[MYSTIC] *Smirk. You&apos;re sure they are. They certainly look like they need help.*
From time to precious time.
A note with the booby-trapped wedding cake suggested that Doctor Daeva was trying to kill Isbeil.
Power for my soul. This trade - &lt;i&gt;again.&lt;/i&gt;
It gives me joy to see you. You have made much of yourself. This is good. For we stand on the edge of the abyss. Are you prepared for the coming war?
*Tell him he&apos;s a terrible liar.*
*Tell her that the bard in the tavern seemed to be a fan. Ask if people often get starstruck around her.*
*Spit* What he did shames his people.
*Say that you thought it was in a precarious position, and sought to move it.*
Dawn 01
*The Master! He is the one you seek. If there&apos;s a link between him and the Lone Wolves, perhaps you should talk to Griff and find out what he knows.*
Venomous Amphibian
I left the Nameless Isle without meeting the Shadow Prince.
Any
*Say you&apos;re curious to know more about these friends of his.*
*She nods silently.*
These thick gloves are covered with sharp spines, ensuring that even unarmed attacks could cause serious damage.
Respect. Ha! Someone&apos;s got to keep this place runnin&apos;. Griff can&apos;t do it for free. Why d&apos;you gotta make this so hard?
*Offer him three fresh fish.*
*He stares at you, mouth open. His gaze drops to find, to his surprise, his knuckles white on a weapon in his hand. He smiles to himself. Gets back to work.*
*Go in for the kill. There&apos;s no justifying the beast&apos;s rampage.*
*She breaks into a huge, childlike grin as you approach.*
*Argue that his attitude is rather short sighted. Best to stand together in times like these.*
You expecting a tip? Well, here&apos;s one: skip the sweets and stick to salad, butterball!
That lingering rot is gone from the air.
Go on through, adventurer. We won&apos;t stop you.
*The man in front of you is clad in a ragtag assortment of garb. He looks up from repairing a battered instrument to smile and nod at you, one traveller to another.*
And if you should... I&apos;m sure the God King will find you worthy.
[RED PRINCE] *So she&apos;s a slave? Tell her to pack her things and follow you. She&apos;s yours now.*
[IFAN] *You &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; answers. If Gareth would stand in your way, Gareth must fall also.*
*Ask about this &apos;young one&apos;.*
*Say you&apos;d like to know who his master is.*
[UNDEAD] *Tell him you hope his clean conscience gives him comfort in the cold eternity ahead.*
Ha! Ain&apos;t no bein&apos; owed a favour from Sech Zapor. Fact, he told me he thinks you&apos;d make a great slave aboard the ship.
Do you know, I never thought to ask, between him purging me and casting me into a traitor&apos;s tomb.
*He bows hurriedly before returning to his duties.*
A warrior travelling the path of the One should not be collared like a pet. I suggest you see the tinkerer. You are capable of so much more.
*He draws himself up to a position approximating standing to attention.*
*Question the bird about its condition.*
Oughta keep that hand to yourself. I like a good hug now and again. But it&apos;s neither &apos;now&apos; nor &apos;again&apos; just yet.
*Wonder what&apos;s expected of a dragon&apos;s &quot;champion&quot;.*
If you&apos;ll excuse me, I need some air. Gods, you smell worse than the fish...
Be well. Good-bye.
You beastly thing. I abase myself serving an elf, and you reward me with that filth? Stay away from my bar, you hear? This is a &lt;i&gt;civilised &lt;/i&gt;establishment!
*Hold out your bloodless hands. No evidence of murder here!*
I am ready. I am READY. I AM ready.
The undead? Like your good self you mean.
Let it go. You did your best.
C&apos;mon, y&apos;stubborn hunk o&apos; garbage!
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;How weary you must be. How deserving of respite...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Yes. I&apos;ve accomplished more than I could have imagined. And I&apos;ve &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;than earned my right to see justice done.
*Prove your power; attack Braccus Rex.*
Stew is good, if you&apos;re thinking of eating.
Don&apos;t waste any of that false breath. I know what you are, Fane. You&apos;ll have time to think about your sins when the darkness comes for you once again.
You must think I&apos;m stupid. And I don&apos;t like when people call me stupid...
Incompatible with [1] [2]
Blood-Bound
You should leave.
Do you complain when the hurricane blows? Do you tell the volcano that it will suffer for burning your village?
Nutmeg
*Sneer at the quivering skeleton. How much gold is his life worth?*
[LOHSE] *Tell him he can join you on your great ascent!*
*Turn to take your leave.*
Are you sure you want to surrender?
Escape on Alexandar&apos;s ship.
Keep your distance, lizard. Your kind tend to attract missiles o&apos; rotten fruit, and I&apos;m not looking to get my good outfit stained.
*Give him alms.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Shake your head. Tell him to prepare himself.*
&lt;i&gt;Chm&apos;r doran!&lt;/i&gt;
Chief amongst her opponents was Tovah - Saheila&apos;s own mother.
*Say you most certainly have personal pride: you&apos;re no stranger to combs, powders and perfumes.*
*Look to the caged child, and then to the spirit. Who is he? What is his purpose?*
My thanks.
*Embrace him - and surreptitiously steal his purse.*
What did you do with your power?
Walk by some other path. This place is not for you to enter.
If the present is all that matters, you must take me as I am. Sunshine and shadow both.
Of course I&apos;m afraid of things. Heights. The dark. Even &lt;i&gt;spiders&lt;/i&gt;, truth be told.
Killing Contract
[These blood-stained notes contain the gruesome details of experiments done on prisoners here, including - interestingly - the amounts of Source that were extracted from each of them.]
Now now. You&apos;re among friends here, aren&apos;t you? Those who knows what lies beyond death.
I enjoy being forgotten. Leads to a much more tranquil existence.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without helping Corbin Day.
YOU&apos;LL REGRET THIS.
You know nothing. Guess again.
Dallis &lt;i&gt;takes&lt;/i&gt; power. &apos;Allowing&apos; doesn&apos;t enter into the equation.
*Do as he says - finish him off.*
We discovered the captain&apos;s log.
Well don&apos;t assume that you can drag me down with you.
*Warm your hands upon the flames.*
My master has lost interest in you... but I have not. Leave, my sweet. While you still can.
Medium Flame Rune Of Power
*Ask her if she&apos;s waiting for someone. Gareth, perhaps.*
Reckon I might&apos;ve had a harder time of it without your help, though. Bravery on the high seas is rewarded tenfold in the Hall, you know!
My old friend Callo told me that Roost expects me to deliver the Godwoken to a sawmill in the region.
Moo-moo!
Died. Died? But... but &lt;i&gt;how.&lt;/i&gt;
*Sigh.* I won&apos;t pretend to know why - the Divine answers to no-one. Either way, he seemed intent on sabotaging the path of his successors.
Lucian’s Crypt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Huwbert’s note here muses upon the nascent conflict between Paladins and Magisters, within the Divine Order, over the custody of Lucian’s mortal remains. To sum up - the Paladins gained custody of the body, but the Magisters gained a headquarters in Arx, site of the new Cathedral beneath which Lucian would be buried.]
We explored the Lizard Consulate, but found no survivors.
It-... it is &lt;i&gt;rotting.&lt;/i&gt; Almost imperceptibly, but it decays before my eyes. It must have no more than a century left!
Shield
The Stolen Passion of Lucian
I am &lt;i&gt;trying &lt;/i&gt;to discover if there is anyone worth saving.
Well, all the better. How&apos;d you like to make some coin?
That&apos;s it. Face my anger!

You wander where you don&apos;t belong. Let me show you the way out...
*Ceremony? Ask what he means.*
Ring Of Glory
Normally I&apos;d leave you to your delusions, but you and I have a mutual purpose. You can&apos;t hide your head in the clouds.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 2: The Birth of the Gods

*Ask the spirit who he is exactly.*
Wedding can&apos;t&apos;ve gone on after all this...
Let&apos;s cut to the chase, lizard. Your kind has built an empire on the backs of slaves, reaping the rewards of the innocents&apos; toil. &lt;i&gt;Do you condemn your kin?&lt;/i&gt;
Explore the lush oasis.
Speak to the spirits.
&apos;ey! Come on, you know this one, don&apos;tcha? &apos;Grab a bottle o&apos; air-oh...&apos;
If we kill Dorian instead, Micheil Ros will better his price.
Ya ever ache so much that even yer &lt;i&gt;hair&lt;/i&gt; hurts? Cuz let me tell ya, I&apos;m pretty sure even me toe-fuzz is burnin&apos;.
