*A skull-shaking roar makes you stagger, but the voice has no true power over you.*
*Tell her she&apos;s right. It&apos;s the fault of the thing inside you. You will see it destroyed even if it kills you.*
He ceased to be my King the moment he turned on me!
Gods, what a day.
*Next he leans over you, his hands travelling up along your inner thighs, his breath and his body hot along all your length.*
Your soul must grow bigger still; your inner self must become a vaster expanse so that it may house divinity.
What better way to spend Lucian&apos;s Day than drinking tea with friends?
Word of battle. Word of my Magister brothers and sisters. What can you tell me?
&lt;i&gt;And you? Will you struggle too? It makes no matter - you will all be One.&lt;/i&gt;
[IFAN] *Level with him. He needs to stop waiting for the dead Divine to solve his problems.*
*Tell him that Delorus left the Order and turned his hand to farming.*
More the fool me for placing my trust in a fool.
Magical Elven Bow
We play the fool among fools; the sage among sages. You&apos;ll find me somewhat more *ahem* coherent in privacy. That is a promise, prince.
*Lay your hand against the runes.*
It brought me ruin... Anyway, it all ends now. You see Alexandar, Divinity isn&apos;t the solution to the world&apos;s ills...
Reckon there&apos;s space for us in the Magisters&apos; barracks. Reimond ought not to turn down his own cousin!
The war with the demons gave him battles aplenty, and he relished them all.
*Agree. You&apos;d be happy to.*
We found the burial place of four heroes. Their valuables may be of use.
*For a brief moment you&apos;re looking through someone else&apos;s eyes - you see a giant statue&apos;s head and a gentle pool. In the vision you fall to your knees, screaming silently as you feel your soul drain away.*
Half-Rotten Zombie
Lord Vrogir: a champion of martial challenges. Less so of mental challenges...
No! Stop! The wolves! &lt;i&gt;The Lone Wolves!&lt;/i&gt; They may know about the Master!
Amadouvier
You! Over here - open this door!
Perhaps that&apos;s because she&apos;s Godwoken, just like you are. The fact that she&apos;s Godwoken is what&apos;s saving her, but may also be the very thing that spells the world&apos;s doom.
*Ask what happened at the consulate.*
I can&apos;t blame you for that. I won&apos;t forgive myself.
I know I can count on you, Sebille, you who loves her freedom above all! You must climb the temple to find the Mother&apos;s heart. And then you must destroy it.
Prudence
Toodle-oo, oafish creature.
Strapping armour for a strapping adventurer. Does it fit?
Use the [LeftStick] to move your cursor near or on an enemy, and press [IE_Interact] to perform the move or attack.
Basatan, the Wishmaster
Do not test me, Lohse! Do not! Be grateful for all that I&apos;ve given you, &lt;i&gt;and do not ask for more.&lt;/i&gt;
No more lies, Godwoken. No more treachery, no more death, no more betrayal.
I knew it the moment you walked in &apos;ere. &apos;&apos;ere comes an enterprising fellow,&apos; I said to meself. &apos;&apos;ere comes a man who could take a sum of gold and turn a tidy profit.&apos; I can see it in your eyes.
Wall
Alright, &lt;i&gt;luronta&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;m just about t&apos;speak a piece. Talk t&apos;me afterwards...
*Ask her about the lizard hanging at the gallows.*
*With a glint in her eye, she reaches into the folds of her dress, and pulls out a vial of the reddest blood. Your blood. She closes her eyes. Her lips begin to move, but you cannot hear her speak. Sweat breaks on your brow.*
Oh, and now that you&apos;re here, I wonder if you&apos;d be so kind as to assist me with yet another little matter...
*Ask about this cave. What happened there?*
The dead have come. Attack!
Yes. I see... &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; there. But it&apos;s not for me to say. I must get you to Malady. She will know.
*Say that you met someone in the Hall of Echoes...*
I, for one, would not weep if the Paladins left the Order entirely. I&apos;m so sick of their condescending stares and their obvious whispers. They see themselves as the Divine Order&apos;s spiritual arm - the clever ones, the devoted ones, the SUPERIOR ones. I may be a Magister, but I am no less a child of Divinity than those arrogant arse-cracks. I might be common - but I&apos;m not thick.
I pray you see them safe. I pray this in your name.
What... what will happen to us?
[DWARF] *Say there&apos;s no love lost between elves and dwarves.*
Which means they may still be open to a teaching position...
On your guard!
*Ask if she knows where, exactly, Atusa is meant to take them.*
*Shove past him. You&apos;ve business to attend to.*
Give
*Don&apos;t let him fade! Reach out and ensnare the ghost in your Source. Focus your mind on its past.*
Well, here&apos;s one corpse that never got a proper burial...
But we must first slay the dragon if we wish to get the gold, I suppose.
I packed my life up in a cloth...
The Magisters are dead.
Mad
Legends tell tales of the charging power of a stag being harnessed within just one arrow. Combining this arrowhead with an arrow shaft could let you discover whether those legends are true.
At a third altar I heard the voice once more. It was trying to tempt me. Yet again it bathed me in Source.
Cancel
You&apos;ve found a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Repair Hammer&lt;/font&gt;! Now you can press [IE_ContextMenu] on any broken equipment and select &apos;Repair&apos;.
*Nod. You understand not wanting to talk about the past.*
Get that artefact, and you and I are as good as free. Go give those lizards (ahem - pardon) what-for!
*Tell her you noticed she was in pretty bad shape on the island. You had expected the demon to make an appearance.*
Remove All
*The bitter air warms as you near the stone monument.*
So he&apos;s the one causing all this ruckus.
Add Folder
*The confusion in her eyes quickly turns to empty, desperate, desolate sadness. She bows her head, as if this is the end - the last shred of what she thought was real has now gone. She takes one last wander through her memories...*
Beach
*An emblem of the sun glows faintly on the altar, but all you can hear is the hiss and rumble of the volcano and your own heavy breath.*
Me too. A god I don&apos;t believe in told me things about myself I don&apos;t believe. Yeah.
Hmm. Let&apos;s see how quick I can be. Queen Justinia&apos;s ordered some dwarf named Lohar to ambush a ship called the Peacemaker and take its cargo. Whatever&apos;s on it, she&apos;s using it against the rebels. She calls it &apos;Operation Downfall&apos;. Pretty ominous, eh?
*Tell her she needs to find the rest of her people.*
Laser Ray
*Say she&apos;s fine for now, but she might not be if he doesn&apos;t tell you how to get out of here. &lt;i&gt;Now.*&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fool! You&apos;re wasting your time.&lt;/b&gt;
Nebora&apos;s Boots
Good. Very good. I&apos;m glad you&apos;re being so sensible. Glad I can return to my ruminations...
To pass the Path of Blood you must bypass the statue of Lucian. The Scroll of Atonement, when used with a Source amulet, will provide... an alternative route.
I&apos;ve been tasked with writing about the deeds of Rhalic - &lt;i&gt;First of the Seven!&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;ll wager my work will find more readers than the other six combined.
*The bard clears his throat and gargles on his own saliva. He then returns to his poem, but his voice cracks mid-verse.*
Character has changed appearance.
Looks like it could be pork meat... or is it wollock? Well, no matter; you&apos;ll die shortly after eating it either way.
EVEN IF I HOG ALL THE BLANKETS IN THE NIGHT AND AMN&apos;T EVEN SORRY?!
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there, shorty. Kari&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt she&apos;ll be caring much who or what she slices.
You&apos;ve received a new Talent: Spider&apos;s Kiss
*You feel your God thrashing against your control. &apos;Where...&apos; you croak in a voice not quite your own.*
PEEP! PEEP!
*Gareth freezes, then whips his head in your direction. That face? No longer unreadable, and red-hot. He rises up, imperious and indignant.*
[OUTLAW] *Someone who had an &lt;i&gt;empire&lt;/i&gt; to lose? Tell him you don&apos;t run with that kind of crowd.*
That you are. That you are.
There&apos;ll be a new Divine, but I know deep down and so do you - it won&apos;t be him.
and her loyalty was unquestionable.
It is no wonder it screams - the tree is barely more than carcass, blistered and charred. Its spirit wails into the ether, but I can&apos;t understand its words.
Cleave Percentage
*Tell him he doesn&apos;t know you at all.*
Did you really think that would be enough?
*She stands stiff and still as a board, stricken by your words.*
Blood Sucker Scroll
Apple Pie Dough
I&apos;m glad to have met you, my friend. You let me taste freedom, and now my journey is at an end. Go - meet your destiny.
*Remark that you hope she&apos;s reformed her ways, after winning back her freedom.*
[LOHSE] *Tell him your name is Lohse.*

But... who&apos;s to say that power wouldn&apos;t weaken me like it did Justinia? Would I be any better? Am I as... strong as my own stories say?
Its hunger is sated and it no longer poses a risk. There is no use slaying it now.
*Reply that the world is in grave danger, and those powers will enable you to save it.*
Gods preserve me - have you nothing better to do than pester me?!
You! A thief picks my pockets. I must see the contents of your bags.
*Give her a funny look. Isn&apos;t she supposed to be preparing for the Grand Rescue of her One True Love?*
*Scrabble back and try to run away.*
This won&apos;t be of any use.
*The Red Prince&apos;s spirit stands bewildered, his spectral eyes beleaguered by disbelief.*
Nah, it&apos;s nuffink like that. But hey... so...
Brahmos the Wanderer? He&apos;s a legend among us, isn&apos;t he?&lt;br&gt;
I mean... some of them might have made it, right? Maybe if we put an end to all this, we might meet them again.
*The hounds perk up and stare intently at the ball in your hand.*
Junan Zarkiller
*Dizziness. It lasts just a moment - but long enough for you to feel Zorl-Stissa&apos;s presence. You hear no words, yet understand: it&apos;s imperative you accept Ryker&apos;s bargain.*
If ye doubt Alexandar, pipsqueak, you haven&apos;t seen him or the Hammer in combat. They squash Sourcerers like the bugs they are - &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;are.
What? No, that can&apos;t be - I can&apos;t - ...hey, stop following me!
Ain&apos;t this creature&apos;s fault someone stole its mind. Poor thing.
So fret not, but revel in the promise of the lake! I will lead you there when you&apos;re ready: when you&apos;ve become a true Master of the Source, and speak the language of creation itself.
*Say that nobody sent you, and ask him if he&apos;s aware that he&apos;s dead.*
Farmyard 03
A bored &lt;i&gt;Meistr&lt;/i&gt;, prince. You will treat me with the respect I deserve!
A crocodilian ate the teleportation gloves, but they remain intact.
*Wait and let him finish.*
*He whistles up his Silent Watchers and advances upon you, deadly intent darkening his expression.*
I... But I don&apos;t know! How could I? The Master finds; he is never found. You must know that. Surely you know that!
