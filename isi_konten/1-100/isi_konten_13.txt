We wished for knowledge, and the Djinn gave us a skillbook.
*Tell the elf you&apos;ll go find this Doctor.*
I&apos;m very busy. The factory is crawling with Magisters and our shipments to Arx are held up. Time is money. Don&apos;t waste my money. What do you want?
This elf speaks truth. Boy, I&apos;ll let the rest of you live. But you&apos;re gonna do me a favour. You&apos;re going to tell your friends, and your neighbours, and every stranger you meet about this day.
In you I found a home better than the one I was pining for. Thank you, my love.
The damned old merchant was meant to name his daughter in his will, and then it would come to me. But no...
Please, my King, tell me what to do. Do not leave me in silence. Do not leave me behind!
*Claim your reward.*
*Tell the ship that it is to do as you command from now on.*
I&apos;m glad to see we&apos;re not the only ones trying to protect this town
So! To you! And your dwarf ma and your dwarf pa and all the rest!
Your fish stinks of the Void. What kind of rat would sell such filth?
*Tell him he&apos;s a fool - the man was no Sourcerer.*
I think my eyes deceive me, but no! That person I speak with - they teleport away from me!
[BARBARIAN] *Chuckle. It sounds like there&apos;s big power in that tiny package.*
Haven&apos;t heard that sweet song so clearly since I last saw Laslor. Pity the sweet has t&apos; be tainted by the bitter.
I surrendered Divinity to the God King.
The pirate boasted that his captain already came by to retrieve his treasure.
Mage&apos;s Leggings
*The creature clenches the plant tightly; his breath quickens. He seems liable to lunge at you at the drop of a pin.*
*Shake your head. That&apos;s not you at all.*
Cheers. Can I trouble you for just one more? Penny for a sick dog and so on?
I wouldn&apos;t go there if I were you. I work directly for Queen Justinia... and she doesn&apos;t take kindly to meddlers. And to be honest, I&apos;ve reached the end of my tether with what I can do here...
I found out where Dallis is heading. There&apos;s a great city not far from Driftwood - Arx, by name.  It&apos;s controlled by Magisters, so you&apos;ll have your work cut out for you. We have to find out what she&apos;s planning to do with the powers of the Seven.
*The dwarf stops mid-train of thought and stares at you. He seems to make a quick mental calculation...*
Heads or tails?
*The Magister silences the prisoner, turns to you, and holds out his hands, as if to say, &apos;Well, I tried my best!&apos; The hanging Sourcerer winks at you, and cuts through another strand of rope.*
*Inform him that the Empire is long-lived precisely because every kin understands their place.*
Jahan told Lohse that the demon he seeks is the one she hears in her head. Once we find this demon&apos;s name, he&apos;ll exorcise her.
*Tell him he can call you what he wants; your fate is your own.*
You can&apos;t get a free pass just cause you&apos;ve suffered. I feel for them, but to align with the Void is just plain wrong.
Now, let&apos;s get a move on while we can. I brought you something. A gift.
&apos;til next time, meatbag.
*The spirit lunges forward to nip at your ankle, to no effect.*
I knew you&apos;d be back for more...
He&apos;ll take me back. And I&apos;ll come for you again, and again, and again! You&apos;ll be mine yet. And then I&apos;ll be his only chosen, his blessed one...
Report to the Lone Wolves.
Erma! Erma?
*Something&apos;s off about this. Step away from the figurehead, and take your leave.*
Something isn&apos;t right. I think my helmet can tell when I&apos;ve consumed Source...
Milady honours me with her applause for my humble assessment.
Augmentor
*Tell her you&apos;re going to free the Meistr. Offer her ten gold coins to look the other way.*
*Roost turns his face toward you - and roughly wrenches the elf&apos;s jaw toward you as well.*
*Insist he wipe that sneer off his face and tell you what&apos;s really going on.*
Failure! Success impossible.
But Dallis has no more need of your service.
If I have to bet my money on the fellow who created all my kind, or some ancient unknowable... I know who I&apos;m picking.
It looked like they were working together. Like they were coordinated.
*Blithely poke the sword tip with your finger and pull an unimpressed face at the result. Tell him to go and sharpen his sword instead of bothering you - you&apos;re on the same side.*
Intelligent and curious, your appetite for learning far exceeds your taste for bloodshed. Books and scrolls are your dearest possessions.
*Smile and take his hand.*
Max. Quicksaves
*It turns away, uninterested once more.*
Hit_Melee_Std_6
I help with healing. Come if you wish.
*Ask for directions to the top floor. You have a date.*
Blindsider
A chance, yes. But it&apos;s much more than &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;
Good working with you, but you&apos;re not the one I joined up with. I&apos;ll talk with them directly, if you don&apos;t mind.
Curious response from the one who set me on this road. Curious and futile; you will die with the bishop you defend.
So, Lohse. Have you figured out what to do about your little parasite? You don&apos;t need me to remind you how important it is you don&apos;t let it fester.
HehehHEHEHEHEHHHHHhhhem. Ahem. OKAY!
You are right. I think it was her sickness. Now I know what this feeling means. The Mother is dead! We are finally free!
Stormbringer
Yes, well, I&apos;ll count that as a &apos;no&apos;, shall I?
As for myself, I perform the ancient rites of prayer and ceremony with a kind of languid indulgence.
I see the good in you, Sebille Kaleran. I would like to see the all of you. You are the new Mother. For the elves, you are the one last hope.
...or it may not. If the Gods do not choose you to progress, then you&apos;ll likely share my fate.
Dead Pillager
Young Han grew up a warrior and became one of the Alliance&apos;s greatest generals.
*The dwarf sways in front of you. His eyes are unfocused and he seems to be mumbling something to himself.*
*The spirit rises to his feet in surprise - but you&apos;re too fast for him.*
Dallis used a living scar to steer the Lady Vengeance - perhaps we can too.
You are not the One. Pity.
*A breathless and only marginally fantastical description of a flying insectile Voidwoken.*
Arhu seems to have an association with cats.
Ah-ah. Easy.
Find out what happened on the shipwreck.
*Beast&apos;s spirit doesn&apos;t acknowledge you as you approach. He only sings - slowly, achingly, sadly.*
Red Prince, Spouse of the Sun, &lt;i&gt;Anan Erchet!&lt;/i&gt; I was keeping the portal at the consulate open for you, but, but...
Keep yourself out of trouble, sister.
I have all the evidence I need to prove Queen Justinia is plotting against the Magisters! All we need to do now is take care of the pup she sent to play: Lohar.
A deserved bit of sarcasm I suppose. But though this Stingtail fellow may be a less than stellar specimen in the firmament of Dreamers, the dreams themselves proved to be quite elucidating.
*It hurts. It hurts as he tears at your flesh. It hurts as he eats his way to your heart and then swallows it down.*
*The Doctor looks at you in shock. The word seems to hurt him. He hisses in anger...*
Rumour has it that Lord Kemm himself was in league with the Black Ring. The late Lord Kemm, that is.
The imperial consulate lies in ruins. If there are survivors, I need their help.
*Choose this tea.*
A fine vessel you have here, Sourcerer. I hope you&apos;ll use it to get us far away from this place. Freedom can&apos;t come soon enough.
Recurve Crossbow
*His laugh is thin and papery, like dead leaves falling upon a winter grave.*
Arhu&apos;s spirit has been extinguished, along with any remaining information he could offer.
Abominations. Once Sourcerers like us - but not so lucky. Magisters found some way to turn &apos;em into living weapons against us. Don&apos;t ask me how, I&apos;ve nightmares enough already.
Swornbreaker Schematic
*The bitter air warms as you near the stone monument.*
*Tell him you can&apos;t afford his fee.*
I owe you. Whole realm owes you, really, but I&apos;ll do my best to settle that debt myself.
Are you sure?
Any questions? No? Good.
the Beast and the Lady Vengeance sailed on.
Captain&apos;s Cabin
Hmm. And what about that collar, then? All part of your master plan, is it?
*The elf points to a crumpled note on the table.*
Didn&apos;t you hear me the first time? Keep outta my &apos;air, lanky!
Do you like my new form? It serves its purpose. It allows me to speak to you. And it allows me to think. At last I see clearly. I know what must be done.
*Frown. Isn&apos;t he supposed to be dead?*
*Snore* Whassut that noise..?
[LOHSE] *Consider your companion. Seems nice, but they&apos;re probably better off without you.*
Redbrand Brute
*Consume the shark-spirit&apos;s Source.*
I&apos;m telling you, I don&apos;t...
*Insist she&apos;d have to tell you where her creation is.*
We were unable to create a working story. Your main adventure might be invalid. The game will continue with the story from the savegame.
The Adventurer&apos;s Field Guide&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I&apos;m not a lumberjack, but I can get a good strong stick out of any log with my trusty axe whenever I&apos;m in need of one. Some weird geezers have been asking for the wood chips on the floor after I&apos;ve chopped up some logs, and I just let them. I have no idea what to do with those.
But the great Mother Tree spoke of death and domination. I hated her, fled from her - only to end in a strange land among unkind strangers. First there was Roost, then... the &lt;i&gt;Master&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell him the groom won&apos;t be causing him any more trouble.*
I don&apos;t find anything I shouldn&apos;t find in here.
Inert Elven Wand
*The statue is a striking sight - a sizzling blue totem on a blood-red isle.*
Lookin&apos; a little tight around the neck. Won&apos;t you let me help you?
The Magisters are dead. You have my thanks. You know your trade.
Grenade Posion Cloud
*Accept the offer.*
You should be proud my father picked you - his best right-hand man. He knew you would make it. But he also knew that if he told you the truth, you would falter. He knew you well, Ifan.
Well, that was easy.
*Shrug non-committally.*
Be sure to close the doors behind you as you leave.
All aboard! The bell is ringing and we&apos;re ready to depart! Get in the boat, I mean to say.
[LOHSE] *Tell them neither of them are right. Love is... something else.*

Click on an enemy to attack it. Remember: any action you perform, including movement, costs Action Points (AP).
*Walk over the dragon with the intent of taking it with you.*
Thief! Mother, there&apos;s a thief!
What have I done, what have I done!
*She cocks her skull to one side with a nightmarish creak. Though her shiny visage is completely devoid of emotion, you sense confusion in her manner. Confusion, and more than a little scorn.*
You have to help her. &lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm... good.
You forget yourself. I hope you will remember soon.
None
