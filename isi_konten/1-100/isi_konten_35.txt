[UNDEAD] *Stare into her mask. Something about the way she said the person she was is &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt;...*
Don&apos;t worry. Lucian will reward your faith and heal you.
Electric Frog
When he comes out, lads, kill him.
I help you to know and understand.
*The enormous, unusually-red troll looms over you with his fists clenched threateningly. His expression is stern, yet you can see the tiniest twinkle in his intelligent eyes.*
*Write &apos;Divine&apos;.*
*As the Source flows into your bones, you feel a sudden gloom. Your helmet starts to twist and warp. Darkness pours from it, and a demon steps out from your shadow.*
Amadia&apos;s Scribe
*Scoff and say that from the looks of him he&apos;s spent more time with the pipe than in prayers.*
Yes. I was careless. And I&apos;ve suffered for it. The isle has suffered. But you can end it.
Ha! Well, keep those wits of yours around me too then.
But, they made their choices. And I made mine...
Go on. Scoot.

Stone Hatch
*Looking at the complex contraptions in front of her, ask what she is doing here.*
I don&apos;t wanna die here! Or anywhere!
I&apos;ll support &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Let&apos;s go.
Alas, they lose themselves to ancient worlds...
*As you pluck the short straw from his hands, Kinnet weeps with relief. His wound disappears in turn and he is restored to the model image of a strapping young soldier.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll first need to get out of this place; then you&apos;ll decide where to go.*
*Say there&apos;s a felled tree north of here: why should you pay to cross the bridge when you can cross that for free?*
Fulfill your destiny and take root.
What they did deserved a lot worse than what they got. This lot were Sourcerer sympathisers. Good Magisters died thanks to the one they were hiding.

Don&apos;t be too hasty, friend - won&apos;t you at least listen to me before you draw your weapon...?
*You try to grip her hand, but your own passes straight through it.*
What say you?
That&apos;s as may be. She could have had &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; life too.
Yes. Finally, progress. It&apos;s odd, you know. I can feel that it knows I know. I feel this kind of... rage. And terror. But I know it&apos;s not &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;, too.
*One Sourcerer to another, wonder what Ifan thinks of the Divine Order.*
*He glances up at you - big, empty eye sockets taking in every detail.*
Wine
*Say it&apos;s been absolutely riveting, but that you have to dash.*
Saheila herself led the elves out of Rivellon. The time had come for her people to set down their roots elsewhere.
So I was, but what have I to show for my efforts?
&lt;i&gt;*Beeeeuuuwww.&lt;/i&gt; SLEEPY TIME.*
No sign of him. Stay vigilant.
Do it for decency. He&apos;s a weeping wound. A scab. A crusted boil. MEND IT!
And all the precocious little mortals I&apos;ve met along the way... well, their mayfly lives were always going to be snuffed out sooner or later.
Skeleton
Miss!
Jewellery Box
Your eyes. They swirl and swirrrl and swirrrrrl inward. How deep do they go?
You&apos;ve earned your fate, conspirators!
Oil Splatter
Let&apos;s not be hasty, Magister. This ought to be an education for all of us.
Not my eggs, our eggs! All the family, all the eggs, every last one! Big Marge saw. Big Marge is dead. We&apos;ll never find them, never ever...
Last chance to get out of this with your face intact, friend. Open the bag.
*Say you don&apos;t blame him for losing his temper in this wretched place.*
Wrath and terror. We displeased the king. The truth we spoke. His fortune told. No divinity would he be.
Slumberjack
I don&apos;t know what that means, but it sounds pretty neat!
*Ask Sebille why she kills her chosen targets with a needle. Why not use a sword or a dagger?*
*The Sourcerer waves goodbye, and you note the rope burns on his wrist from where he&apos;d been bound and hanged - his skin as red as your own.*
Malady is ready to leave. She awaits our word.
Mature in my powers at last, the Nameless Isle awaited me. There I would prove my worth at the Council of Seven and become champion of the Gods in the war with the Void.
[HUMAN] *Gesture at the Paladin. Was that to be humanity&apos;s place in this?*&lt;br&gt;
The sooner I am off this carved monstrosity, the better.
Open your eyes, little snake. Time to die.
A handful of sharp iron nails. Closer examination reveals it would be a sin to waste them.
*She stares at the empty spot on her palm for a long moment before turning back to you, continuing as if nothing had happened.*
I see you and I fear you not. Injured I may be, do not take me for vulnerable.
*A lizard stares at you with open delight. His torn garb resembles that of a priest.*
*You&apos;ve killed more Voidwoken than you can count to get here. You&apos;re not turning back now.*
Lord Raizlo Auldritch &apos;The Hasty&apos;
My thoughts exactly. Curious, how Dallis would seek to learn such things, don&apos;t you think? Perhaps she left something behind to point to her intentions...

*Ignoring his question, admire the Magister&apos;s battle bravery.*
This was my father&apos;s house.
&lt;i&gt;*Buuuuzzzzzt. &lt;/i&gt;HELLO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?*
Unable to join game: Loading in progress
All Magister readin&apos; material hasta go. Orders from Lord Kemm.
*Ask her what she&apos;s doing.*
Wits
*As the last of its rage and hatred leaves you, a bright light pierces your vision. Behind your eyelids, a scene materialises.*
Well, I can&apos;t find anything unusual. Sorry for the trouble.
But I saw the shinies. Four of them. Round. Darkness left, then light again. Warm. Saw glints in sand and dirt.
Explosion
I am Xhaxh! The light may not illuminate me, yet in darkness I cannot hide!
Deaf
*Lie and say you agree to his terms.*
[IFAN] *Incline your head. Ifan ben-Mezd.*
Dammit. Dammit all to hell. Just kids, both of &apos;em.
Welcome, my dear Beast, I&apos;m glad you could come. You seem to have traversed the Deathfog just fine. So tell me, what ails you?
Magical Two-Handed Lizard&apos;s Axe

*He&apos;s chased to an office. To a vault. Guards are posted as he cowers inside and you wait for word from Driftwood. But the words you hear aren&apos;t the words you expected.*
If we should perish, we&apos;ll face the great unknown &lt;i&gt;together!&lt;/i&gt;
You must be the Red Prince. I did meet with a Brahmos, yes, but he&apos;s no longer here.
Tir-Cendelius
Halt! You&apos;ve been hanging around where you&apos;re not wanted. Only place you belong is a prison cell.
You can figure this out, come on...
*Your mind is vast and open; your body feels renewed, scrubbed clean.*
*Stay silent and wait for him to continue.*
*Say you saw him murder that lizard in cold blood.*
You are the real hero here, Simone.
Damage
*The White Magister swiftly pivots towards you and draws his blade. You recognise his face at once: He&apos;s Gareth&apos;s friend Jonathan.*
*The Silent Monk leans forward slightly and stares at you straight in the eyes. She seems eager for you to say something.*
Make it stop!
*The cat and the dog still appear to be arguing.*
I had sympathy at first! A mum callin&apos; after her dead child&apos;s a sad sight. But even sympathy has its limits.
Air Totem
A collared Sourcerer? What are they doing-
*...as she finds the rhythm of the song that only she can hear... but as she sways and moves, with elegance and grace, at once beguiling and raw with pure emotion...*
Log
Dogsbody &apos;ere thinks that &apos;cos the master is grateful for &apos;is - meaning the dog&apos;s - mindless devotion, &apos;e loves &apos;is dog more than &apos;e loves &apos;is cat.
Looks like I need to teach you a lesson, thief!
Ah. Hello. I see you come a long way. I see you come here seeking a great adventure. Do you find it?
Fleeing pursuers, Brahmos the Wanderer took refuge in a nearby paladin camp.
*Tear a page from your journal and write a letter to Hardwin. Tell him what you learned of the White Magisters&apos; activities in the Blackpits. Then raise the whistle to your lips... and blow.*
&lt;i&gt;I KIIIIIIIILL YOU, DEAD-MEAT!&lt;/i&gt;
Empty Cup
It&apos;s been making the lupine rounds for a while now.
But not lost to Fane.
As it stands, he&apos;d overpower you in the blink of an eye. But I&apos;ve found a way we can weaken him. &lt;i&gt;Significantly.&lt;/i&gt;
*Beast looks to the ground, then to you. And again: the ground, then you. And then once more, until he gets the point - and a most hearty laugh shakes the whole of his body.*
Summon becomes immune to Poison damage and gains an additional Geomancer skill (depending on summon).
World&apos;s End
You know about that, do yeh? Well before you go blood-crazed, you should know the queen&apos;s no friend of mine. Not no more.
*He&apos;s fast. Damn, he&apos;s fast. He knew you&apos;d make that move: dodges it and slaps you on the back of the head with a wicked cackle.*
The Archeologist&apos;s spirit asked us to take him to his place of longing: an excavation site near Stonegarden.
Very well! My child will skip the cradle for combat. I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way, really.
*The scene twists again. Now Braccus stands before you, a beautiful woman at his side. You lash out in treasonous rage, but cold arms bind you. You&apos;re sealed away in a tower. Your screams fill the darkness.*
Dost thou not see I am pouting? I shan&apos;t allow a single guard to witness me in such a state.
So, you&apos;re it? Our new Divine.
Hey! You&apos;re here! Pretty nice boat, eh? We got an upgrade.
*Tell the child you&apos;ll keep an eye on her.*
*The wolf is hungry. He has waited a long time for this. Allow Ifan his vengeance.*

What? Nonsense, prince. It cannot be.
Forest - Quiet Path
Sir, please wait!
*Hold him back.*
Oh, please. I&apos;ve heard it all a million times before. You&apos;re under arrest!
*Remark that there&apos;s only so many possible combinations - with enough patience, the lock would be cracked eventually.*
Find the hovering runes.
Your punishment was fitting to your crime. But your crime could be forgiven.
*Assure the spirit that you&apos;ll figure out what to do, but he has to let you into her cell first.*
You are about to leave for a higher level area. If you have unfinished business in Fort Joy, you should take care of it before venturing forth. Are you ready to leave?
The Imperial Guard forced itself into my chambers and found me with the succubus still on top of me.
No... Such is but a different truth... Even here I hear the voices of destiny whisper...
*Tell her it isn&apos;t a good idea; she seems to be doing alright and she shouldn&apos;t risk making it worse.*
