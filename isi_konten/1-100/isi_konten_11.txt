Let me heal you... Let me shield you... Until you find me...
Good wishes, my colourful friend.
There&apos;s nothing interesting down there. The future lies above - not below.
*The two men embrace amicably enough, but you sense an uneasy tension running beneath their smiles.*
It is the greatest ambition. We shall imbue the champion with power beyond comprehension!&lt;br&gt;
I feel like I can take on the world. As for Dallis? &lt;i&gt;Bring it on.&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm. I think I can relate to your sentiment, madam...
*Ask him if he&apos;s referring to THE Hammer, the right hand of Bishop Alexandar.*
Apple Juice
Now, now. I insist. What do you know?
*She&apos;s right - you don&apos;t like the way your God has been acting. Denounce Zorl-Stissa.*
*The captain tries to angle the blade of his sword to catch a glimpse of his injuries in its reflection. He winches at the damage, before seeing you approach.*

*Say she looks a little... deceased... to be a Seeker.*
Unique
Watch yourself, reptile. Plenty of folks &apos;round here&apos;d happily burn a lizard.
Damage and maximum Vitality is decreased. Cured by Fortify, Bless, First Aid.
*Say you&apos;re on a mission for the Sallow Man...*
*Hum low under your breath, keeping Zorl-Stissa&apos;s song from entering your consciousness.*
Beasts, spectres, bones... even Voidwoken sometimes. Seen things in here I&apos;ve never even read about in fairy tales. Even saw a winter dragon once! But I make sure nobody sees me.
Too many Paladins from noble families and too many Magisters that started as working folk.
Lucian the Warbringer
Bleedin&apos; zealots. These humans&apos;ll be the death of us! If the Voidwoken don&apos;t beat &apos;em to it.
You looking to meet a Voidwoken, are you? You must have a high opinion of yourself in a fight, or you wouldn&apos;t be so eager.
*An ancient, echoing voice rises from within the totem.*
*Shake your head. That&apos;s definitely it.*
No! The door!
I was on my way to... where I thought that I might find... a friend - of whom I&apos;ll say no more. The Magisters trapped me. And it appears I &lt;i&gt;did &lt;/i&gt;find a friend. *Smiles...* Just not the one I&apos;d expected.
*Shrug. Doesn&apos;t sound like your cup of tea.*
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll chew the beating heart from you.&lt;/i&gt;
Ring Helm
There&apos;s also another lady on my mind, of course. Justinia. A reckoning&apos;s comin&apos; for her. And its name is Beast.
Now be on your damn way! I have work to do.
*Tell him you might be able to stop all of this - the Voidwoken, Fort Joy - but not yet. You need information first.*
You. You there. You&apos;ve just arrived, isn&apos;t that right? Are you - *whispers* - are you quite alone?
*Take your leave.*
You anticipate me most accurately, Your Highness.
If I could fill my bowl with &apos;sorries&apos; I&apos;d be a very fat elf! Good day to &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; madam.
But with the Reds slain and the Whites ousted, maybe now we can restore the Divine Order to its former glory...
What do you want, lizard? You can&apos;t just come in here as you please - there&apos;s Magisters missing; I&apos;m trying to conduct a bloody investigation!
Might! Yes!
Iâ€™m going to kill her.
*The skeleton shrugs, turns on his heel, and walks away.*
Strong String
Do you ever wonder if your lizard empire still stands?
Lies, lies, and more lies! Now face your death!
*Warn him to toe the line - there&apos;s a new boss coming and there will be changes...*
Royal Dwarven Axe
Don&apos;t fiddle with the rat. And &lt;i&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; make me say it twice.
*Thank her in turn. You wouldn&apos;t have made it without her.*
Balanced Two-Handed Axe
&lt;i&gt;Agggh&lt;/i&gt;... just go, damn you...

*Sympathise, telling him that she must have been an amazing person.*
Search Maps
*Tell him you came across such an elf on your way in. She was merely wounded.*
*Her darkened eyes scour your body with an uncanny intensity.*
Two-Handed Dwarven Axe
Talk to Griff about escape.
She is &lt;i&gt;mine.&lt;/i&gt; Do you wish to join her?&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
*Nod and tell the kid that, as it happens, Ifan&apos;s your travelling companion.*
Fear has gripped this character. It cannot be controlled and will automatically try to run away.
He can&apos;t be! I&apos;ve seen him before around here - he wouldn&apos;t be capable. Three Magisters can&apos;t have been taken by some bloody wandering tinkerer!
*She begins to melt away before your eyes, disappearing with each step like smoke on the breeze until there&apos;s nothing left.*
[MYSTIC] *Tell her to be prudent. The Meistr is a powerful spirit. If she dies here, she may linger even in the afterlife.*
Of course not, my child. And you will feel whole again - I will help you. But first you must return to the world and escape from that island.
Effie&apos;s Emporium
*Say your long-held belief that the Divine Order are a bunch of thugs certainly proved true.*
Dreamer Pipe
You&apos;re safe among friends. Never forget it.
*Tell him to report in.*
Is that so? You droop like a dying willow and simper like a newborn vole. The spirit of the One requires an undaunted host.
Soggy Note

Dungeon - Underground Apartments A
Adramahlihk is bonded to his Godwoken ally. As long as his ally lives, Adramahlihk cannot die.
Never you mind what it&apos;s worth! It&apos;s your bloody civic duty! If you know anything, spit it out. Otherwise, clear off!
Lumberjack&apos;s Axe
Voidwoken Guardian
Yes, I was wrong. Yes, I was weak. But I&apos;ll never apologise for putting the kingdom above all else. If it is to survive, then its enemies must be vanquished.
Shriekers. The Black Ring brute spoke the truth.
Good spot to ground ships from, I&apos;ll tell you that much. The Reds never see it coming.
But the Mother has a secret weapon.
Children playing with toys. Braccus used those weapons a thousand years ago and did not understand their power. These red brats are no different.
My offspring of dragons: I will see them born!
I managed to free myself - along with a number of Seekers - from the Magisters. We&apos;ve captured the Lady Vengeance and can take our leave from this wretched isle very soon. But first, there&apos;s something I need to know.
You fought your way through hell to spare Rivellon the same fate. Be proud of that.
HAIL, MAKER, FULL OF GRACE.
Can&apos;t find anything strange in here. Sorry for the intrusion.
*She buries her head in her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.*
*Shrug casually and draw your weapon. This should be fun.*
&lt;i&gt;Go away.&lt;/i&gt;
*Spit out a single word - &apos;Magisters&apos;.*
Oh baby. Oh darling. I feel so GOOD. Come to me...
Whatever they wanted, they won&apos;t be gettin&apos; now. Good riddance to &apos;em.
Witch&apos;s Potion Notes
Buy Back
But the thing is, I don&apos;t really care whether or not I&apos;ve got the right guy. If I haven&apos;t got him, I will eventually. Meantime, I&apos;m happy to amuse myself with someone else&apos;s blood.
Sixth Sense
How amusing. I admit I had not seen that twist coming. I was certain the pitiful begging was about to begin.
*The skeleton&apos;s jaw shifts into what you think &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;be a grin.*
*Tell her Lohar is a... friend. She&apos;d do well to leave you be.*
Airborne Plague
Made of simple leather, this unremarkable belt will at least keep your pants where they ought to be.
*You hear the howl of the fog as it travels the pipe toward the sea...*
*She gives you a long, assessing look, but makes no immediate comment.*

How many apples does Jack have left?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answer: ____
I&apos;d expect nothing less.
So this is it. The Anchorets are at an end. My father, and my brother, and now myself, brought down by the Order.
*Tatcher shrugs.*
Good. It is proper that the Godwoken should seek combat. Too many take fright. They do not survive the trials ahead.
*Knock the lizard&apos;s hand away - what the hell is he doing?!*
I&apos;ve been workin&apos; for the dwarves for nigh seven years. They&apos;d not get rid of me now, surely?
I lived for that day, Godwoken. The flesh of every Magister, melted like butter in the sun - the Paladins&apos; eyes bugged out in horror as they watched their spouses and children choke on the Deathfog clogging their lungs. There would be screams, first. Then silence.
*Vein depleted*
Nothing... to... see... here. Mmmmm? Please... move... along.
Nothing in life is free, I suppose. Make sure you &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;jump them, Lohse. You won&apos;t be sorry.
Rotten Arm
*Let her know you found a cache of Source weapons hidden in the fish factory.*
*The spirit glances around again.*
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go on, then. Whyn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;give it a shot.
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
You disappear as I speak to you...? Such rudeness!
&apos;Here lies an unnamed child,&lt;br&gt;of the Harkwood family.&lt;br&gt;Their sorrows know no bounds.&apos;
*The spirit of a Magister lingers nearby, scowling at the damage that&apos;s been dealt to the premises.*
Bandit Rogue
My time is precious. Be mindful how you waste it.
That&apos;s it - put &apos;em up, y&apos;goon!
Yes - yes. I see the honesty in your eyes. This news does muddle things a tad...
Decomposing Axeman
You &lt;i&gt;must not&lt;/i&gt; disturb us, no matter what. Promise me.
Corrosive resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
A spear from a bygone age, encrusted with the long-dried blood of Lord Withermoore.
But Mord&apos;Akaim is so much more than the power to have those beasts slaughter each other.
Murga
*Keep smiling. &lt;i&gt;Wider.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him Almira will permit you to help him - you&apos;ll kill the Divine Order scum.*
You clearly have a death wish!
Include Extras
...does not deserve the faintest breath of praise.
Even cliffs have their breaking point against the sea. This was a frightful experience.
Clothes Equip
Yes, I had best leave too. I&apos;ll come back for Marie, but I don&apos;t want to be here when this mess is discovered.
*Ask her how many beings she&apos;s hosting at the moment.*
This is how they work: Divide us, then conquer us one by one. I won&apos;t have it. Family&apos;s family.
The spirit of Vilnx Creeva is no more.
He&apos;s... he&apos;s just a child...
Braccus Rex
He and his circus have claimed the top level of my temple.
Do not resist me. Perhaps I&apos;ll let you live, and bear witness to the return of Divinity - quite the privilege...
Anyhoo. Outta here with ya, eh? You done yer work.
Would you look at that? Looking out for number one. I like that in a woman.
&lt;i&gt;We had us a cruise and six days in the sun&lt;br&gt;But grave duty calls, so I have to run!&lt;br&gt;Too dangerous, my charge, for you, dear old boy,&lt;br&gt;Best you stay here in jolly Fort Joy!&lt;/i&gt;
If you&apos;re not here to talk about my art, I&apos;m not interested.
Deer
But hey. You make good fumblin&apos; company.
Perform the Godwoken ritual once more.
*The man in the painting is silent and still.*
May the Divine smile upon you, stranger.
*Ask Ifan how he feels about Lucian&apos;s betrayal.*
*Snap that they&apos;re fighting for survival. Waiting here for death would be foolish.*
I grew weary, I was bleeding; in pain, and how I gasped when for the first time an animal eyed me with malice and &lt;i&gt;growled.&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
If you&apos;re looking for Cat, she&apos;s... she&apos;s &lt;i&gt;evaluating&lt;/i&gt; all of Kemm&apos;s antiquities. It&apos;ll - uh - it&apos;ll be a while. But hey, why not do some shopping while you wait? You&apos;ll love what I&apos;ve got!
*The Black Ring captain gingerly dabs a rag at the secretions from his socket, growling with pain. He sees you approach...*
