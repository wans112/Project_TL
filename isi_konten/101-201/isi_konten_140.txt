*The warrior drops to his knees behind you, a smouldering hole torn right through his torso. He pitches forward onto his face.*
Of course you do, Godwoken. Why else would you seek out a tired old spectre like myself?
You may proceed into the temple, but I pray the other Godwoken have more stomach than you.

*Say you had expected something different - sudden realisations about existence, about people, the power to create in the blink of an eye.*
I see you gallivanting around. And now it&apos;s time to gallivant your way out of here.
*Tell him you have no quarrel with him. He should go his way, and you will go yours.*
*Your surroundings somersault around you. You find yourself lying on your side... gazing up at the curious sight of your own decapitated body teetering off its knees to the floor...*

The Beast of the Sea returned to the dwarven kingdom, this time as a lawmaker. After a very public blunder, Marcus eschewed political power and returned to the sea. The Beast and the Lady Vengeance sail on.

I don&apos;t care if the Seven themselves floated down to Rivellon and presented you a gold-threaded invitation - &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am the authority here.

Letter from Windego
We met Gareth settling old scores with a Magister he knew when he was younger. We helped him as best we could.
*A mix of sweat and blood smears across Gareth&apos;s forehead. He offers nothing but his silent ire.*
Well. Will you look at that?
You see, once upon a bad old time, a lizard cut this thing, this &lt;i&gt;living scar&lt;/i&gt; into my cheek: the mark of a slave.
I work for the Doctor. There&apos;s no condition he can&apos;t prevent... or cure.

For one thousand years I&apos;ve listened to talk. Nay, flesh, it is time for action!
Another, so soon? Easy, or you&apos;ll end up like Safa there. Take it from me: A little abstinence and chastity will do you good. Such is the Divine&apos;s will.
Don&apos;t think so. You broke the rules by coming down here, buck. Divine&apos;s rules.
You do well, Sebille, in memory of Saheila. Now you must fight for all elves. Go to the Nameless Isle. The Mother Tree needs you.
We healed Matis.
No! Please!
I. Am no. Mistake. Mistake was theirs. I cannot be held responsible for a mistake I did not make. The mistake was theirs and they make it still. You see...

If I can&apos;t get this thing out of me, then I&apos;ll need to become so powerful it won&apos;t be able to control me ever again.
*Pull your fingers back from the tablet&apos;s surface.*
MA!
It was all a bit ominous, wasn&apos;t it? With the Divine dead and divinity itself dying, it seems we have no choice but to venture forth and, for lack of a better phrase, save the world.
Escape the war-torn desert.
Magister Carver and Wyvlia the cook are both dead. The matter is resolved.
This is Mihaly. We absconded together... I from the Black Ring, and he from the Magisters. We fell for each other while I was his prisoner. *Smiles.* Love will set you free.

The Seekers - what&apos;s left of them, at least - have been quite busy with the effort. One incinerated himself on the figurehead, and the others have been stymied by a set of doors downstairs.
Thanks, missus! I&apos;ll go find my mum now. And I won&apos;t trust anyone!

To pass the Path of Blood, we must place the charged Source amulet in a mechanism on a pillar to the left of the chamber with Lucian&apos;s statue, then read the Scroll of Atonement.
Curse you! If the Master taught you... if he taught you all... No! Stay back! I will speak.
We persuaded Buttons to let us help the little girl.
*Tell her you&apos;re going to be Divine. Staying with you now means staying on the right side of history.*
A sagacious decision.

Patty Cake, Patty Cake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone knows how to bake bread. Go to the shop, get flour and water, and you&apos;re almost there. But out in the wild, you make your own flour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;ll be carrying a watermill around, so just make the best of it with a mortar and pestle and some wheat.
You&apos;ve got a lot going on, Godwoken, so I won&apos;t take up your time, and you shouldn&apos;t take up mine.
Malady lived up to her name. Whatever she did for &apos;us,&apos; I&apos;m sure she had an ulterior motive.
*Pull out the Purging Wand that you found. You think it could help, if it worked...*
I never thought I&apos;d see ol&apos; Dain up &apos;n&apos; fit as a fox again! Haven&apos;t seen a man closer to the Hall in all my days. A right miracle, it is. Maybe I ought to study a bit o&apos; magic myself... once I&apos;m out of here, that is.
I&apos;m impressed by your bravery, though you shall never be as great as I, Murina the Brave!
Are you sure? Look deeper, Lohse. Beyond our face.

I am consort to Her Royal Highness Justinia. It is my business to know who serves the queen&apos;s allies and abets her enemies. You do not roam this land unnoticed - and your true form is hardly hidden to all.
Unless I&apos;m quite mistaken (in which case I once more apologise profusely) you&apos;ll most likely find milord in the immediate vicinity of the Magister Headquarters - the Magisters, in case my previous sentence lacked clarity, being the firebrands I alluded to.

I can give you a greater understanding of your Source. I can increase your powers. I can show you how to take the Source from the world around you - from the animal world, the creatures of the forest.
*Kari&apos;s spirit waits quietly and patiently for a release that may not come, and she may not deserve.*

We visited Daeva, the arch-demon Doctor. He offered his help with my quest for Divinity, but I refused and defeated him.

The Eternals have been reduced to &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt; And yet, could I trade the Source of all the people I have met, just to see them return to their arrogance?

As for me... the Godwoken&apos;s sacrifice severed the link that bound the Sworn to the God King, and I was finally free. To atone for my sins I spent the rest of my days taking care of the sick and elderly, telling the story of the Godwoken, that the world may never forget the greatest heroes Rivellon had ever seen.

But Alexandar bears no rivals. Only the son can follow the father, or so he is convinced. For him: divinity. For the others: the dungeons.
