Marcus is dead. I am the Beast o&apos; the Sea. &lt;i&gt;And you will address me as such.&lt;/i&gt;
That&apos;s why I said it.
*Where your feet should be, you see great, gnarled roots disappearing into a mossy forest floor. As this log once was, you are an Ancestor Tree.*
P-PEEP!
Call down an oil rain, that sets Oiled on all characters and produces Oil puddles.
An idiot replaced by a maniac? And people allow this?
This book details how to create a razzle-dazzle grenade using nothing but a jellyroom or an air resistance potion. Of course, it could go off at any stage and dazzle its creator, but you record this in your recipe book anyway. After all, this one it looks so easy you could do it with your eyes closed.
A rare breed of plant that is often seen as a harbinger of doom for others, though it can survive all types of weather itself. Cultivated as a household shrub by the fearless.
Linder Kemm&apos;s Mansion
Far be it from me not to oblige.
Dead Black Ring Fighter
*And when will that be? Or where? You have questions about what&apos;s ahead.*
Raises Skeleton Archer
Fight on without me! The Devourer&apos;s victory spells doom for us all.
*Say you have killed.*
Force of habit.
We smashed Captain Zapor&apos;s Soul Jar. The essence inside seemed enraged.
*Jahan steps away and Lohse tumbles to the ground before quickly scrambling to her feet.*
*Massive claws run up your spine and grip the back of your neck. With the squeeze, a sculpted rune appears in your hands.*
And an effective one, too! Lohar&apos;s dwarves light it,  ship captains follow it, and sploosh! The cargo spilled all over the rocks, ripe for pickin&apos;.
Gold? I- I don&apos;t have any gold.
*Scoff. You don&apos;t have time for this.*
Soon as I&apos;m able, I&apos;ll be out of here to track down Gareth. There&apos;s no time to waste!
Prison Cell
*Ask him if he won whatever fight he was just in.*
*Han hammers at the air with his fist in solidarity.*
One of the others sent you, eh? Sent you to pester a poor man that has lost his sight?
Black... Black Ring? Isbeil, I demand an explanation!
[SCHOLAR] *Actually you think you did read something about a lizard named Rask in the old histories...*
A masked chainmail helmet of standard craftsmanship.
*Ask if he ever gets lonely on the road.*
Set Vampiric Hunger on every ally around you, adding [1]% Life Steal. Life Steal heals you in proportion to the damage you deal to Vitality.
*The tree-form spirit slowly, painfully, becomes aware of you... then with a heavy, painful creak returns to its slumber.*
*The God bursts into yellow flame, searing its way through the log. Vrogir transforms again, standing before you in his true orcish form, before snorting in derision and walking away.*
Who else? Who else but your god would have seen something worth saving in you?
Didn&apos;t have the nerve, huh? Thought as much.
The Dreamer
*Tell him there are horses and a waiter in it too, if he&apos;ll be patient.*
*Beast flashes a relieved grin, and absentmindedly begins to twist three strands of beard hair into a braid.*
The Void is coming for us. And we thought Magisters were bad news.
*Place an ear against the wagon. After all, it&apos;s only right that you should make absolutely certain all is well.*
I... I swear, I don&apos;t know. Maybe he went to his house? It&apos;s over by the barracks! Just don&apos;t hurt me...
*Take her hands in yours and say you&apos;ve heard the prophecies. It&apos;ll be an honour indeed to enact the return of dragons with her.*
*Tell Gareth you&apos;ll take any help you can get. Especially if it means getting off this island.*
Now. Make yourself comfortable. The harder you fight, the harder the experiment will be on you.
There&apos;ll be a wedding in full-swing by the time you arrive. A gal named Isla and some do-nothing type. Her father&apos;s well-placed, though. If anyone knows where to find the queen, it&apos;s him. Micheil Ros is his name. Tell him I sent you.
Favourable Wind Scroll
*Tell the rat to watch its mouth.*
*The spirit raises his head and looks down his nose at you. He has nothing more to tell you.*
Easy for you to say. You&apos;re not the only one in the crosshairs.
[SEBILLE] *Say that you suppose it will end in a quiet kind of freedom.*
[IFAN] *You&apos;ve heard clients use this phrase before. Ask her if she&apos;s Black Ring.*
*Gareth relaxes. Inhale. Exhale. His voice dims.*
My thanks for your help in dealing with the Sourcerer, lizard.
Having stolen the Source that was stolen by the Gods, Dallis fled with the Aeteran to Arx. Whatever she&apos;s up to, it can&apos;t be good.
*Reach for your blade. This is not a joking matter.*
*Say you see... her. Lohse, the same person you travelled with before.*
*Squints...* Oh hey, you&apos;re right. You look just like Kristof though. But I reckon he was got rid of, now that I think of it. Time sure flies.
Molly the Dog
Enough innocents have been lost today. I pray he is not among them...
*Note that it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;possible for him to thank you too little.*
Maybe? No... Maybe? No... Maybe? Oh, what&apos;s the use.
Unlock Magic
Dungeon - Empty Room (Two Squares B)
If there&apos;s a Magister still free in this city, we&apos;re gonna find the swine.
Let me show you what happens to thieves around here...
Who are you? &lt;i&gt;What &lt;/i&gt;are you?
*She slinks over and cups your chin in her hand - not entirely gently.*
*Surmise that by hiding himself in your soul, he&apos;s turned you into a target for every Voidwoken in the world.*
The God King said if I could find Dallis, eliminate her, I could take my place by his side again. But Kemm... he doesn&apos;t like competition. All it took was a few whispers.
*Admit you hadn&apos;t heard about the cat who lost all it&apos;s money.*
...Yes, yes, it has done an admirable job so far. It&apos;s certainly lasted longer than I thought it would.
Large Masterwork Rune
Crafting Bible, Part XVI
You shameless little...
A bow that looks as though it were carved from solidified shadow. Cold to the touch, it envelops you in murky shade when used.
Character is carrying too much weight.
Burning Blaze
We, the Seven, are gathered here in these horrid halls of echoes, dead spirits vying for rebirth.
Psst. Stickface. Wanna buy some stuff? Wanna sell some stuff?
Hi there, shorty-bumpkins. What&apos;s your name?
*Cat? Ask the man who he&apos;s talking about.*
*Tell Ifan you understand his rage, but vengeance is hollow. He&apos;s better than that.*
Small Fire Salamander
Most wise. Do not come back here - only a cauldron of blood awaits.
*She lays her hand on your skull and you see it clearly - the others, the Gods, Amadia, and &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. You are her chosen. You are her Godwoken.*
*He folds his arms and looks away, clearly not interested in what you&apos;re after.*
*He shows you a lever and tells you it must be powered. That, you&apos;ll have to work out for yourself.*
Speak to Tovah if speak you must, I speak no more with you.
I believe so. But... we won&apos;t let that happen.
*Describe your battle against Mordus, every last scritch and scrape.*
*Shrug. Tell him you&apos;ve no idea what he&apos;s on about.*
[DWARF] *Blow your nose and wait for this elven nonsense to end.*
No-one tells me there are so many &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt; in this Fort Joy. Magisters I handle, but small ones... We do not have many in my tribe anymore. And in yours?
Do you have any idea who this spy is?
EMERGENCY FLUSH PROTOCOL
...my Mihaly needs attention.
[BARBARIAN] *Bring your fist down upon the puppet&apos;s head.*
Let me out of here!
*Ask what brought the Voidwoken here.*
*Ask who the shadow is. Who wants you dead?*
*She looks you squarely in the eyes.*
Did you know Malady taught me how to sneak out of here, even though we&apos;re in the Hall of Echoes? So I can still get some things for you, if you want...
Hallo.
*Tell her she&apos;s welcome.*
Allow LAN connections
I&apos;m sorry for the inconvenience, but it is simply too much trouble to let you live.
Pole
An ancient library. I feel right at home.
Priestess
*The dwarf sets his jaw and firmly refuses to speak until you ask him something else.*
&lt;i&gt; T h e   B l a c k . . .   t h e   B l a c k . . .   t h e   B l a c k . . .&lt;/i&gt;
*Leave it be.*
*Cross your arms and wait for the squirrel to speak again.*
Oh, don&apos;t look so astonished. I simply suspect we&apos;ve had much the same experience. We met with our god: you with Duna, I with Zorl-Stissa.
*The statue gestures toward the heavens, a striking image amidst the graves and sepulchres.*

Dome Of Protection
*Tell her you aren&apos;t sure if you have any spells that would help her, but if she wants you to try, she&apos;ll need to calm down.*
[BEAST] *Snap at him to stand to attention when he talks to a captain. Tell him you sail for yourself and &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;shall take his orders from &lt;i&gt;you!*&lt;/i&gt;
Quite expedient, isn&apos;t it? Dallis seems to have made a ship out of an ancestor tree, then found a way to bind the spirit within to her alone.
To our esteemed Madam, by special invitation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are invited to share in the matrimony day of my darling daughter Isla in the week of Lucian&apos;s Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wedding will be held in our estate in Arx, with all provisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking forward to your gracious presence,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micheil Ros
*Three...*
*Sebille twirls her ghostly needle, her face is set in a defiant scowl.*
Judeline
Baran Levere told us that the Lone Wolves are killing the Godwoken.
Sturdy bows and sharp arrows, here for the choosing.
Ah. You have meant so much. Too much. You are&lt;i&gt; theirs &lt;/i&gt;now. The people&apos;s. You can&apos;t be mine too. Besides - I have the feelin&apos; your dark counterpart may have a tendency to... get in the way.
The Council of Four met here? Lady Kemm certainly seems proud.
Please, return the jar to me. You must!
*Take your leave.*
You and I make a deal. Not an alliance.
The Sallow Man will give me the key to the mountain if I make the Godwoken accept the God King&apos;s covenant - or kill them all.
They did something to me. They made me want to hurt people. People who smell like you.
Skills that cost
[The volume lists a great many weapons and their origins. It is not a thickly-paged book, however, and it falls open to a page that has been clearly read and re-read.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been known by many names in many languages. Now, it is called Anathema - a blade capable of killing the first target it touches, yet no more than that, a crystalline sword that could so much as destroy a god, but would lie dormant forever and after.
*The creature stares at you, molten slime dripping from its maw.*
Ingredient
Fare thee well! We&apos;ll tell Jimmy you stopped by.
*She raises one hand and raises herself to her feet. She looks clouded, somehow; where she&apos;s usually sharp as a dagger, she now seems... soft.*
A step back? Fine. If that pleases you...
*Hold up your hand. You said he was dead; that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re free.*
I prayed to the Seven as a child and they failed me at every turn. Perhaps the Eighth can do better...
*Leave her be.*
As such I have named you. As such I have blessed you. And now yours is the power to bless in turn.
*Tell him that he&apos;s going to pay for what he did to those wedding guests!*
