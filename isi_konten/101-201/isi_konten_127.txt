Oh thank the gods! They had me over a barrel. You have to believe me! It&apos;s hard enough to earn a crust around here, and me and the young one, we&apos;ve been starving.
[ELF] *Linger anyway, saying you&apos;re starved for elven company.*
You don&apos;t know his nature. He wanders the planes of the living &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the dead. I... I can&apos;t escape him.
[LOHSE] *Laslor? Tell her he&apos;s an old acquaintance from years ago. You came upon him in Fort Joy.*
Marketplace 02
You &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; strike me? Step back at once!
*Laughs.* Sendin&apos; Almira&apos;s swine to kill a pig! That be right. Yow&apos;ll find Lucian&apos;s brat with the elves, way northwards. If yow don&apos;t find death before it.

*His face is suddenly against yours... and he sees you for what you are. Bone without skin; alive, but not living. He pauses. And smiles.*
The Gods. Are they dead? How can this be?
Better pick sides before the time comes.
*The needle pierces Tir-Cendelius&apos; gossamer flesh. A heartbeat strong as a quake reverberates through the metal and into your hand, arm, chest.*
No! DAMN it!
In that case, I should be able to lift mountains by now.
An active imagination... overheated, even. Perhaps you should let this matter rest. Your blood is up after your adventures, it seems. You wouldn&apos;t want to do anything rash...
Mosquito Swarm
Not to freak out when I see mythical animals?
Tiny Chest
Damn it all. It won&apos;t budge.
Drop Item
Must be a hell of a thing to have a demon feeling nervous.
Chicken Touch Scroll
And then, awake. On an isle I&apos;d never been, encircled by faces I&apos;d never seen, watched by a man I&apos;d never known. They called him doctor. He shouted strange words - and the demon bellowed. Then one by one... I...

*Describe the man that you saw, including his armour.*
You fiend! I saw how you fed upon Source like that. You&apos;ll receive no aid from me! &lt;i&gt;Nothing!&lt;/i&gt;
*Zorl-Stissa&apos;s onyx eyes glisten in their sockets - your sockets. Your gut hardens and your belly roils as a great whorling hole opens deep in your gut.*

*The guard shrugs back.*
*Ask the cat if it would like you to put it out of its misery.*
You did it - &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;spoke to it! &lt;/i&gt;Blessings to you, Sourcerer; now we can escape this place!
[LOHSE] *You showed them the same respect your own soul received.*
*He&apos;s friends with a Magister? Tell Gareth he needs to keep better company.*

*Say you intend to slay those who have hurt your kind. The revenge you exact will belong to all elves.*

*Insist that the Doctor has perished. You know this to be true; he must abandon his fear.*
Divinity eludes you still, but even in Malady&apos;s absence, I&apos;ve the feeling it won&apos;t elude you much longer. Think about what it means to become a god. Prove worthy of it.
*The spirit shivers and shimmies - and then is gone, lost to nothingness, its Source now lurking within you.*
It&apos;s... not been easy here since. I can&apos;t help but wonder when Dallis will retaliate. And what form that retaliation will take.

*Tell him you&apos;ll go get the ring yourself.*

*You think of how the Eternals came as Voidwoken to reclaim their stolen world.*
Are you a dwarf? You&apos;re so cool. You&apos;re taller than I thought. I heard dwarves like to sing! Will you sing me a song?

*Decline his request.*
We could use her here. She&apos;s a tough old thing. Meaty, too.
Amadia&apos;s Sanctuary
We few Seeker survivors fled there. It&apos;s safe enough, for now. You&apos;ll find something of a welcome, at least.
At least for now.
[SCHOLAR] *Peer at the red lever. It looks like an ignition purger... sounds dangerous. Pull it anyway.*
I see. No harm in the truth then - I killed those Magister pigs, and put their carcasses in my pot.

Now hurry back! I can&apos;t wait to hear if your ventures can hold a candle to the other... I mean, to my own!
Now let&apos;s swat away these useless gnats, shall we?
You boil my blood, only to stand idle? The indignity fans the flames!
*She looks out over the waves. For a while, the sound of them lapping on the beach is the only thing you hear.*
Oh hi! How are you? I&apos;m good! Hey, do you smell that? Smells like the fish place, doesn&apos;t it? Like fish only... worse. &apos;kay bye!

The Barbarian
In the meantime though, let us continue our search for Brahmos. He knows things. Things &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; must know.
Tin Stockings
Guess that makes me a sinner. *Sips.* Perhaps you can help us settle an argument.
[BEAST] *Run a hand from your chin and down the length of your beard with a flourish. Tell her she can see that much for herself.*
Better a den of refugee lizards than a Voidwoken nest, I suppose. I can&apos;t say either option thrills me much.
None of your business, inmate. Find me if you hear of a Migo. Otherwise, don&apos;t waste my time.
*Hazard to answer the mysterious figure: You&apos;re... fine, all things considered.*
I Understand
Excellent. This won&apos;t take a moment.

Get out. You are not the one I&apos;m here to meet.
*Before he can respond to your criticism, his eyes roll back, and he passes out from the pain.*
Skull
*Fane is clearly... not necessarily &lt;i&gt;happy&lt;/i&gt;, but certainly content. He stows the contraption in his pack.*
They are already dead. They will not be mourned.
*Reply with &apos;1227&apos;.*
*Ask what he&apos;d do if he did run into one of these &apos;knights&apos;.*
[BEAST] *Tell her you&apos;re just a person with more baggage than you want.*
