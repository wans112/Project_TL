Elemental Totem Skillbook
*Gone is the strange mirror image of yourself: before you stands the goddess Amadia in all her spectral glory.*
*The cub looks up at you with the saddest eyes you&apos;ve ever seen.*
How you lack in vision. By the time I&apos;m done, I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; have real castles in the sky.
*Whatever words he meant to come next go unspoken. The wide-eyed and tongue-tied dwarf can only nod and blush in thanks.*
*The dwarf leans back from the table and strokes his beard, gold medallions jingling merrily. His eyes roll over to you.*
That&apos;s the spot...
Combat Ability points
Ahh, nearly forgot you had a touch o&apos; the gift about you. Always were the sensitive type.
[SEBILLE] *Tell the dwarf that&apos;s preposterous. Ifan is your manicurist!*
You can&apos;t play my game!
*Give her your hand.*
*Reach out to bathe the blood from her feet.*
*One step. Then another. Ever closer. You can tell from her bearing Sebille has never been so ready to kill, so on the brink of impending action. She&apos;s like a cat, all concentrated muscle, that split second before it pounces.*
I came for the Swornbreaker. I found only Kemm&apos;s fury. This is what becomes of the King&apos;s fallen angels, Godwoken. Mockery. Torture. Decay.
Not shock, no... perhaps a little light-headed...
But you are here, Godwoken. There is still a chance. Do you wish to accept my help?
Fleetfoot
*With a smile, he claps you on the back, before packing up the crossbow once more.*
There ain&apos;t nothing more I can tell yeh. Now get going and leave me be!
*Thank him for his faith and turn away.*
*Demand she return your gold to you, &lt;i&gt;now.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The creature quivers with sorrow and starts to loudly weep.*
*A voice materialises in your mind. &lt;i&gt;&apos;I will care for you. I will be your champion. You deserve that much.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Bansuri
*Tell him the salamanders are dead, so there&apos;s no need to worry.*
No lesions, no trauma... he was bled by magic.
*His face goes slack as the pain renders him senseless.*
Fix the &apos;Mistake&apos;.
Tvahstar
*The cook maintains even, unblinking eye contact.*
*Tell her she&apos;s been very naughty and should get those clothes off immediately... and also very slowly.*
*You explore the remaining ingredients, but you&apos;ve already taken everything you need.*
DEBUG BOOK
I am the scourge... I am the light...
I can&apos;t talk now... there&apos;s a battle afoot - we need to be prepared...
[SCHOLAR] *Reveal to Tarquin your experience with the spirit and the heirloom.*
You should have seen them all, on their knees worshipping a new tyrant just to spite seven old ones... I got away from them while I still could. Unfortunately, Dallis was waiting to snatch me.
*It said it was &apos;drained&apos;. By whom?*
They are dead because you run away. They are dead because you do not want to be the heart!
Aye. Tending and have been grow by their largest fans. Good little gnomans.
*Return to a previous subject.*
Hero of Winter
Amadia has not gifted me the grace to heal, nor the strength to fight. There is nothing more I can do.
Can you feel it, dwarf?
*A vault? Where is it? Where is Mordus hiding?*
Dungeon - Empty Room Dead End B
The Gods must have their reasons. Besides, the world they&apos;ve given to us is worth fighting for - the alternative doesn&apos;t bear thinking about.
*Smile. Well, if Quercus believes in you...*
Baran&apos;s Burning Dagger
Now Han, let&apos;s see how the others are doing now that your leg&apos;s all healed.
Hard cheese! Lasts forever! Full of marrowbone jelly!
No care about some puny &apos;Marg&apos;! Other trolls are weak next to Krug - nothing can defeat Krug. No cave for you.
*Bite your lip. This all seems very suspicious...*
*You don&apos;t know what to say. What does this all mean?*
*Repeat the phrase: &apos;Hallowed Seven, hear our prayer, we who worship at your altar.*
*Remind him she too plays some part in this. She&apos;s sworn to another, remember?*
As you wish... just remember - without Lord Arhu, you will not be able to proceed.
Deals [1] each turn.
*Ask him how he plans to leave the island now.*
Gareth told us of his plan to escape on board of the Lady Vengeance. We should try to help him if we want to get away from this place. Above all, we need to clear a path through any Magister defences on the shore, before the ship can be taken.
I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; speak with this man. Please stay close and keep an eye out for assassins in the shadows.
To the Beast o&apos; the Sea: I thought you might want this back. Fight fiercely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Duna
*Tell her you&apos;d love for her to join you.*
Find a way through.
Deathfog Crate
Robe of Knowledge
*Succumb to the urge. You will release her, and these games she plays will end, once and for all.*
I might have saved my people, but at the cost of this world? It leaves a sour taste in my- well, suffice to say, I could be happier.
Knife
&lt;i&gt;GET OUT OF HERE!&lt;/i&gt;
I didn&apos;t make no mess! I make &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;mess in the garden!
Amyro marked an escape route on our map. Once free of the island, we are to tell his people that Saheila is in Fort Joy.
[SCHOLAR] *Say you understand his concerns, but this collar you&apos;re sporting is very effective.*
I wonder if the artist was present for the meeting, or if the leaders posed elsewhere...
Hope they&apos;ll leave some for me...
Indeed, although those insects snatched you up like they were picking fruit. They were worryingly precise about it...
*Wink and tell him you meant, you know... &lt;i&gt;lonely.*&lt;/i&gt;
Please *cough* help! Healing... I need healing!
We were able to lift the curse from the feathers.
*His gaze stays fixed on yours. Anger billows in the darks of his eyes.*
I&apos;ll have her eyeball, when she&apos;s done with it. Won&apos;t be long now.
No.
My darling, my light, it&apos;s so good to hear you say that.
Rich Dwarf Citizen
*Squeak, squeak!*
*Say that you have little taste for art, least of all now.*
Figured I knew ya - one of Lohar&apos;s, eh? You&apos;re late. But... guess that&apos;s a good thing. I&apos;ll unlock the door for you...
Unlock the hatch.
Meat Golem Cage Key
*Grab at Lohse to restrain her.*
That&apos;s the water taken care of - but it looks like that hatch needs a key.
*Say you find it hard to picture anyone living in this harsh environment for years and years.*
I doubt she will ever forgive me for what I did. Then again, perhaps she will understand some day. Doing terrible things for good reasons seems to be a family trait.
*Tell him to relax. You&apos;re sure Alexandar is dead.*
I&apos;m the fourth generation of my family to work this land. Those monstrosities swept away my family&apos;s legacy like it was nothing.
*He turns away.*
Exploration Theme 06 Dark Orchestral
Thought &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;must have died when that ship went down. Guess wolves can swim, ha!
Whatever&apos;s on that page is none of your concern. &lt;i&gt;Let the dead rest&lt;/i&gt;.
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;VELVET KISS&lt;/b&gt;.*
Oblivion takes shape, my friend.
*Pluck the egg from the fire.*
*Grunt. Braccus sounds like the kind of Sourcerer you wouldn&apos;t mind Dallis getting her hands on.*
*Step forward, saying this is injustice at best and base cruelty at worst.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve discovered Lohar is behind the smuggling ring in Driftwood.*
*The boy stands back from you, steady eyes grimly surveying the wrecked boat.*
*Growl...* &lt;i&gt;I kiiiiiiiill you, leg-meat.&lt;/i&gt;
Oh no, she was a god. By your standards.
Quid pro quo, I&apos;m afraid. A tad vulgar of me, that much I admit, but needs must when the demon drives.
A shepherd cares for his flock, just as I care for you.
Permanent
*Attack her.*
Bow or Crossbow
As for me... the God King never forgot my failure. I know not why he keeps me alive. Each day may be the day that I will finally be punished. That I may finally pay for my sins.
Yes, leave. Leave my temple. Leave this island. Leave my champion to do their work.
And you know what must be done - and why it must be done quickly.
*Mention that there was a little... accident... in the cargo deck. The prisoner&apos;s dead.*
*Tell him you want in.*
Possessed Summoner
But maybe you should give it a bit of time. I imagine it takes almighty power a little while to settle in.
The blood of legions trails you, ben-Mezd. The stench of your past corrupts&lt;i&gt;... corrupts&lt;/i&gt;...
Thank you ssho musch. So &lt;i&gt;musch&lt;/i&gt;.
*Growl...* &lt;i&gt;I kiiiiiiiill you, dead-meat.&lt;/i&gt;
We may only trust in each other. And I do trust in you. That is why I chose you: you have a pure soul. Even the others-
But at least I&apos;ve new directions. When we escape and find ourselves on the mainland once more, I must search for Brahmos the Wanderer.
Lohar won&apos;t be happy about this mess...
Dialogues
*Now that she&apos;s free, ask her what she&apos;ll do now.*
*They look each other in the eyes like two chess players contemplating their next move.*
*Together you plunge the blade deep into Sarias&apos;s heart. The elves then twist the blade three times, in practiced motion. Blood flows freely to the ground, and Sarias&apos;s heart lies open to the world, neatly cut in four.*
*He nods an acknowledgement of your presence.*
*You are... an abomination. A crucified figure, blazing with Source.  You hear screams, and then the scent of charred flesh.*
Character is deactivated.
But I will be with you. I will guide you; stand by you. I will watch as you drink from the Wellspring, and as its Source surges into you.
I don&apos;t even remember them strapping me down.
*The bear cub blinks. Sniffles.*
I&apos;ll keep my teeth firmly in my mouth next time.
HA! Well if that&apos;s the truth, then a little potion won&apos;t do any harm either way.
Fane claims Divinity. I agree, and will stand with him at the Well of Ascension.
*Ifan stands back with his arms folded, glowering at Alexandar.*
(A dwarven joke did the rounds, it ends with the punchline: &apos;So Lucian dropped the Deathfog on them again!&apos;)
None
I swear, I should&apos;ve expected nothing less. They wander across a tragedy and how do they spend their time?
UI Hotbar Next
[UNDEAD] *Remark that his comfort in the presence of an undead like you might suggest that he&apos;s familiar with necromancy...*
*The Magister cowers, oblivious to you. The dreamer is twisting her own mind into maze of her worst nightmares.*
Mummie Dearest
Cowhide Gloves
Look. I don&apos;t know how to ask you this, but... you alright up there?
You are my master&apos;s guest. I welcome you as long as he does. Treat with him.
*Note his anxiety - and say you&apos;re nervous too. This wasn&apos;t such a good idea after all.*
Please, Fulton! You&apos;re scaring me... let me know you&apos;re alright!
Blessed &amp; Cursed Surfaces
[JESTER] *Laugh, and say he might have gotten more than he bargained for.*
*Symbols radiate from the slab&apos;s central rune, but you do not know their meaning.*
N-n-nope.
You are the fool. The doors to you are closed. But Braccus Rex is just, his high judge generous. Would you like to try again?
Well, that&apos;s one less Red to worry about. BYE!
Dead. Bled dry. What creature could have done this?
Yes, sire! The honourable Brahmos sensed them closing in, you see. He had no choice but to flee from Driftwood.
Wanted. Sounds better than it is.
*Roll your eyes.*
*Gareth acknowledges you with a menacing glare.*
Equip
I&apos;ve a boat here with plenty of room. Let&apos;s go.
See? Nay. Sense? Good gods, yes.
