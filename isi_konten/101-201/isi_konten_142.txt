The most powerful scrolls are made with Source orbs. These are Source skills that you can cast at will, without requiring Source. One example is to start writing a scroll as you would write any Pyrokinetic scroll, with something sharp, but use the Source orb as an ingredient.
Miracle Gloves
This demon gluts itself on pain. Only the utmost torture would draw him forth. I couldn&apos;t do it. I refused to subject myself or my comrades to such... such barbarism.
So this is where the Sourcerers were taken...
Speak to Tovah.
Sudden Death!
*The cub quietly sobs over its dead mother, ignoring your presence.*
*Ask if she served under a Paladin Hardwin.*
Perhaps you have noticed the &apos;safe&apos; in the floor? You will find it just beside the wall bed.
Well, you&apos;ve got nerve, I&apos;ll give you that. Can&apos;t give you a break for it, though. You&apos;ll be taking holiday in a prison cell.
*Hmm!*
*No, but you would like to know who you&apos;re speaking to.*
Oh my! I wasn&apos;t always a merchant on the seas, you know. Before I hitched a ride on your ship, I had many adventures.
*Ask her if she truly crafted the Deathfog bomb, as Zanisima claims.*
Greasy Key
*The ghost sways from side to side, the firelight flickering through the shade of what he used to be.*
P
One day a red sun rose, turning the desert sands into a blood-coloured sea. When my mother, roused from dreams, beheld this crimson dawn she knew the time had come, and promptly gave birth to me.
Bucket with Milk
Nor to me, I&apos;m afraid.
If the first two statements are true, then the third must be...?
Destroy them! They must not get to the Princess!
*She nods and turns as if to take her leave but stumbles, falling a little into your arms. She laughs, embarrassed, and quickly rights herself.*
*She curtsies deeply. As she rises, she loses her footing and stumbles forward, half into your arms. She quickly rights herself with a nervous laugh.*
At first it was nothing - wolves, elves, deer: the usual forest vermin. But before long she stole away &lt;i&gt;thinking &lt;/i&gt;creatures.
Our attack is repelled. Our brother, Sarias, dies in battle against Lone Wolves. Our ritual honours him, and sows him in the earth for rebirth as an ancestor tree.
Bark
Magic Armour Restoration
*Apparently, even a ghost can blush. Her face darkens, anger and embarrassment visible in equal measure.*
The judge has condemned your kind - and I smell the stench of your guilt with every Gods-damned breath you take!
*Shake your head. You can&apos;t smell anything.*
You found it! How wonderful! The wife will be thrilled! Or - she would if she ever found out about this, which of course she won&apos;t. But I can&apos;t thank you enough!
*He turns from you and with a grunt of effort, flings the book out into the sea.*
Stay back. It&apos;s for your own good.
Perhaps I have misjudged humans? Alexandar seems as immortal as I!
Guards! This one threatens me, your royal princess! KILL HIM!
Come on boys, let&apos;s give Ifan some privacy and head on out to wait for the next &lt;i&gt;guest...&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask if the search has been fruitful.*
He promised me a lasting seat at his glorious table in return for my oath. For the King chooses only the strongest. The most loyal. The most deserving!
What else? We&apos;re both torn to bits.
*Source snakes from your eyes and fingers and into hers - and you are Kari, clad in Red Magisters&apos; garb, righteous and ready.*
Very well, then. To arms!
*Nod. If that&apos;s how she feels, you won&apos;t try to change her mind.*
You know I&apos;m not so keen on that stuff, Ovis.
The more the merrier. It&apos;s been too long since my last bloodbath.
*Agree. Lying and betrayal are no mark of divinity.*
Let&apos;s see, now... Oh - I have just the thing! Just a spritz, mind you.
So do I. By the Divine, so do I. If Bishop Alexandar doesn&apos;t rise... I don&apos;t know who will protect us from this darkness.
Off we go then!
We ventured onwards without concluding our dealings with Almira. If anyone fulfills her wishes, it won&apos;t be us.
I&apos;m a &lt;i&gt;country &lt;/i&gt;healer - understand, lad? I work for a living, not like those soft-handed fops who tend to merchants&apos; parchment cuts in Arx.
I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re too late. My working day is over.
Seems you spill a bit of blood. Now it&apos;s my turn.
Only the Red Prince knows the truth.
My ears are still a-ringing.
You&apos;re done, kid.
A good joke would help me feel alive again - truly alive. If you encounter one, do let me know.
*Smile at her and say that they&apos;re very lucky to have such a talented Sourcerer with them.*
Riveted Mail Hood
*Implore him to calm down. What madness does he mean?*
For the most part... a copy can be seen at the Great Cathedral, here in Arx. I visit frequently, for inspiration...
You... you come into &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;house and sling around such a disgusting lie?
Rogue
*Tell her she was under Mordus&apos; evil influence - and if it weren&apos;t for you, she still would be.*
*Hunting.*
*Uhhn...*
*As if they took the armour from a vine-choked corpse, by any chance.*
*Groan*
*Ask her what Laslor would do in her position: let the Magisters walk all over him, or fight to help other Sourcerers.*
Perish the thought! No, I merely want to acquaint you with something exceptional:
*You pull away, desperately gasping for breath.*
Get lost. Coward.
*She smiles, a malicious and hateful little grin.*
You&apos;d best go, before I change I mind about that skin of yours.
From Magic Armour ability: [1][2]%
*Say that you&apos;ll be ready to proceed as soon as possible.*
&apos;Character.&apos; I like that. I&apos;m gonna use that.
I heard his screams. I heard something... &lt;i&gt;eating &lt;/i&gt;him. From the inside. Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.
Do you sense it, Lohse? I think there&apos;s... there&apos;s a spirit within.
He kills a Scion. A precious person; a person who holds the memories of our people. A person who can heal the Ancestor Forests - the forests that have been cut to pieces and sold off into slavery.
*His eyes narrow, and one yellowed molar appears as he begins to sneer...*
Fake Fullscreen
Would the Divine swing the Swornbreaker Scythe?
Just when I think I&apos;ve heard it all, you go and serve up that ridiculous story.
Hold there, dwarf! I answered your question, but you did not answer mine.
Oh, cast spells, tinker with relics, meddle with the laws of nature - all the sorts of things power-hungry despots love to do. She had me enchant a dead cat over there, so it would seem alive.
Green Noxious Bulb
I am told not only has the criminal been found, but that he has a bomb.
There was so much wrong with the world. So much that I needed to fix. So I sought power elsewhere.
Mouse Scroll Up
Alexandar does not rise. You fool yourself to think otherwise.
Didn&apos;t catch your name, though. I&apos;m Mari.
Breeches of Wisdom
*Stare in shock. She&apos;s speaking the Eternal tongue!*
*Promise that you&apos;ll be careful - you won&apos;t touch any evidence.*
[JESTER] *Give her a bear hug.*
Move Mouse Up
You&apos;ve got enough in front of yous, elf!
You would mock the beast after crawling into its mouth?
Soul Bond
*Screw up your face and look at her closely. She&apos;s not like any of the elves you&apos;ve met so far.*
[OUTLAW] *Say that you&apos;re more than alright - it felt good to spill a little Magister blood after what they&apos;ve done to you.*
Like you, he is a lizard. No doubt he slithers close to the temple of your fork-tongued goddess: Zorl-Stissa.
No! It is too late for them. You need that Source more than they.
*The spirit doesn&apos;t move. She just vanishes - consumed.*
*As she turns from you, the whites of her eyes darken, the veins in her face go grey, and a wicked smile curls her mouth.*
Queen Justinia used dwarven criminals to smuggle Deathfog to the city of Arx.
Shut up. &lt;i&gt;Shut up!&lt;/i&gt;
Now - now I must do as duty requires...
There&apos;s somethin&apos; of you, you know. You don&apos;t have to accept your fate on this bloody island. You can leave here; get on with your life.
Not for me to say - I just work here. How about you leave me get back to that work, eh?
Perhaps you are no Magister, but nor are you a simple traveller. I can see the Gods&apos; mark upon you. My master has been seeking you.
Ah, yes. That is better. That is &lt;i&gt;so &lt;/i&gt;much better. Truly, dying does not become a god.
*Whisper that you are in the business of dried meats, and are in need of a few &apos;little helpers&apos; yourself.*
You&apos;ve earned nothin&apos; but a boot in your licker. It&apos;s only Duna&apos;s grace keepin&apos; my foot at bay. Do you truly not know the price our people paid after your hasty &apos;revolution&apos;?
*Admit that he&apos;s right. Humanity&apos;s ruthlessness can barely mask its insecurity.*
Sure. Have a look.
*Tell her you&apos;ve found someone hiding in the factory.*

Search the sewers.
Fully charged, you say...? That would mean that five souls have been, erm... actually, I&apos;d rather not dwell on exactly &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;you charged the device. Onto the next matter:
Good boy.
A strategist. And yet you are not too circumspect to land the killing blow. A dangerous combination.
*She reaches for you eagerly.*
For a fancy party that&apos;ll really knock &apos;em dead.
Didn&apos;t you? You looked at all the choices we had to make as we travelled together, but sacrificing this world was where you drew the line?
*She&apos;s telling you. The last thing you want is to spend time training under her!*
Dain&apos;s as stubborn as an old steer. Says he don&apos;t believe in alchemy and won&apos;t accept a potion from me or anyone else. The jackanape would rather die than drink somethin&apos; that ain&apos;t at least thirty proof!
Yes indeed. All of my people&apos;s Source. Spread across the mortal races...
*The mechanism clicks.*
Lever
*Tell her to calm herself; the Magisters won&apos;t like to hear she&apos;s been causing unrest during such trying times.*
Pretty eyes. Eyes that see far.
And yes, he was a Source Master. He also killed many of those we could have turned to. He stole their knowledge, then he stole their lives, and then he stole their Source.
Ripper
What are you waiting for, a red carpet? Go on, &lt;i&gt;go on&lt;/i&gt;.
Although you will not return unchanged. As your first step towards righting the wrongs of this world, I grant you my blessing.
*The spirit of a woman looks around, deeply upset. She doesn&apos;t seem to notice you.*
[DWARF] *Your inner god whispers an ancient blessing in a long-forgotten dwarven dialect to you. You repeat it to the priestess.*
The Mist Descends
I... Well of course that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m not very fond of you as well, it&apos;s just that...
Vanished. Into thin air. Not even the Divine could have pulled off a feat &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; impressive.
Scale Gloves
The dying dark is coming, prince. Come to the dying dark.
*Bid him pray.*
*You were a genius maze-builder. Clear of mind, sharp of wit. You built an invisible staircase, useful to those who may find it.*
Ah, you&apos;re back! Please - did you find Erma? She &lt;i&gt;still &lt;/i&gt;hasn&apos;t returned. Where could she be, my dear girl...
Plank
I hate to admit it, but sometimes you can&apos;t blame the Magisters for wanting to cull the use of Source.
Will those scales protect you from fireballs, freak?
Good god, that is NOT a sight I like to see...
I know this feeling all too well. But until you are ready for what comes next, you may stay here as long as you wish.
