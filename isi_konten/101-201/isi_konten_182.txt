It doesn&apos;t matter what &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;said, &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am the authority here, &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am the Magister Inquisitor, and &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am charged with ending Sourcerers. Kilgallion lies dead by your hand, and you, you stinking Sourcerer, &lt;i&gt;will join him!&lt;/i&gt;
[LOHSE] *Claim that you didn&apos;t just respect them; you made them dance.*
I underestimated you, Sourcerer. Or is it... GODWOKEN?
Guards! Guards! HELP!
Outlaw
There are more Masters of the Source, more aspects of the Source to learn. The hunt continues, my prince.
Velvety Pouch
I have arrived in a strange realm, unlike any I have ever seen before. I should explore carefully.
And you, in your infinite wisdom, would know what is &apos;better&apos;? You would judge your enemies without prejudice, and make decisions that could hurt your own for the greater good?
purged the Godwoken and used the Source to close the veil to the Void.
Hmmm... You were in a cellar with other Sourcerers. Watching. Staring at them. Hoping that none would stare back.
Be good, you scallywags!
Watch yourself.

*Tell her you&apos;ve heard of the Seekers.*
Our old master would be proud.
Using the Swornbreaker, I freed myself from the Covenant and the will of the God King.
*Tell her she&apos;s right. &lt;i&gt;She &lt;/i&gt;should be paying &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Make to walk away.*
The Magisters can quiet the songs of Source using their collars and cages. I would normally call it a cruelty. But this Windego &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;... she must be contained.
Big Tomorrah told us of a lever in Lord Kemm&apos;s garden that reveals a secret hatch to his vaults.
Did you find him? Did you find Peeper&apos;s Papa?
*Tell her to run. The way is clear... you think.*
*Your mind leaps from one of Ryker&apos;s memories to the next. You struggle to control the visions as they rush past your inner eye faster than you can identify them.*
Reckon I spooked. Big ol&apos; nasty beast popped outta thin air. So I ran and then... *chews* suddenly, ravine.
Absorb the Source from Meistr Siva&apos;s fountain.
*Growl!*
So tell me, Lohse girl, any o&apos; those voices o&apos; yours explained how the devil the Order intends to cure us anyhow?
*Back away.*
Physical Immunity
*Say that you&apos;re willing to try another, if the reward is increased to match your efforts...*
Don&apos;t be rude, Ben. She&apos;s a lizard. It&apos;s not her fault she&apos;s ugly.
... the B... B... B...
Lizard-Flesh Stew
*Say you have shed as few tears as she. His was a death long deserved.*
Arrow Stunning
Dead Silent Watcher
*As suddenly as it came, the voice has gone and you wake from its presence as from dream-filled slumber.*
For they will all walk the same path as you, but they cannot be allowed to reach its end. You must be the one. Only one of our people can wield this power. Only &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
*He smirks at you.*
Even more corpses here. Good riddance.
*Say it&apos;s really bad. The gods seemed all but dead. That&apos;s a nine or full ten out of ten.*
*Casually cross your arms and say you&apos;ve heard he might be able to help you.*
Howling dogs and men. Friends, silently screaming through stitched mouths...
*Growl that he&apos;s a liar through and through - demand to know why you shouldn&apos;t just gut him right now.*
Devourer&apos;s Slumber
Connection failed
Whittled from Driftwood timber and wound with bright silken ribbon, this staff is ready to act as a conduit for your magical energy.
As such, my first priority remains to find the Lone Wolves. They are in league with the one I search...
[SCHOLAR] *The signs are all there. Say that you believe she is a succubus.*
*An inscription at the terrarium&apos;s base identifies its contents as a &apos;wailing mandrake&apos; - a species you&apos;ve not heard of before now.*
Do you know, this &apos;Arx&apos; place doesn&apos;t look half bad.
*How resolute he looks; how royal his bearing!*
*Wonder where he was even trying to flee to.*
Here&apos;s the final truth, Sebille: the true evil here is not me, it&apos;s you.
*Tell him not to be a fool. He&apos;s seen what you do to your enemies.*
*Tell the elf you&apos;ve done enough for him.*
[SCHOLAR] *Quickly rephrase the question correctly for her: ...does anyone &lt;i&gt;hear?*&lt;/i&gt;
Collect the full set of the Devourer Armour.
In return for your &lt;i&gt;unsolicited action&lt;/i&gt;, you shall be rewarded with your life. You may leave this island, unharmed.
Finally figured that out, did you?
*Stolen? It couldn&apos;t be, the dwarf that sold it to you said his grandmother made it herself.*
Oh, how totally precious! You think you scare me!
Quite so. I am Murina the Brave! You are daring indeed to enter my domain!
Necklace of the Sun
*Refuse. What lies ahead is a mystery. You can&apos;t make a vow you might break.*
Quite a coincidence, to meet again like that, wouldn&apos;t you say...? Never mind- there are more important matters at hand...
Not many things rhyme with essence&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ve known since my adolescence&lt;br&gt;But shot by the bow&lt;br&gt;An elemental arrow&lt;br&gt;Is not like any other weapon
The water looks a bit cold to me.
*Her mouth narrows in a thin line of contempt.*
*Sigh* Me too.
You heard the way he spoke to me, didn&apos;t you? I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll lose any sleep over his violent demise.
Did you really think you could buy your way out of this? Off to prison with you!
*The arrow soars long and far, whistling a dusky tune as it flies against the breeze. It hits the target dead-on, fletchings quivering with the impact.*
Yeah, yeah, how you doin&apos;, et cetera.
*Reach out to touch the ghost.*
&lt;i&gt;Nothing&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;all good, sure as nothing&apos;s all bad. Can&apos;t throw the whole world in Fort Joy.
*Not trusting you, he takes it from your hand, half-expecting you to take it back. You don&apos;t. He slips the ring onto his finger, where it dangles loose.*
&lt;i&gt;Godsdammit &lt;/i&gt;I hate Lone - !
I feel it though. The past. My hopes. I don&apos;t know if you call that meaning, or foolishness, or what. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a word for it. But I feel it all the same.
Onward then! Let them strike when they may - we shall be ready for them.
*He looks around uneasily.*
*The iron touches you. So hot that it feels cold. The sound of your own screams fill your ears, while the smell of burning flesh and hair fills your nostrils.*
There&apos;s ways, but I ain&apos;t privy to &apos;em. One thing I do know, mind: the Voidwoken have their number. They react to Godwoken like no-one else.
*Tell the cub to go nuts. Join the circus. Start a band. Travel to the desert flats of Yuthul Gor.*
Venture into the shroud.
You did, but they didn&apos;t outweigh the dread of destiny.
Your enemies are more powerful than you! Consider fleeing and returning when you have more experience.

*Note that Klaud and his club seems like a good choice.*
Well isn&apos;t this pretty? It&apos;s got the elven touch.
*He&apos;s probably right. Drop it and turn away.*
*Say you&apos;re ready to face him now, without visiting his home plane. You won&apos;t go.*
*He&apos;s in pain. You can feel it. But you can also feel the great potential future that lies ahead.*
*You move to speak another chant, but the words elude you, snatched from your memories before you can utter them. The figure&apos;s wheezing lessens as its eyes lock on yours.*
*Say they have been pretty helpful.*
I will now be sated!
*Say you&apos;d love to know more about her.*
The Magisters helped me. And the dwarves, the merchants, the pilgrims... even the dogs helped me...
The cruelty of it makes me sick.
Crick on a cracker...
*Lay your hand on the guard&apos;s arm. Can they really punish you for taking something so beautiful?*
My head aches... and I&apos;m so &lt;i&gt;hungry&lt;/i&gt;. You... you look nice and meaty and delicious and chewable. *Shakes head* What did that... that &lt;i&gt;thing &lt;/i&gt;do to us?
*Scratch your head. Do skeletons really sleep?*
I see, yes...

*Mention that you&apos;ve had dealings with his kind before - Marg was her name - can&apos;t he just trust you and let you pass?*
Kin. Over here.
*He looks at the corpses surrounding him. Each of his children, slain as he watched. He tries to choke back tears, but soon they flow free, carving rivers through the grime on his face.*
*Note that you&apos;re more interested in devouring her Source.*
Ah. There you are. More than a silent monstrosity, less than a god. *Sigh*. In the end I&apos;m not totally convinced it was worth my while to restore your consciousness, seeing what you&apos;ve done with it so far.
*Claim to be a disciple of Arhu&apos;s - he&apos;ll want to see you at once.*

Your comrade is not available to fight. You bring them. Then you fight.

&lt;i&gt;And do I warn: not one step further&lt;/i&gt;. I know what you want here. But Qanna&apos;s already laid claim to it.
*The Magister turns to you, interest lighting up his handsome features.*
Who goes there?
*Shout that whether she&apos;s telling truth or lies, you won&apos;t find out by mutilating her.*
At the Magister barracks, a civilian begged us to save her paladin wife from execution at the hands of Lord Linder Kemm.
Alright, chief. Take it easy. This old bucket heaves like a hangover.
Spores. Old elven magic. The Magisters run. My armour find them. It is &lt;i&gt;of &lt;/i&gt;the spores.
