*The sky is dark and the roaring fire is now a sad flicker. The others lie around it in a circle, but you hear no snores. Their chests neither rise nor fall; their eyelids never twitch.*
True Brew: Amadouvier
In his cavern lair at the base of the mountain, the Sallow Man demands Bishop Alexandar&apos;s head.
*Flinching, look away.*
...
Infernal Gateway
A deep turquoise pigment, vibrant as the beaches of Fort Joy. Sniff it; it even smells like the sea. Ugh.
I&apos;m glad that your doubts have been put to rest, my undead friend. The last thing we need here is more... &lt;i&gt;unpleasantness&lt;/i&gt;.
Woke up this mornin&apos; in a sweat. Can&apos;t get that... thing... out of my mind.
I&apos;m Butter. Nice to meet you.
That&apos;s the spirit.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 3: The Divine
Oh, Sebille! We must speak. Too long do I keep silent. Too long do I wait. No more.
Anyway, you may leave me for the moment. We&apos;ll go over your duties once we reach Fort Joy. Now shoo.
[SCHOLAR] *Tap your head. Divinity revealed an archive of knowledge within you - and you can&apos;t wait to explore it.
Exploration Theme 06 Dark
[UNDEAD] *Sniff right back at her - aggressively, sarcastically. She&apos;s not exactly a rose garden.*
The Red Prince
All this cowering rubs me the wrong way. Time for these cowards to die a coward&apos;s death!
You - you, you, cannot come here. I am not done, I, I, I - *SNARL!*
The Red Prince&apos;s would-be assassins seem to have vanished. For now.
*Shout to the dog it has to get out of here - the ship is going to sink!*
Rat Die
I guess... that&apos;s that. Do you think it&apos;s true, what Malady said? That I&apos;ll never be rid of it now?
The ship snapped like kindling! That Voidwoken was quite impressive. Terrifying, but impressive.
Wolf Roar
Move along there.
You woke up and your world was gone. The last of your kind, you hide behind a charmed mask, searching for the truth about a history that no-one knew existed.
*No - it must have been the wind. The bony arm is lifeless between the rocks.*
*The child seems beside herself with sorrow and doesn&apos;t acknowledge you.*
*Nod your head. It&apos;s got to be Isbeil.*
Glad to have you with us, Prince, but I can&apos;t talk right now. If we don&apos;t figure out how to get this ship moving, we&apos;re dead.
*Tell Fane that you&apos;re sorry, You can&apos;t imagine what he&apos;s going through.*
Deflecting
*Believing it comes from her own mind, she realises the truth - she was murdered by Lucian the Divine. Raedalus too must be dead - or he would have come for her by now. She bows her head and cries.*
I am not certain that is true. I hope it is.
Hey, I know that face! Lord something or other... or something. Justinia&apos;s dad!
No lie, missus?
*He glares at you silently, a malevolent wisdom shining from his flickering parietal eyes.*
*...and the pain is gone. You are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; again. The spirit drops his arm to his side, dejected.*
That&apos;s just bloody lovely, that is! I hope you die of a long and horrible disease involving lots of pain and an appalling odour! Goddamned son of a swine!
In death I dream, Red Prince... Let me guide thee...
I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; you, remember?
White Necklace
*You look around at those who have accompanied you so far. In each one, something unique shines through.*
To the Lumberjack Magicians
*Say there must be some way to save him.*
*Tarquin understood the language spoken by the shard. Ask how that&apos;s possible.*
Incinerated Corpse
*He wiggles his unsheathed blade as if it were a child&apos;s toy.*
He lives in the big house by the gate. I ain&apos;t about to wander up and ask for a name, mind you.
[OUTLAW] *Draw your weapon. He has no idea just how unwelcome you can make yourself.*
Like I told them Magisters, yer can search the house all you want - the Sourcerer ain&apos;t here, the door&apos;s locked, and the house ain&apos;t even mine!
I am to meet the dreamer Stingtail at his shelter near the shore.
[BARBARIAN] *Sneer. If this is misery, she should see your childhood home.*
[1] has initiated a Ready Check.&lt;br&gt;Are you ready to move onto your next Adventure? You may be unable to come back?
*Thank her for the information and take your leave.*
*Ask Kemm to tell you about Arhu.*
*The spirit takes a deep breath and bellows silently...*
Current Music
Take my advice - get out of here.
*He looks at you a long moment. Suddenly, his blank, scarred face cracks into a mask of madness, his eyes bulging, his mouth open in a wide snarl baring blackened teeth. He bellows:*
You&apos;re talkin&apos; to me, not him, Saam.
Melee AI
Mooooooooooo!
Trophies will be disabled when playing with add-ons. Do you want to continue?
*Offer him some of the house stew.*
Your kin dies - for you and all of us. But you disrespect him. Leave me.
Stop following party
Well. You are right in that regard, at least.
Fireball
*Tell him you&apos;re keen to take the Godwoken to Roost: but where is he?*
May Zorl-Stissa ever watch over you.
I&apos;ll stop your play-acting, you smelly Sourcerer!
*Chuckles* Give them hell, Godwoken.
Sir honours me with his applause for my humble assessment.
Ain&apos;t no-one goin&apos; nowhere, far as you&apos;re concerned. Ain&apos;t no-one packin&apos; up and movin&apos; out of the city in a hurry. An&apos; that no-one ain&apos;t no dwarf. Geddit? Now go on, clear orf!
I am here to serve, Mistress. In this realm and any other, for as long as I must.
&lt;i&gt;...you are not enough... you were never enough...&lt;/i&gt;
Don&apos;t see many lizard-folk around out and about. They stick to Effie&apos;s Emporium. It&apos;s dark &apos;n&apos; damp down there, just the way they like it.
*But your mind, you suspect, is not. You lust for the man who lives next door. You covet his wife&apos;s fine dresses. You push these thoughts away - for you would run the Path of Blood, and for that you must be pure. To &lt;i&gt;win,&lt;/i&gt; you must be pure.*
*Shake your head. It isn&apos;t for you.*
[FANE] *Reach out to lay your hand against the carved stone. The Lady Amadia, whom you trusted above all others...*
*A shadow falls across her and you see a large, weeping face. She reaches out as if to comfort, but Braccus drags her back. You see her fall into the mire of the swamp, trapped.*
*Ask what she means.*
*Stare her down. Tell her you know she&apos;s hiding something. And you think you know what it is...*
*The spirit&apos;s resistance is strong. For a moment you feel like it will win - but you are stronger than the spirit, and suddenly its Source is yours.*
Effort_Sh_4
Ah, how sweet it is to have you in my arms once more. Safe and sound, right where you belong...
*Shrug and pay the requested toll.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
There was also some form of decaying shroud that aggravated Mihaly&apos;s wounds, but it appears to have dissipated. Small blessings...
The following items should first be published to Steam Workshop through the Divinity Editor:
I came back to see if I could help any others, but I got a sabre through the heart instead. *Spits* Murderin&apos; bluebloods. The Void&apos;s welcome to the lot of &apos;em.
You&apos;ll ace it. I&apos;m sure of that.
It&apos;s... it&apos;s a miracle!
*The gate guard stands to attention with the professionalism her royal uniform would demand. But when she speaks her voice quivers. Something has left her badly shaken.*
*Ask what makes her think you&apos;re a Sourcerer.*
Soiled Letter
Hmm. &apos;Isle of vaults&apos;, yada yadda yadda. &apos;Priest Surrey&apos;, and so on and so forth.
Oracle Palms
Profiles
Vrogir was large and strong as his orcs, Xantezza quick and witty as an imp, and Rhalic prone to bouts of fighting and boasting. Much like every human I&apos;ve ever encountered.
And I think it&apos;s time to start repaying the favours. I could fetch some stuff you need, maybe? Ma always said I was a great runner.
Bless his heart. I&apos;ve already sent word to him; he can rest his mind now. Micheil is no man of courage, but he&apos;s as loyal as a fresh-fed pup.
*Shake your head and ask what she means.*
&lt;i&gt;With the Source they stole from the Veil, the Seven created the races so they would have worshippers. &lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you won&apos;t fail him.*
Of course. You are no thief. No &lt;i&gt;Magister.&lt;/i&gt;
I think you should be on your way now.
Orc Tusk
*Unlike a butler, say.*
*All goes black for the briefest of moments, but when you come to, you see your own name grafted into your skin. Gone is the god&apos;s name. Only yours remains.*
*Accuse the rat of being an illusion.*
Goblin Trapper
*Say he&apos;d make a fine bard in any court. Now what about the other song?*
The bell rings no more. I&apos;ll away, with thanks. My sailing days are done, I&apos;ll to the Halls.
Meet with Baran Levere.
*You feel an overwhelming sense that she&apos;s at attention, listening to the gentle thrum of your pulse. Suddenly, a shudder passes through the rhythm.*
Your kind belongs in prison. Come on, let&apos;s get moving.
Civil Ability points
It&apos;s not too late, you know. You could still accept the Covenant. You could still join Him - join me - in eternal life. But you won&apos;t, will you? You&apos;re too much of a coward.
There y&apos;go, Dot. Listen to the nice lady.
Spirit of Auntie Flann
*Confront her. How could she take so much joy from inflicting cruelty?*
*The blinding force of the flames pushes you back, driving you away from the glade, away from the vision, and away from the altar.*
*Her kisses go lower still. Your belly, and below. Her tongue right there. That delightful pressure, again and again.*
Little girl, little girl.
I told you to stop it once already. Consider this your last warning.
Why would you do that? Help!
Die_Magic_Fire_1
She&apos;s close to you, along Reaper&apos;s Coast. There&apos;s a camp to the north; it&apos;s where I was headed before the House of Shadows caught up with me.
Dungeon or daylight, it does not matter... I am immortal... Immortally bound...
*As the soul spills from the jar, the arm in your bag revolts. It clambers out and falls to the floor.*
TARGET DUMMY
Bloody Obsidian Lancet
Come on! Lemme out!
*Her face contorts, the uncovered half going sallow, demonic, lined with ridges along the bones and flames beneath the skin. Suddenly, it goes totally lax.*
*Ask Geraldine what&apos;s in this secret stash.*
*Ask what&apos;s on his mind.*
To identify, use an identifying glass and select the item you want to identify. To examine a monster or NPC, select them and choose Examine.
As well you should! I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like dwarves, for instance.
You bring me hope, friend! I&apos;ll gather the other Seekers and travel to shore. Meet us there, as soon as you can. Just be sure to have Leya remove that collar of yours first. It doesn&apos;t suit you.
[VILLAIN] *Offer your sympathy. Perhaps he&apos;d have better luck siding with the Void?*
*The spirit looses the arrow. It evaporates into nothing against your skin. No pain... though a shiver runs up your arm...*
*He lowers his head and turns towards the young boy&apos;s corpse.*
*Tell them you are not here to talk. You are here for the Aeteran.*
Better to take them out now.
Vulture&apos;s Wing
*You look into a skeletal face. Rotten meat still drips from its bones. You reach out to it, fitting the creature with an ornate mask...*
*Say you really don&apos;t have time for this. Better to get a move on.*
