Possess
I touched nothing. Was touched by nothing. The greatest horrors and heroism were no more than footnotes to me.
Torture Mechanisms
Nothing yet, madam... the Black Ring captive you executed was the only one who knew how to operate it...
I can&apos;t force you to do the obviously correct thing; I can only tell you that once you&apos;ve made the decision to face him without my help, you&apos;re quite on your own in the matter.
You&apos;re an unexpected visitor. We can&apos;t do business unless you pay the man downstairs.
*Take a step away from him. Ask what happened here.*
But I do, &lt;i&gt;Master&lt;/i&gt;, with the heat of a million suns.
Item Name
*Frown. You are an Eternal, what further requirements could there be possibly be?*
*It may be pointless, but you push back against the claw. You strain and sweat, but you damn well keep pushing back.*
*The woman stares into the far distance, gently rocking back and forth.*
*A dreamy smile spreads across her face.*
Noxious Void Salamander
*Imagine the honeyed voice turning to poison in your mind. Use the thought to resist.*
Almost there - a little longer!
Yit Koor
You! You&apos;re a comrade of the brave soul who&apos;s to retrieve my supplies - isn&apos;t that right? So? What&apos;s the word?
It&apos;s a bit on the tall side for my liking.
Mordus is dead. We should bring back proof to Lohar.
She made a deal with some mighty dark forces and now she&apos;s lookin&apos; for a way out.
*Nod. Does he know a way?*
True enough, but all in good time. She needs to rest now. Settle into herself again.
Not interested in the son of the Divine himself? Ha, I don&apos;t blame you one bit... but Vik here&apos;ll blow a blood vessel if he hears you talking like that.
Explode target corpse, dealing physical damage in the area.
no new Divine had risen.
Do not look at me like that. I said it was &lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt;, not easy. Now get to the Magisters&apos; barracks and find that list! You no longer have the luxury of time.
*Ask about Rosewood.*
*Gesture to the Sourcerer. While the Magister was babbling, her prisoner was trying to escape.*
Are you creatures really so deeply insecure? Good heavens.
Divine&apos;s Lament
Do as I say, Lohse.
I blame Damian for this. Lucian never should have taken him in.
Owlmistress Aoife:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We bring word from the east, from the deserts of Mezd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spice trade is flourishing this year, and the tented stalls are filled with jewelled fruits and honeyed ales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We read of the difficulties in the Arx environs with pity and hope that your troubles will be allayed soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wishing you the bounty of the sun, and the protection of the moon,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acquillah bat-Mezd
No spirits here either. All purged.
*A vision appears. It wavers, then becomes clear. In the reddish light cast by flowing lava, you see a cave. You recognise it - this is the Sallow Man&apos;s cave. The roof has fallen in. Nothing there lives.*
Undead almost got me on the way in. Had to kick his head right off to get free. Put my foot through his skull and, well...
Your flesh isn&apos;t worthy of the steel of my blade, but by all the dead gods, it&apos;ll just have to set aside its pride!
Ha. HA! HAHAHA! They don&apos;t involve me, do they? Think again: What you do involves all the realm.
As the new Mother, Sebille founded a new elven homeland. Elves flocked to her, and she became a demigoddess. Sebille swore never to kill again. But when the demons went to war, her needle would draw blood once more.
*Fane tosses the book over his shoulder. It flutters in the air as it sails over the ship&apos;s railing and disappears with a faint &apos;splash&apos;.*
Elixir Mixer
Our search for Godwoken&apos;s at a standstill. Those Shriekers Dallis deployed at the shore - they&apos;ve grounded us. We&apos;ll overcome though, as long as I have steel in my hand and Lucian in my heart!
The ravenous Weaver will reward us for flesh. Three more limbs, to be exact.
Driftwood. Old master. Hot heels. Got it.
You nobody.
Poison
&lt;i&gt;No more games. Only liberty.&lt;/i&gt;
*He looks deep into your eyes and sees... &lt;i&gt;something.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Before you stands a shrine to Amadia, her solemn face carved of ancient stone.*
Then why, pray tell, are you wasting time? You may have eternity, but Rivellon does not!
This yellow fish is the last, eh, &lt;i&gt;sample &lt;/i&gt;that I wish to study for now... if you care to do the honours...
*Respond with &apos;The House of Pleasure&apos;.*
Hold [IE_PanelSelect] and point [LeftStick] in the direction of the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;equipment&lt;/font&gt; panel to open it.
And who would&apos;ve thought it? You&apos;re sure not the collared landlubber I first met, that&apos;s for sure! You belong to Rivellon now. You and that... demon, I guess.
*Tell him you&apos;ll do everything you can.*
*The spirit of a man looks around, distraught and confused. He doesn&apos;t notice you.*
Move along then - I&apos;m behind in my duties.
Savage Axe
I love you too.
*Say that you&apos;ll do the right thing - you&apos;ll save the world with those powers, as you&apos;re supposed to.*
I proclaim thee the Champion of the Driftwood arena! Get yer gloat on, &apos;n&apos; take a swig of ale. Hell, take a dozen. We&apos;ll be singin&apos; for years to come of the great Void-slayer!
Don&apos;t say that! It&apos;s beautiful!
*Turn away. You&apos;ve done all you can.*
*Tell her Amyro asked you to bring a token back to her people, so that they might come and rescue her.*
You will pay!
*Sacrifice two Source points to the device.*
However, Lady Kemm may not appreciate fielding questions from someone of your, eh, &lt;i&gt;unrefined &lt;/i&gt;stature. I trust you won&apos;t take offence - nobility must adhere to protocol.
I agree. You and he have long been on the road; I suppose you trust one another. The God King must burn, so under your joint command let our child be the all-consuming fire!&lt;br&gt;
*Tell him to get the hell away from that body!*
*The Paladin presses a wad of fresh bandages upon a steadily-bleeding leg wound. For a moment, it seems to work... but then, the bleeding suddenly gets &lt;i&gt;worse.*&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm? Oh. Yeah. I know. Your buddies came with a full report...
Setting you free was my own cowardly act. This ends, right here and right now.
You&apos;ve never heard of Her Royal Highness, Princess Zenthia of the Firelands?!
Does this look like my workshop? What are you waiting for?
*Tell Ifan you did what you thought best for Rivellon.*
Crusher
*The hatch is firmly locked.*
Alright, I&apos;ll allow your presence in Lord Arhu&apos;s chambers at this point in time. Please be mindful of the Lord&apos;s belongings. Do not give me a reason to change my mind.
You can&apos;t go in there, mister. The Meistr isn&apos;t home an&apos; the Magisters locked her house up for her.
Explode, dealing [1] in a large area around you, creating an Acid surface.
AHEM!
Mashetou na-pathen, sh&apos;danilou! Caomail s&apos;aravel, damerail s&apos;aravel!
*It might seem like a bad time, but ask the dwarf if she could remove your Source collar.*
Target is out of sight!
FreeCamera Rotate Mouse Right
Far be it from me to criticise, but were these truly what passes for &apos;heroes&apos; in this world?
*Siva&apos;s face freezes, her eyes burning. You&apos;d swear her spirit&apos;s form flickered, threatening to lose its shape before she regained control.*
Kemm? Well why didn&apos;t you say so? Go on.
It&apos;s a shame, it is. An absolute shame.
Only, I never intended to make it through this alive. And now, neither will you...
You... you... you &lt;i&gt;ate &lt;/i&gt;the eggy baby? HENS! PECK!
*Dizziness. It lasts just a moment - but long enough for you to feel the demon&apos;s presence. You hear no words, yet understand: it&apos;s imperative you accept Ryker&apos;s bargain.*
As am I. A prince should die of old age or on the battlefield. Anything else could be construed as weakness of character.
I also see you are not yet... whole.
*He mentioned barrels. Ask if he knows about the marked barrel at the shore.*
[LOHSE] *You&apos;ve got to be kidding me. He deals with demons?*
Royal Fire Slug
I... I saw. I saw, I saw. I saw - BACAW! - I saw...
At the sawmill, the spirit of a mage murdered by a Lone Wolf asked us to avenge him.
*Tell him to go right ahead. What&apos;s the worst that could happen?*
*Cough*
*Look inside and bark at the thing to stop. You don&apos;t want to hurt this elf. It can&apos;t make you.*
Oh, do I?! Why yes, yes I do!
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there, shorty. Jonathan&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt he&apos;ll be caring much who or what he slices.
As will I.
*The traitor himself - the Divine you once selflessly served, the one you thought dead - lords over the chamber from a granite throne. He moves to speak, but it&apos;s Vredeman&apos;s voice that next pierces the air.*
The lock&apos;s melting away! Mordus turned the key into an amulet. Cunning...
Malady&apos;s Beacon
They&apos;re kind though. Magisters kicked &apos;em something fierce, but still they gave me water and bread and shelter when I needed it.
ruled over by by the Sworn and the Eternals.
Got no reason to scramble out, me. S&apos;hot and busy out there. S&apos;cool and quiet in here. Or at least, it &lt;i&gt;used &lt;/i&gt;to be.
The third Passion of Lucian. Hubert Oak&apos;s brushwork is unmistakeable!
*Shrug. You&apos;ve fought a fair few, but it was no big deal, really.*
Explore the Hall of Echoes.
The servants, they got nothing up there. Ryker has it all now.
Weep, my friends, for Alexandar the Innocent...
*Wonder what he plans to do next.*
Were it not for the princess.
Oh, but I did.
*Tell her to shut the hell up or you&apos;ll cut her head off.*
&lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Move&lt;/font&gt; objects by clicking and dragging them.
Phew. I was afraid I was going to have to smack you upside your nut, there.
*Squint. What the hell is he talking about?*
Get away from my chest.
*Tell her you can both escape through the back.*
Still going east? Pick another, that&apos;s my advice.
We ventured on, leaving Sanders behind us.
Open the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;party radial menu&lt;/font&gt;, highlight a party member, and press [IE_Interact] to select. Then select another party member in the same way and press [IE_ActionMenu] to group them.
HehehehehEHEHEHEHEHEEE... BOOM!!!

*Continue to listen.*

Magister&apos;s Twohander
Good god, that is NOT something I like to see.
*Say that perhaps she owes you divinity...*
It&apos;s just-... that thing you did with your tongue. It was... quite unexpected.
Ballista
There&apos;s a Lone Wolf named Zaleskar out in the Hollow Marshes. I&apos;d like to interrogate him.
You damn fool. Every second wasted is a second he could use to escape. Next time, have something worth reporting.

GARVAAAAN!
That metaphor works, right? I&apos;m goin&apos; with a &apos;yes&apos;.
From the desk of Her Ladyship, Dallis, Right Hand to Bishop Alexandar, Son of the Divine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To our brave troops in Fort Joy,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be warned: A tediously bothersome, but not altogether disorganised, group of rebels calling themselves &apos;Seekers&apos; have set their eyes on some of our Sourcerers. They may or may not have facilitated the escape of at least two &lt;i&gt;special&lt;/i&gt; ones, and you are forewarned to be on high alert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If any so-called &apos;Seekers&apos; are found, they are to be delivered to my person directly for a treatment I and only I may administer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mistakes and mis-steps will NOT be tolerated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-D
He would never stop seeking.
*The spirit shivers and shimmies - and then is gone to the Hall, relieved of his mortal pain and penitence.*
You are pure - you can be my champion.

I have lost a husband. And I fear I may lose a son, too.
Lucian&apos;s tears, DeSelby, what have you done?
