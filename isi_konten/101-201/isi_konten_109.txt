An unwise decision, but not, I suppose, one that&apos;s mine to make. I only hope for the world&apos;s sake you know what you&apos;re doing. If not, let the world prepare for its inevitable end.
Justinia&apos;s father. They say he died a natural death. Of course, for a man in his position, it&apos;s only natural to get murdered.
*Ask the elven spirit how he died.*
This Griff is nothing but a thug. Don&apos;t give up Stingtail so easily.
*Lower your head and tell him you&apos;re promised to another.*

Lucky Charm
Allow? I did not &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; this. As I am quite sure you did not choose any number of indignities in your own life... least of all your presence on this hellish isle.
Yeh think I give a donkey&apos;s neigh for everyone? There were &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;person in the world for me to protect and she - and I - *sobs* oh Divine save us...
It&apos;s time. Kindle the flames; hatch my dragon!
Acid Spore
*Gareth softly pokes the listless man&apos;s torso with his foot.*
The Joy? I&apos;ve heard a lot. Nothing good. No surprise there, since Bishop Alexandar runs the show.
We broke the seal of the Blazing Sculpture, granting us access into a hidden vault.
Tools of the Godwoken: Spirit Vision
*Her companions reach out and grasp the spear, ready to plunge it into Sarias&apos;s heart.*
*Just a tease. Slowly she moves back up, her body close to you, her lips against your ear.*
Darling! There you are!&lt;br&gt;
*Rotate the dial to the left.*
*Ask where you should start the search.*
[BARBARIAN] *Point to your sheathed weapon. If he&apos;s so interested in the dead, he could always join them.*
*Beast&apos;s fearful rage consumes him. He unsheathes his weapon with a roar and charges toward the Doctor, who grins at the sight - then takes a defensive stance.*
*Lohse inhales sharply.*
[FANE] *Growl that she is no mother to you. You are an Eternal, like her, not some mewling mortal.*
*Isbeil clears her throat and the compliments continue.*
Bock, bock, bock, bock, bock, BACAW!
Murder!
Away from me, demon slave.
*Say you haven&apos;t had the chance to ask who they are.*
[SEBILLE] *Gesture to your own face and say that you know the evils of living scars - the ship is free.*
Indented Twohander
Forest - River Bridge A
He was convinced that great ancient knowledge lay in this land. Greater intellects than mine? The fool&apos;s madness knew no bounds.
But first things first.
Still alive? Gods above, there might be something to you after all.
*Dallis looks to you...*
Ours has been a story for the ages, hasn&apos;t it. You were nothing but a two-bit minstrel playing host to a carousel of visitors, and I was... well. I was doing quite well. But now, I&apos;m even better.
*Tell him you&apos;d have done the same.*
*The Magister looks at you sideways. She laughs and laughs and laughs some more.*
*He composes herself and draws his weapon.*
We found a massive dragon&apos;s skull inside a cave. There&apos;s enough space to fit something inside.
*Rush forward and try to help her up.*
Most unusual. And, if it is not too rude to suggest, not much of an answer.
*Note that she is of neither the Black Ring or the Divine Order - who is she?*
We dug up a talkative skeleton. His claims to be a philosopher of some wisdom are less than convincing.
*Ask if it&apos;s usual for... creatures like itself to have royalty.*
Magister Pavlonia. &lt;i&gt;Charmed&lt;/i&gt; to meet you, I&apos;m sure.
*Suggest that releasing the Mistake may allow the spirit to leave for the Halls.*
So, you&apos;ve, uh... changed your mind?
*Big Marge&apos;s spirit pecks and pecks at you. It causes no physical pain, but you can feel her beak pecking at your very soul. Peck, peck, &lt;i&gt;peck.*&lt;/i&gt;
Unless the nightmare is his.
One more word from you, and I shall use the leash.
Is that what I am to you? Manpower?
*Alright. Agree to open the chest.*
Rocks ahead, Cap&apos;n! Avast! Hard a-port! Ha! Rocks ahead! Do you hear me, Cap&apos;n?! Hahahahaha! I&apos;m ringing the bell! Turn the ship, &apos;fore it&apos;s too late! Hahahahaha!
Cursed Electric Infusion Skillbook
*Croakle.*
*Not even a flicker of a smile crosses his stern face.*
Model Quality:
I think we should go home. Come on, Ben. Thank you, mister. Bye-bye.
Yes... A newfound silence; sweet absence of agony. The thousand teeth are gone, gnawing at the mind and heart.
Patience. You must prove yourself worthy of such answers.
The thing is, I can never be free. The queen can&apos;t be trusted to rule unchecked. So I must choose the dwarven people&apos;s liberty... in exchange for my own.
*Note that he&apos;s hardly human anymore. Whatever happened to him destroyed his mind as well as his body.*
Heavy Storm
A story longer than you care to hear.
*Say that you have to try and save him.*
*Shake your head to yourself - words are no use here.*
Aye, you&apos;re right about that! But it ain&apos;t to last. I&apos;m not a free man anymore. I belong to Rivellon now.
[ELF] *Say you haven&apos;t been home in a long time. You wouldn&apos;t know.*
There is a tangible aura of goodness and light radiating from this otherwise ordinary-seeming barrel.
The locals liked and respected Almira - she never wanted for help, and deals always fell to her favour.
I like Gareth. Really, I do. But he took his path and I took mine. I know what I see. I see a world burning. And it&apos;s Sourcerers lighting the fires.
Let&apos;s go. We&apos;ve wasted enough time here.
Reimond,&lt;br&gt;I had hoped that this letter would prove unnecessary, but I am still awaiting news about the fate of the Peacemaker. I want details. I had thought I had made that quite clear by now. If I have to fit a trip to Driftwood into my schedule, I&apos;ll be most displeased.&lt;br&gt;Lady Dallis, the Hammer
*Scowl. Griff was a thug and a tyrant. You&apos;ve no fond words to impart.*
You understand. You work to provide a home for those who need it. This place is just such a home!
*Tell her she&apos;s... something.*
Got bows and arrows, if you need &apos;em.

The Shadow Prince is dead. The Red Prince is free of his meddling.
*Ask Leya if she could take off your collar.*
*Remark that you would have thought the renowned Lord Arhu would be strong enough to escape any situation.*
*Smiles.* Not quite, my dear. Not quite...
That&apos;s Beast nowadays, friend! That other name - long left that behind, I did.
In any event, it&apos;s our business. Not yours. You just stay well away from the door and you&apos;ll be perfectly safe.
I have no doubt. The potential within you is... tremendous.
I&apos;ll never feel clean again.
Escape this floating prison.
*Say you don&apos;t believe a word of their lies.*
A mask that was stolen by that damn witch after her little &apos;scene&apos;.
In the centre of the dream, Your Majesty. In the sunset eye of the dragon.
*He pauses, reddening slightly as he looks at you curiously.*
This is not a realm in need of saving. Ours is:
Hrrm, well if Sister Avenny says so... very well, you may proceed. But don&apos;t keep Lord Arhu from his business any longer than necessary!
*Narrow your eyes. It seems a bit of a stretch to accuse someone just because they&apos;re new in town...*
*Nod fastidiously. Damned humans, and their dreams of gilded robes and opulent castles...*
*Burp!* Cheers to you, me, and... and...
*The spirit throws a look of disgust at you.*
In the meantime, let&apos;s keep a lower profile...
*Remark on the sturdiness of the cell bars. The prisoner&apos;s not going anywhere.*
*The spirit gazes through you as you pull the Source from his very soul. He is calm, and this calmness is terrifyingly, infinitely cold. Chittering, the whispers of the Void creep around the edges of his Source.*
*She looks around at the stone walls of her room. Then takes a step towards you.*
Electrical currents are empowering the automaton.
to recover the divine powers Dallis had snatched away
I don&apos;t know how this could happen. Who would have seen it coming?
Volatile Voidling
*He bucks again and fights against you... and then, after a moment, he dies.*
What can yet be blessed can yet be restored. One way or another, divinity will survive, through all of you, and all of &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
Two-Handed Axe
Sssssay, lookie look lookie... a &lt;i&gt;champion&lt;/i&gt;. Good for my belly, good for my happinessssssss...
*Despite your efforts, the bones won&apos;t budge.*

*Ask if he wants to team up.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve always been a bit afraid of her, but you like her all the same.*
Magister Viktar there used to entertain me with tales of terror about the place. But it looks like I&apos;ve got the jump on him... for the moment, anyway.
*The guard curtly nods.*
*Tell her you&apos;re kidding. You&apos;re just cranky today. A lot going on.*
Beggar
Ask around.
Grants skill: [1]
*Give him a solid punch in the arm. Nice tune - it truly captures your viciousness!*
Bah - at least the vital components have withstood the onslaught. Tell me, do you require further knowledge?
The captain confronted us and demanded that we return his armour.
Naughty lizards!
Blue Fabric Dye
*You can take it, you &lt;i&gt;deserve&lt;/i&gt; to suffer. Look deeper into Rhalic&apos;s eyes.*
Sister Schori
*What did &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;do? Ask why anyone would want you dead.*
My mother certainly thought so.
Chop chop!
*Ask about these monsters.*
Their vile magic lured the Voidwoken.
I was wrong. About power, I mean. Was always kiddin&apos; myself that I could only help my people if I were free - lead &apos;em by example, y&apos;know?
It takes a little while to kick in. See me when you&apos;re in Driftwood, I&apos;ll sort you out for recipes.
*Ask her to tell you honestly - are you her thrall? Would you even know it if you were...?*
*She takes her leave.*
*Say you&apos;d like to discover what he sees in his dreams after all.*

Spirit of a Magister
Spirit of Gye Fallchard
*The dwarf suddenly drifts back into view, peering at you with fascination.*
Divine... bless... you...
This Sourcerer, my friend, is as powerful as they come. Patience is part of the job. I won&apos;t risk a Voidwoken attack until I have to - and the longer the Sourcerer stays where she is, the weaker she gets.
Meat Golem Thug
You are Godwoken. I was told Godwoken would want to get into the tomb. I was also told I should make sure that doesn&apos;t happen...
Maybe it is in my blood as well.
Here&apos;s the key - oh... it&apos;s gone. Perhaps it fell out here somewhere. Take a look around if you like, it might be worth your while.
Chilling Amulet
You failure.
Magical Chain Pants
*Tell him this has gone on long enough. Why don&apos;t you just put him out of his misery already.*
Look at it! Isn&apos;t it magnificent? A tiny titan ready to burst forth with unstoppable force.
&lt;i&gt;Back away from the door.&lt;/i&gt;
*He gives you but a sneer, then turns back to the real focus of his hate.*
&lt;i&gt;Voidwoken! &lt;/i&gt;The Sourcerer&apos;s conjured Voidwoken! Form up - don&apos;t let them over the bridge!
*Ask the spirit who he is, and how he came to be here.*
*Scoff at her alligator tears.*
True or not, it makes no difference. I did what I did. And my people suffered for it.
*&apos;Dallis&apos; gives you a steady look, cool and collected. This is your daughter. You are her father.*
*Smile and say that sounds wonderful.*
A Girl and Her Demon
Well, you can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you!
We came across a screaming Magister in the Blackpits.
*Say goodbye.*
