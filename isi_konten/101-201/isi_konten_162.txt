Hmm... My way is too small for you. You&apos;ll have to find another. Hope you brought a shovel!
You showed those Magister what&apos;s what, you did. Shame ya got thrown int&apos;a the Joy, but ain&apos;t that just like the Beast of legend t&apos; sacrifice his own freedom for his posse&apos;s?
No entry. Back off.
Whaddya after.
*Disagree. Without knowing what the sacrifice was for, you can&apos;t say it was unforgivable.*
I don&apos;t know. Maybe? I never felt it before, so it&apos;s hard for me to say. But I can tell ya my insides feel quivery, like a big tub o&apos; blueberry jam.
*Repress the struggling creature within and ask what&apos;s hiding behind that mask.*

She&apos;s right there, my prince. Cross the threshold. Pass through the iron door behind me.
Goodbye.

There y&apos;go, Dot. Listen to the nice fellow.
An old bunch of papers about grenades. It urges the reader to experiment with &apos;unusual suspects&apos;, such as glass shards, and elemental essences, such as fire. Good advice.
The Knight of Duna is dead.
Oh, Safa. Too inebriated to keep her lips tight; not inebriated enough to slip into blackness. Then let us skip the niceties. I can fulfil your... greatest desire.
*Express your remorse. You simply wanted to end their endless lingering.*
*Gareth stretches out an arm in front of him and takes inventory of every scrape, cut and bruise.*
But...
It was my duty. My duty to guide our new Divine.
After all, what is a warrior without his sight? Give me yours. I assure you, it will be put to good use in the war against the Void.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell her you know all too well how surreal absolute adulation can feel.*
I won&apos;t forget you either. Good-bye.
*Rest your hand on his shoulder. You&apos;ll do everything you can to find a cure.*
Well go right on in! The Beast o&apos; the Sea&apos;s got a standing pass to Effie&apos;s Emporium, courtesy of Papa Thrash!
Ain&apos;t you getting tired of it, though? Same contract, over and over. How many of &apos;em can there be.
Ball. Ball. Ball. Me next. Ball. Bruno! Ball?
*The spirit continues his vigil over the fallen.*
*The pain you inflict on her is real - but she realises that it will soon be at an end. She gives herself to you - *
Hmmm? What? You be needin&apos; something from me, lad? Ain&apos;t much inclined to rub elbows with lizards if you catch my drift.
If you say so. Move along, and do not stir up more trouble.
*Ask how all these Voidwoken got here in the first place.*
People are going to perish. People are going to die and I can&apos;t stop it.
*The spirit leans in close.*
Th... &lt;i&gt;thanks.&lt;/i&gt;
*Focus on his rage.*
*Tell Grog that you spoke to Marg and you&apos;re here to give him a chance to increase his offer.*
You returned to the world as one more human among many. Your future was yours to decide. Did you accept your new status with humility, or did you rebel?
Travel
Seen my share, ain&apos;t I.

*Say you prefer the company of sentient beings.*
And there&apos;s no telling if they&apos;re through with us yet. We can&apos;t count on a... a voice to save us again.
It&apos;s one way to be sure of killing your enemies.
*Laugh. She really thinks you&apos;d help a Magister? Someone who&apos;s keeping you under lock and key?*
Glory to the God King and all who serve Him -
Must be an awful lot of fun toys to be had at a sawmill.
Look. His bones lie buried in our sacred soil. But his spirit... his spirit... his spirit remains. Find him. Take from him what he takes from me. I show you where. Find him.
*As the tears dampen your fingertips, the stone face seems to smile sadly at you for just a moment. Maybe you imagined it? Perhaps it was a trick of the light?*
&lt;i&gt;Go!&lt;/i&gt;
The Mother congratulates you on your choice. Now please. Bring her the heart of the lizard prince, hiding out in the shadows. You will be well rewarded.
*Interject and ask the elf what is happening.*
Come closer. &lt;i&gt;I dare you.&lt;/i&gt;
No, your highness, it cannot be! O, how your words darken the day! The mother of dragons... dead. Truly this world is coming to an end.
&lt;i&gt;*Tell him that someone even more powerful than Tir-Cendelius will soon rise...*&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I am victorious.&lt;/i&gt;
She made her choice the second she swore herself to the God King. Strike her down!

You&apos;ve stepped in  &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;oil&lt;/font&gt;. Oil surfaces can slow you down and can also be ignited. &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Every&lt;/font&gt; surface has its own effects.
Even now she hides one of my spores. She wants its secrets. I give them to her.&lt;br&gt;
Out beyond the bridge, the world has gone to hell. We can&apos;t help you, I&apos;m afraid, we are too few.

The defroculurter and the Source parade? Oh. No. I&apos;m afraid I missed that. Please, do what you must. I will leave you to it.
This can&apos;t be happening.

*Doubt crosses his face as he realises he&apos;s stuck here forever, and there are no more jokes to make...*

You once engaged in a game of hypothetical strategy during a banquet many years ago. You were asked to shed light on the most inscrutable of conundrums. So you did.
This wand whistles delicately if you wave it in the air - the song of one at home with the wind.
There can be a way. Amyro knows! But he is gone. Do you see him? He knows how to leave.
Ah, a gentle one: shy and intense?
It is &lt;i&gt;super&lt;/i&gt;natural! Do not heed me or any other, only your own lust for power, just like a god should!
Maddening Stare

Don&apos;t rush off darling... maybe we could get a little better acquainted, heh...
&lt;i&gt;Most&lt;/i&gt; of us, anyway.
I do not need &apos;luck&apos;, I have Divine truth on my side.

There she is. What a beaut!
