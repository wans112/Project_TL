It was Gareth that brought him to us. Karon. The first Godwoken the Seekers found. He ate our food. He enjoyed our fellowship. We nurtured him and taught him.
You can&apos;t just... just use people like that. Whatever possessed them, we&apos;re going to find it and teach it just that.
That is &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;for you to interfere with. Am I making myself quite clear?
Lucian made amends to the elves -
*Say: &apos;First.&apos;*
[VILLAIN] *Ask which part she&apos;s having trouble believing - the bit where she killed her friends, or where she fed Sourcerers to monsters?*
*He smiles shyly as you break off the kiss, but you notice a look in his eyes.*
Somewhere further inland Roost Anlon breathes. All I have to do now is pick up his scent and make his last breath worth my while.
with friends visibility
Mysterious Orders
*Relent. You remember him, of course. Who could forget Laslor &apos;The Lungs&apos; Lorrian?*
*Tell her you are expendable - the Paladins are not. You are willing to chance death, if it means making this wench talk.*
*Tell her you have killed Lord Arhu.*
Because the God King is our &lt;i&gt;true lord and saviour&lt;/i&gt; - he&apos;s going to right the wrongs of the Seven. Not that I&apos;d expect some gold-hungry Lone Wolf to understand...
Churl And Chuff
The ritual took me to the Hall of Echoes, where my god sought refuge in my soul. Gifted with Spirit Vision, I can now speak with the dead.
*The squirrel lays his hand on you and a strange feeling ripples through your body: a sense of power. Your mind opens to the possibilities of new magic.*
Creatures
*Say you&apos;re doing fine on your own, thanks anyway.*
The God King restores the injured, resurrects the fallen... I lay dead and forgotten until he brought me back. He rewards the loyal.
Those Magisters are going to pay. I want to see some guts spilled for what they did to us.
*The squirrel nods as you leave and continues to run his hands over his friend&apos;s skeleton with long, slow, caring strokes.*
I wonder when the light will return. Outside is as grim as this hold...
No, they are working quite adequately. It seems you are at fault. Predictable, really.
I don&apos;t know! But there&apos;s something wrong, and it&apos;s underneath the floor.
*Tell her she should be more respectful. The Eternals are back!*
I-I can&apos;t salvage the luggage wi-without my husband. But if you can, you are welcome to it.
Baran&apos; awaits me in the Black Bull tavern. I wonder if I&apos;m still barred, after what happened the last time.
*Corbin, the fletcher you rescued from Roost Anlon at the Cullwood Mills, sparks to life at the sight of you and breaks into a great grin.*
*Seize back control and ask about this &apos;Aeteran&apos;. It might help in the fight against the Void.*
Not grateful. Just tolerant.
Have you forgotten your own journey, Marcus? I know you love your people. I know you would see them free. But I must be the one to face them. To release them from the prison I made for them.
Barin Pruitt
*Say that you seek the Council of Seven - does she know how to access it?*
Then the mutiny ends here!
Door&apos;s open. Go on in.
Incarnate Champion
I really... I... I need to stay until it&apos;s sorted. Thank you.
Your vision has been restored, giving you the power to see spirits - the souls of dead mortals made manifest in Source.
Come no further!
*Ask: A big bad wolf?*
A hero? I followed orders.
That&apos;s all I know. I swear.
Such a pity that the stories that arise from the Rivellonian rubble will tell not of a saviour but of a sinner.
*He stands over Alexandar and stabs him seven times. When the deed is done, Alexandar lies lifeless. Ifan stands trembling, his hands covered in the blood of the Divine&apos;s only son.*
[NOBLE] *Tell her you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; interested. Good bodyguards are hard to find.*
*He looks tired; his brow is wet with sweat.*
Find a socket for the gemstone eye.
*You do not lie: you belong to the Black Ring squad that tried to cross the river.*
*A thought suddenly enters your mind, though you&apos;re quite certain it isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;yours.&lt;/i&gt; You hear the voice of Duna in your head: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Do as she says.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*With clear reluctance, the captain strips off his enchanted clothes, tossing them in a pile at your feet. He rips the soul jar out of your hands, observing its greenish glow.*
It&apos;s Amadia, the mother of wizards.
*Slowly close up the wound.*
*Demand he identify himself. How does he know you?*
*Ask how he feels about his King.*
[ELF] Lucian did worse, and his reputation seemed to survive just fine.
After the exorcism failed, I felt... empty. Blind. The only thing I could still see was you. Only you.
I got people to maintain. You help me, I help you. Simple as that.
C&apos;mon! Please, Lohse!
Who are you?
Of course not! I have a sacred duty to carry, for the betterment of Rivellon. Besides, if he was so innocent, he shouldn&apos;t have ran away in the first place.
Hotter than the fires of hell and twice as lethal, lava will burn you to a crisp right where you stand.
*It takes you a moment to realise the egg you&apos;ve been carrying has hatched at long last. The chick trills contentedly and flaps its tiny feathers in recognition of its proud parent. It seems you&apos;ve got a new mouth to feed!*
Guards! Kill this one! Burn him to ashes!
*Reach for it.*
Target Cycling
Now, if you&apos;ve done your part and killed the single person you were meant to, our business will be done. I trust you have his will.
Magister Pyromancer
If you are ready to meet your fate, &lt;i&gt;my chosen&lt;/i&gt;, I am ready to forgive your insolence.
Every citizen of Arx gets at least one invitation to tea every year. We all deserve a taste of luxury from time to time, do we not? I may live in a resplendent mansion, but I still &lt;i&gt;share&lt;/i&gt; my riches, one lucky guest at a time.
Hail, my good man. Bringing excellent word?
Necro-Wing Voidwoken
To atone for my sins in this world I spent the rest of my days taking care of the sick and elderly.
[DWARF] *Slap her on the back like an old friend. You had an invitation - you&apos;re sure of it!*
Granting the power that you need, Godwoken! The gift that I have proffered is free, but it is not without a cost. All things exist in balance, so your gain must mean a loss to another.
Oh, wonderful! It&apos;s like I always said: everyone&apos; got a melody in &apos;em - ya just gotta look. Me brother Laslor couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket when he was a wee thing. Now, he&apos;s got the voice of an angel.
Oh my. Just &lt;i&gt;adorable&lt;/i&gt;, you are. I dare say you&apos;ll enjoy this story.
&apos;cause you&apos;re a Master. Master sent us here. Me and Ma and Pa. She was not a nice lady. Lizards aren&apos;t nice ladies. They beat me.
Bock?! BOCK! BOCK!
Perhaps you&apos;re right. For all I know, you could be a half-breed, too. Though I don&apos;t smell the blood of a demon in you. A god, more like.
Everyone else on the island is chaff. Toss them away when you&apos;re done with them.
No cave for you! Any closer and I crack your skull and slurp your brains - understand?
Spare us coin. Grant us coin. The more you pay, the further the Path Keeper takes us.
Glad I branded ya wrong. Anythin&apos; more ya wantin&apos; to know?
&lt;i&gt;Yyyou&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;not one of those blood &lt;i&gt;ttthings &lt;/i&gt;- who are &lt;i&gt;yyyou?! &lt;/i&gt;
You get immunity to fire, but lowered resistance to water. You bleed fire.
It isn&apos;t Lohse I&apos;m travelling with, but whatever is lurking within.
Spirit of Geraldine
Oh! Well, hello there!
*Ask about what dangers lie ahead.*
Whatever. Jus&apos; wanted to remind you of where things stand.
*He shakes his head and walks away.*
Really? You think now is the time for a heart-to-figurative-heart?
Gods, fine. Take it and go, and if you say a word about this to Julian or anyone else...
*Examine the first candle.*
Paladin Warin Farrimand
[LOHSE] *Say you aren&apos;t sure, but you doubt very much it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;him.*&lt;/i&gt;
Don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest, red lizard creature. Everything&apos;ll go &lt;i&gt;&apos;oom! &lt;/i&gt;DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
*Shrug. Did she expect anything less?*
Fear of the unknown, fear of change: these are the things that poison civilisations.
Dead Adventurer&apos;s Log
*From within the totem, an otherworldly voice...*
The blade is thirsty. Now, what can I do to thank you for saving Sir Gareth? Fancy a weapons upgrade? We don&apos;t have much, but you&apos;re welcome to what&apos;s here.
Let&apos;s go. We&apos;ll be harder to track if we keep in motion.
*Step up to Roost and demand to know who issued the Godwoken contract.*
Trader Adam
Ooooooh that&apos;s a pretty &apos;un!
*The dwarf eyes you steadily and silently, his mouth a straight line and his eyes like marbles of steel.*
Ow! That hurt, yer &apos;ig &apos;leeding&apos; &apos;astard! &apos;ut if you&apos;ve gotten it outta you now, then fine. Just don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
Everything. Their feeble attack strategy, their plans for the Lady Vengeance. Gareth, the Seekers... they can&apos;t escape Alexandar&apos;s wrath. They are wholly unprepared.
Then again, one never knows...
*Ask who they were.*
You know, I think I&apos;ve heard of you. The assassin with the needle... I&apos;d much rather have one such as you for an ally, not an adversary. After all, you did come back for me and all those others on a sinking ship.
W-what...? No... no! It can&apos;t be! Who did this?!
*Raedalus gives you a nod of acknowledgement. You know they&apos;ll leave now for the Hall of Echoes.*
*SCREE!*
*He shakes his head, and motions to the devastation encircling you. Corpses. Blood.*
This mottled hand-grip is stained and scratched from years of violent service. There is nought but empty space where it once held a blade.
&lt;i&gt;Names...?&lt;/i&gt; There are no names here - this is a depiction of suffering, the &lt;i&gt;universal truth!&lt;/i&gt; You must see beyond the &lt;i&gt;individual!&lt;/i&gt;
[SEBILLE] *Share the fear that you&apos;ll never be free. That your eventual enslavement will be as permanent as the scar on your cheek.*
*Ask him where, exactly, he thinks you&apos;re going.*
The man swore he was no Sourcerer. Loyal to the Order, he had only killed the Magister in defence of his home.
House Interior - Basement F
Character is disarmed!
If this man was to be believed he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the House of Shadows, which implies said institution exists no longer.
Them that didn&apos;t die were carried off to the cave. Might be I was the lucky one, lying there, bleeding out.
Welcome to the &lt;font color=&quot;70b10e&quot;&gt;Character Creation&lt;/font&gt; Screen! Here, you can select an &lt;font color=&quot;70b10e&quot;&gt;Origin character&lt;/font&gt; or create a &lt;font color=&quot;70b10e&quot;&gt;custom hero&lt;/font&gt;.
There&apos;s nothing more I can tell you. You&apos;ve done your part; I&apos;ve done mine.
They did not deserve their sacrifice. And I do not deserve their gift.
A pity, but we mustn&apos;t be deterred!
*Almira doesn&apos;t respond right away. Instead she turns and gazes intently at the island. After a long moment, she finally speaks.*
Maybe the river could be crossed on that?
You can&apos;t make someone feel something they don&apos;t. And that night... well, it was clear to me how you felt.
...but you should broach more &lt;i&gt;practical &lt;/i&gt;matters with Lord Protector Arhu, the Keeper of the Cathedral. You should find him in his chambers there.
*Agree to end their suffering.*
*Tell her you need to get into Arx. Urgently.*
If I had your mind, I&apos;d rather wish I could change it too.  But very well, do take your time.
Spirit of an Elf
*The lizard slumbers deeply.*
