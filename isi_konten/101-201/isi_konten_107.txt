As the Gods fell and the island crumbled, Malady came to the rescue.
You there. Dwarf. You lookin&apos; for a match? Bet you make up for your height with a good, strong sword-arm, isn&apos;t that right?

I understand. But please... &lt;i&gt;hurry&lt;/i&gt;.

...but where&apos;s it going?

Handkerchief
*Say that you have the amulet already.*
Your chance to hit an enemy.
My child.  Where you go, the King follows. What you say, the King hears. You travel the edges of the Void, Godwoken. &lt;b&gt;Kill her,&lt;/b&gt; lest you slip beyond its horizon.
*The Magister lies on the floor, unconscious and bleeding from a dire-looking wound.*
Give the Swornbreaker to Almira... or keep it.
*Tell her it was you who ate the egg.*

That cow must&apos;ve hated you pretty badly.
*Nod. You remember him.*
I see you wear no mask. You are proud of your heritage, as I am.
Speaking of, let&apos;s move.
Ice Breaker Scroll
*Wonder what the Magisters are doing in the marshes.*
*Play nice.*
*Agree to be on your way.*
You seem different. Tell me, what have you learned? Or has the blackroot simply addled your skull beyond repair?
