My Story So Far...
Find the fugitive Lich once more.
Halla&apos;s Buried Valuables
*Shrug and drive the dagger into his chest.*
*She seems awfully serious. What happened?*
Kill? Have you lost your senses? I&apos;m- *cough* I&apos;m not here to kill. I&apos;m here t&apos;die.
Straight to the point - and dramatic to boot! I like it. But first, hear me out.
*Say it shouldn&apos;t speak to a Godwoken that way.*
Ok, wooden lady! Let&apos;s find out what makes you tick, and quick.
Both the Divine Order and the Black Ring seem determined to kill off the Godwoken.
*You don&apos;t have time for this. Turn and walk away.*
Oh, but the death you think you know is an illusion; those who meet their true end are puppets, and I their puppetmaster. Your bones will &lt;i&gt;dance&lt;/i&gt; for me!
It&apos;s Eternal, but I can&apos;t quite make it out...
&lt;i&gt;Nnnnnooooo.&lt;/i&gt;
Help! Someone, please!
An old teacher&apos;s note mentioned the name &apos;Iris&apos;. The little girl has an iris flower in her hair. The name suits her.
...I create my own happiness.
*Change your mind. Not really.*
Never thought I&apos;d say this, but I hope they round up them Sourcerers for good.
Fyr-a las!
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;VELVET FEATHER&lt;/b&gt;.*
Please - do you know what this is? Can you help?
I hate to crash the party. But I think the time&apos;s come for an... intervention. There&apos;s a matter I need to attend to, you see.
Cow.
&apos;Infinity is not the answer. Answer search continues...&apos;
I could not have done this without you. I am damn, damn, &lt;i&gt;damn &lt;/i&gt;lucky we met.
Artefacts of the Tyrant
[RED PRINCE] *Tell her you are a prince, the Spouse of the Sun, and she&apos;ll address you with the proper deference.*
I&apos;ve no time for chatter, stranger. There&apos;s a young woman in need of my help... just as soon as I&apos;ve gathered my thoughts.
Burn my beard! That means... if we&apos;ve been travelling for... YES! Only 10.34 nautical miles to Fort Joy...
Yes... the God King!
[FANE] *Say that it is a chance to know the truth.*
*Say you have no clue what&apos;s going on during battle.*
Burro
*Tell him the Divine is dead, no matter how much anyone prays.*
Elven Labrys
What a waste.
Earth Corruption
*Ask her if she can help you get rid of your Source collar.*
A standard staff uplifted by the delicate filigree engraving that dances around the tip.
I bet you still think it&apos;s about the rebellion. So quaint! No, Marcus. The Order comes for the Kingdom, and so it must be silenced. We soon release Deathfog... into all of Arx.
*Tell her you&apos;re a hero in this town. And you&apos;re going to milk that for all you can get. But you need to look the part - and that&apos;s expensive. You&apos;ll spend a little - to make a lot.*
*Consume what remains of the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*She&apos;s right - you don&apos;t like the way your God has been acting. Denounce Duna.*
I hope so too. Thanks, chief.
*Tell her that all her people are still well.*
You make a bit of trouble, I hear. Come on, then. Off to prison with you.
Criminal! I&apos;ve been looking for you! Are you ready to meet your fate?
Wouldn&apos;t know. Guy was no acquaintance of mine. Contract&apos;s a contract.
Atusa by name.
Any frrriend to Mumsy is a frrriend to me. I believe the song is arrround here somewherrre...
Mill
[1] Physical Damage
No longer the seat of the Divine, Arx was abandoned to the Deathfog and the dead. In time, the great city and its cathedral - Lucian&apos;s memorial - faded from memory, forgotten by the world.
*Keep your hands on your weapon.*
One of us offered to host the demon and free the child. The demon accepted.
Nice to meet another so-called Godwoken.
Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!
I guess it was always going to be you, wasn&apos;t it. I hope you&apos;re happy.
*Examine the skeleton.*
Did you really think you could get away with it? You are under arrest!
*Your body is still, but your soul floats upwards. You see yourself when you look down. Content. Safe.*
[BEAST] *Jerk your chin in the direction of the broken rapier. Friend of his?*
*Laugh and say that you were just joking.*
*Say you&apos;re in need of a Cleric - someone who can heal and support your team.*
Scarred by battles of yesteryear and the rusts of this summer&apos;s rain, this curved blade bears the unmistakeable craftsmanship of the Ancient Empire&apos;s House of War.
*Say the Divine Order has done terrible things to many people; he isn&apos;t alone.*
*Mock the defenceless Windego. It seems her sins have caught up with her.*
Much like yourself.
&lt;i&gt;Power.&lt;/i&gt;
Quite a beauty, ain&apos;t she guv&apos;nor? Lemme tell you how she rolls.
So what&apos;ll it be, elf? A sword? You&apos;ve already picked up a scar someplace - maybe you ought to invest in some better armour, heh...
With their power returned, the elves reclaimed their lands from the Deathfog and began to rebuild.
*The imposing statue looms over you. The flames enveloping it flow upwards, stoked by unseen magic, then dissipating in the thick air.*
Tsch! Don&apos;t worry Zharah, we&apos;d have to be &lt;i&gt;enthusiastically&lt;/i&gt; suicidal to try and take anything from the Silver Claw.
There we go. The door&apos;s opening.
My energy is sapped and my knowledge has been imparted. Continue on your way, Godwoken.
Can&apos;t believe we lost so many men and still never got through the last gate...
Better watch yerself, lad. Got greedy eyes on ya. Sets me on edge!
Focus! Stop her Sourcery!
You ben-Mezd?
A promising pile of cut, poisoned potatoes, only a bit of hot oil away from becoming the perfect weapon.
*Leave him be.*
*Say you&apos;ve changed your mind, and show him the object you found. Is that it?*
Lord Arhu is imprisoned in Kemm&apos;s vault.
*He bows his head in salute, and gets back to work.*
You&apos;re here now, you may as well stay. After all, outside the weather is... inclement, is it not?
*She chuckles once more.*
*Hands in the air, you take a step back.*
The dwarf queen Justinia, urged on by her advisor Isbeil, plotted to deathfog Arx. We stopped them just in time.
So fret not, but revel in the promise of the lake! Even without my guidance you have become a true Master of the Source. I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have something else to teach you...
You&apos;re not gettin&apos; an answer &apos;til you keep your hands free of wands &apos;n&apos; such.
*Suddenly, her breath sours in your mouth. It is rank, mouldering, thick with the taint of death. You try to pull away, but she is holding you tight and hard.*
*Ahem* Out with it.
Beard
How she spoils our sport!
All done?
*Reach out, stick your fingers in his mouth, make as if to grip the bolt... and pull.*
You&apos;re unbelieveable. Never mind. Let&apos;s keep moving. &lt;i&gt;Like you said.&lt;/i&gt;
Until we meet again.
Alertness Herbmix
Never thought I&apos;d be grateful to be holed up below decks. Especially on a ship like this&apos;un.
A ridiculous tale.
My big brother said a voidling will come and eat my shoes if I don&apos;t do his chores. I don&apos;t want a voidling to eat my shoes.
*Gesture to the Sourcerer. While Jonathan was babbling, his prisoner was trying to escape.*
Soothing Cold Scroll
*Tell him the job is done. Sadha is dead - and he may now flee to the Hall of Echoes.*
*She squeezes your hand gently, her claws gently resting on your bone, and tells you how much she&apos;s missed you.*
Ballistic Shot Skillbook
*At all costs? Say you aren&apos;t willing to harm anyone for such a goal.*
Halcyon
You dare speak of &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; when you refused us? You dare speak of &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; when you were happy to see us part forever?
Fine.
Good. You understand.
*Give Griff what he asks for.*
&lt;i&gt;She&apos;s insane.&lt;/i&gt;
He has told me his plan, elf. Lucian will not wash our sins away with water or fire, but with Deathfog. The true faithful will bathe in the fog of their own accord, and he will reward them with eternal bliss.
One volume of Cranley Huwbert&apos;s extensive encyclopedia series.
*Raise an eyebrow and ask if whatever he is doing is somehow related to the Red Princess.*
I remain Sworn to the God King. By reclaiming the powers of Divinity from Dallis, perhaps I could defeat him.
Reduces the damage from fire-based attacks.
At the Elf Temple we came upon a stand-off between Gareth and Alexandar. Gareth has murder on his mind.
*Agree to watch out for these Soul Jars.*
*He grunts approvingly. Side-by-side, you stare together at the wave-dashed horizon.*
To be Divine
*A shadow crosses his face.*
What a horrific vision. I need my pen. I must write everything down...
melee
*She does not get the choice - touch upon her memories.*
*Ask her who (or what) she was &apos;hosting&apos; a few moments ago.*
Well... we&apos;re short on rangers... who did you have in mind?
*Say this is the culminating moment of your life. You love her.*
*Squeak!*
Survival is not something that interests me any longer. Not in this form.
[IFAN] *Say of course you aren&apos;t. You&apos;re talking to &lt;i&gt;him.*&lt;/i&gt;
Undead Scarecrow
You thought that was a &lt;i&gt;rift portal?!&lt;/i&gt; Lord, no. It&apos;s nothing of the sort.
*Energy spent, the spirit can only stare.*
*Tell him Delorus is safe and sound. He spoke often of his brother.*
*Tell her you&apos;re working towards... higher office. The salary is... substantial.*
Seems like a good deal to me. I&apos;ll go my way, and you can go yours.
A glowing portal took us to a lush desert oasis.
If you don&apos;t stow your weapons, I&apos;ll have no choice but to take them from you by force. I won&apos;t ask again.
It is a dark thing, to contemplate a demon&apos;s name. Perhaps you can shed light on the matter.
Lantern
After a long and harrowing journey,
Not an attempt, mate! Not if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; can bloody help it.
Win blindfold in the arena.
Hmm... you&apos;re a dying breed around here, my friend. Nobody has time for art these days...
*Snort. Does she truly believe people will submit so willingly?*
You know, mate. I&apos;ve met plenty of folks with a death wish before. Here more than anywhere else. Reckon I&apos;ll hand you credit for being creative. Let&apos;s make this quick.

Loot Character
Elven Twohander
I dare say in another lifetime, things could have worked out differently.
*The Magister looks at you curiously, as if with fevered eyes. He seems to see &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; at the edge of his vision, but then he shakes his head and laughs bitterly.*
Oh my! The purveyor of truth is slinging morals left and right like she&apos;s already been named Divine, while practically handing the Hammer a sure victory over Rivellon.
Fire Summon
I love that song, you know. But... I&apos;m not even sure who wrote it. Maybe it was me... maybe it was one of the voices. Maybe a bit of both.
The hefty metal head of this axe would look right at home in a forge. Or a skull.
Failure is not an option. Raise the stakes by limiting the already highly challenging Tactician Mode to a single save game. If your entire party perishes, the save game is erased and your quest is well and truly over!
Har. Har. Har. Very funny. Tell you what, I&apos;ve changed &apos;y &apos;ind... &apos;y &apos;ind... I&apos;ve had a change of heart. O&apos;en the chest. You deserve it.
With Justinia dead, the dwarven kingdom descended into chaos.
*Later. The dead stone of the city weighs on you - you feel the life teeming within it, frantic and desparately lonely. But not for long. You lift the helm. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is your purpose.*
Cuddles
Skeleton Painting
*Say that you are just looking for, er, honest work.*
