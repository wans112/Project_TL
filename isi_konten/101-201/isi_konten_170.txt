*He points to the location on your map.*
You one of her little Seekers? Chasing down Godwoken and beggin&apos; &apos;em to save us all? I admit I didn&apos;t see that one comin&apos;, Beast.
This is bad... you know who&apos;ll get the worst of it, eh, dwarf? The common man. Same story, every bloody time...
I know what your God has asked you to do. The choices he&apos;s forced you to make. Was it right? Can you truly say it was worth it?
I have nothing to give you - my thanks will have to suffice.
You there! Whatever you are... did Braccus send you? Is he ready to apologise?&lt;br&gt;
*Ignore her vain threat and demand to know who she was talking to.*
Raw Red Meat
Yeah, awright. Hur-hur.
*She stares at you, her face frozen, then blinks once, slowly, and snaps back to life.*
I&apos;m telling you, &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; more kid shouting by the pool and I&apos;m swimming to Driftwood!
I am more than capable of getting to my feet unaided, thank you. Assuming my feet are where I left them, of course...
...yes yes, it has shown it can adapt to unexpected circumstances. I suppose we can give it this chance at least.
Report back to the hens.
May you feel the pain of death tenfold!
[IFAN] *Tell him the Lone Wolves say &lt;i&gt;lizards&lt;/i&gt;: it&apos;ssssssssssss all in the tongue.*
*Touch the statue with your swathed hand.*
Radeka
Ah, freedom! I thought I was dead for sure, but the kindness of others saved me.
Human Children
Warm the bird up.
*Inside you, Duna rumbles in protest.*
Ser Koor
Nice day for it, all things considered.
We directed the Deathfog away from the city and out over nearby waters.
Pile of Dismembered Corpses
*As you step forwards to stand by his side, threatening the helpless Sourcerer, Ifan gives you an appraising glance. He nods, once, then returns to his interrogation.*
*Shrug. That&apos;ll do. He&apos;s free to go.*
&lt;i&gt;...you have wasted your time and mine.&lt;/i&gt;
Looks like it might&apos;ve been right about the gods. Suddenly I&apos;m pretty happy there isn&apos;t one camping out in my soul.
Oh no! The painting&apos;s been stolen. Aw. Poor you. Bye-ee.
Yeah! YEAH! You&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;make &lt;/i&gt;one! And I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll...
You name it, I&apos;ve chatted with it behind my own two eyes.
*Ask Han what he means by &apos;safety&apos;. Where are you to go?*
Alone...
*Apologise for your forgetfulness and ask her to remind you about this book she seeks.*
*Gulp.* I think so.
Servant of Death
Toy Crossbow
All that you give up, you give back to the realm. It&apos;s very simple. And very selfish to refuse.
*Scratch your head. How are these useless things going to get results?*
Let it end. Let it end. Let it end.
I suppose, circumstances being what they are, it could be advantageous.
Sewers Key
That I have, ma&apos;am! Thank you, ma&apos;am! Bred and trained for service I am, ma&apos;am! And proud to be some help! Ma&apos;am!
*Ask if he&apos;s sure. You don&apos;t know the first thing about wine. It&apos;d be wasted on you.*
I woke up in a courtesan&apos;s bed with a vision of the secret of my soul. She called me to her.
Battle is dangerous, is it not? I find it to be true, anyway, even when you&apos;re battling your own mortality. The angst can prove... terminal to the weak-willed.
Razor
*Bend down and stroke his head.*
*Kemm&apos;s eyes turn very, very dark.*
Hey, hold on a darn minute there!
You&apos;re dead, Alexandar! Stay dead!
the Beast o&apos; the Sea,
I know the signs. They cannot be denied. Now come. The future awaits.
Sallie
You farin&apos; okay so far?
*Step between the prisoner and Kemm. He can&apos;t do this.*
Heh. You don&apos;t waste time on the niceties, do you? Well, I wouldn&apos;t show this to just anyone...&lt;br&gt;
Brutal Mace
&lt;i&gt;I choose... me. And I choose you. I choose us.&lt;/i&gt;
No need to get rude. I come bearing a gift.
The Red Princess awaits the Red Prince in the Ancient Empire consulate. She is in grave danger.
Be careful, now. Those beasts are nothing to sneeze at!
I don&apos;t know how it all went so wrong so fast. We came to get the Purging Wands from Braccus&apos; old armoury. Loaded up the last of &apos;em without any trouble.
[BARBARIAN] *Roar your displeasure. You will not be denied Divinity!*
Wand of the Elder
By all means, get an eyeful.
Thank you for your service.
Unless you have proof that this... this &lt;i&gt;cook &lt;/i&gt;is responsible, you had best keep out of my way!
Took a beating from Murga, did you? No shame in it... I just wish someone&apos;d give her a thrashing some day...
*The child looks at you straight on, unafraid, searching the shadows cloaking your face. He lifts his mirror to his nose, closes one eye, and looks at himself again.*
A thousand bottles o&apos; dust!
It&apos;s a long story. But I think I&apos;ll leave it in the past, and look to the future instead!
We healed Jules. He gave us a skillbook.
Cursed Oil
*Deny him.*
And yet I suspect there&apos;s even more to know about you. Isn&apos;t that right, &lt;i&gt;Godwoken?&lt;/i&gt;
*She doesn&apos;t need to worry about note-taking anymore. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
[LOHSE] *Say you&apos;re sorry to disappoint her, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case. You only met the thing in your head again. He was gloating over the condition of the gods.*
Broken Grating
Exploration Theme 01 Light B
They&apos;ve always been snakes in the grass. Cheap labour, sure. And hard workers too. Half of them are their queen&apos;s spies: her eyes, her ears, her poison-pouring hands.
*The spirit of a Magister jabs a spectral finger into the Paladin&apos;s wound, while muttering some profane-sounding curse...*
Status Effects
Heals allies or smashes skulls, depending on the direction of the winds
*Nod. That&apos;s sensible enough.*
*Admit that it does sound a little... nutty.*
Maybe another one will show up if I wait long enough...
Ah, go talk to The Raucous One. Tell him I sent you, and he&apos;ll set you up for a challenge. Prove yourself worthy fighting my acolytes &lt;i&gt;blindfolded.&lt;/i&gt;
Fane pledged his support in my fight for Divinity.
*Hunger rises deep within you. You - or the thing inside you - wants her Source, so badly you can taste it.*
Goat&apos;s cheese? Mother, are you &lt;i&gt;mad?!&lt;/i&gt;
Ah, of course it wasn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;luck&lt;/i&gt;, was it... Godwoken?
*She looks into your eyes, her face set in a fierce frown.*
I think you might find this... interesting, Beast.
These things are &lt;i&gt;rank.&lt;/i&gt;
[1] was invulnerable to [2]&apos;s attack.
No.
*She throws her arms around you in a tight embrace.*
*He takes you into his arms, into his heart, into his very being...*
Your Godwoken soul is my last refuge, my last bastion... and now you have brought me a gift...
The words of Consul Zara are not inane babbling. Speak them or be silent.
All yours. Just watch it round elves - turns &apos;em rabid.
*Squints...* Reckon I mistook you for someone else. You&apos;re a might uglier than that fella anyhow.
*Quietly take your leave without disturbing them.*
*Looking  at the barrel, you see that someone has scrawled &apos;Black House&apos; on it in paint. As you cast your eyes around, you see that every barrel headed to Arx has the same inscription.*
A Jar of Mind Maggots
A yarrow. How beautiful. And large, too...
Raanaar Amulet
*Remind her of the phrase &apos;pride comes before the fall&apos;.*
A truth! So rare to hear in this world.
Their hearts have stopped beating. We may leave.
Return to the Arena Master.
*The spirit looses the arrow. It evaporates into nothing against your hand. No pain... though a shiver runs up your arm...*
Thou art fortunate: when I still wore scales I would have cut you down without a thought.
*Unseen hands force her to her knees. Her lips move more rapidly... there&apos;s a faint sound next to you, like an echo... the metallic rasp of a sword being unsheathed.*
*The warg yelps in agony and bites your arm...*
If you see anything, tell me or my men at once. Otherwise keep the hell out of our way!
Urrggh...
The war-drums keep the rhythm of patrol...
Loading
What&apos;s it look like.
Your Highness! Yes! I&apos;m working feverishly to concoct a proper meal for you.
*She drops to the floor, soundlessly.*
Ctrl
My fate is not for me to decide - remember, &lt;i&gt;master?&lt;/i&gt; Have your way with me, but spare me your sympathies.
Ouch! Be careful... please, I&apos;m so scared... can&apos;t you open the grate?
*You can feel a cold rage building inside you. You want vengeance!*
*As she considers your statement, her nostrils start to twitch. She lifts her head and takes a long drag of the air around her.*
And I&apos;m thankful, naturally. I don&apos;t know what I would do in this world without my people.
*The figures retreats, angry and sore - but most of all weak. You sense that this is not something to which the figure is accustomed. You can feel its fear. And then an ominous rumble begins...*
*You turn to walk away, but as you do you feel a cold, heavy thump on your shoulder. You look up into the fierce red eyes of the raven.*
Time... time has a way of changing someone. Lucian did not start as the man he became. You are now a guiding star. I can only ask you don&apos;t lead your people astray.
Silenced
Well, &lt;i&gt;good. &lt;/i&gt;Come on over here then and show me what I&apos;ve been missing.
Select
A promise that you will never hear in this life!
Please, leave me be! I don&apos;t want to draw attention, even here.
Looking to trade? I&apos;ll give you &lt;i&gt;plenty&lt;/i&gt; for a very particular book I&apos;m looking for: a tome to teach me how to make corpses... &lt;i&gt;explode&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask what he&apos;ll do with himself now.*
Fane travelled Rivellon,
House Exterior - Forest Worker House A
*Her nails dig deeper. They draw blood.*
*Ask the dog if its job isn&apos;t to hunt Sourcerers. Tell it to go find the one who did this.*
No. Never.
*Take your leave.*
But my darling kin, why ever not?
&apos;ullo, sir!
NnnnnNNNNNNNNGH! I can&apos;t bear this... this existential agony. &lt;i&gt;What have you...&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that what is art to him, is the most ignominious of horrors to you.*
Is that what you think, prince? *Sigh*
Ow! I think I&apos;m missing something here...
*Growl!* You! Stick! Behave! Or else!
I had hoped Rivellon would never see them again, but these are dark days.
Tavern Trader
*Ask if he&apos;s afraid of what comes next.*
Grants the user an additional level.
Skewer
*Offer some Drudanae.*
The heart of the vile elven network is the Mother Tree. She is rooted on this island, and I believe she is aiming to extend her roots into the powers of divinity that lie here. The powers you seek.
When one strips away from the term all the pomp, all the piety, all the manifold associations it calls to mind, one is left with a single word:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Act with honour, or be consumed.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask to trade.*
S&apos;what it looks like. We were on our way to Arx to set up shop for Lucian&apos;s Day, but there&apos;s no hope of that now. Whatever&apos;s going on in Paradise Downs has good and blocked the path.
We were going to flee Arx, but not anymore. Even if the boat had survived the flood, I doubt it&apos;d survive the Voidwoken.
*The sword slides smoothly free - but the silence of the cave is broken by the clank and whirr of machinery.*
*Shake your head. You&apos;re just having a look around.*
Let&apos;s, eh... let&apos;s keep moving.
It&apos;s out in the swamps. Ain&apos;t a home, but you can breathe for a minute and figure out what to do next. Here, I&apos;ll mark it on your map. Maybe I&apos;ll see you there.
*Tell him to stop interrupting.*
