The Indomitable talent won&apos;t have any effect while this status is present.
On with ya, then.
*Say nothing.*
&apos;Course once the Voidwoken landed, that were the only thing on anyone&apos;s lips.
Attack Item
*Take your needle and jab it about an inch into his lower jaw.*
*Scoff at his arrogance. He&apos;s just a dog.*
Return to Eithne.
That sounded dangerously close to an independent thought. How surprisingly self-aware of you!
Things are under control. For now.
Spirit of a Woman in Love
So... I guess this is it.
Messenger Owl
Sacrifice yourself to bring an ally back to life. Deals [1] to you, and resurrects target character with maximum Vitality.
Hatchet
*Hold out your arm. It is free to take some of your blood.*
*ALARM! ALARM!*

This handwritten diary is bound with barrel clasps holding it together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contents rhapsodise about the divine nature of barrels. Lovingly-drawn sketches show various things that can be placed inside barrels. One thing&apos;s for sure: the author was clearly very passionate about their weird interest. In barrels, in case that wasn&apos;t clear.
Chapter 2 - Escape from Reaper&apos;s Eye
Audrey! What happened? W-what is this place?
Dead Black Ring Painweaver
*The troll&apos;s spirit roars in anger and swings a fist at you - to no effect. He&apos;s gone before he can swing the other fist.*
Strength
Gods know how much blood you have on your hands now. You &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;let &apos;em go. This is our only hope against the Voidwoken.
Haven&apos;t got a collar for you. &lt;i&gt;Dammit&lt;/i&gt;.
Chop, chop!
Pants of Battle
*It looks haggard and weak, its very voice but a feeble echo of your own.*
If I weren&apos;t on orders from Griff, I&apos;d smash in that mossy little face of yours.
Livewood? You have taken a dead elf and carved it into a pleasure yacht?
*Ask who he is.*
Already Equipped
Move along.
Keep your weapons sheathed. There&apos;s a reward in this for us, surely.&lt;br&gt;
Sentry&apos;s Helmet
*Say you know the voice belonged to the Devourer.*
It&apos;s... MAGNIFICENT.
Pfft, we have all swatted flies. That is not what lies ahead of you.
*So what happened next? Say he can&apos;t stop his story there!*
*Order him to tell you where this island is.*
Dwarf
His was a lesson - meant to discipline, not to edify.
Magister Ranley, Caulker&apos;s Mate of the Divine Eminence vessel, &lt;i&gt;Lady Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt;
Not so fast! I will give you anything you desire, anything at all. &lt;i&gt;ANYTHING.&lt;/i&gt;
*Consider a moment, then nod. Sure you do.*
Missive to Remove the Secret Entrance
[ELF] *Ask if Griff won&apos;t be angry to see her selling to an elf.*
It is only natural, after so long spent alone. But you must be wary. Some of these creatures are more dangerous than they seem.
Dallis is the queen bee now, and all those little Magisters drone to her heart&apos;s content.
Find Alexandar.
*Breathless, the Magister fishes out a canteen of water. He gulps half of it down, then splashes blood and grime from his face with the rest. He nods to you, a touch wary.*
More of them! These beasts are damn persistent!
UI
*Tell the elf to get lost, you&apos;ll go see the Doctor if and when you&apos;re good and ready.*
You must know she is my deepest desire, that I have longed for since my soul slipped into consciousness.
We got arrested and thrown into a cell within the fort. Perhaps we can turn this to our advantage.
No... You&apos;re alive and you&apos;re having a conversation. You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; on a ship of course, but luckily for us both we&apos;re merely sailing the plain old sea.
Remember that client? Lord whatever it was?
So dark. So cold...
Fire Slug
Bandit Dwarf Huntress
Quit yer spittin&apos;! There&apos;s work to be done at the dig. Where&apos;s yer shovel?
What are you waiting for? Go on then, give me the short, sharp shock I need! &lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt;
Cat Jump
Thou art fortunate: when I still wore scales I&apos;d cut you down without a thought.
*Insist on speaking with Arhu. It&apos;s an urgent matter.*
Come, mortal. My claws ache for your flesh.
You stay away from that man, do you hear me? Erma isn&apos;t... what Jeth says is a &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt;. You hear me?
Dallis the Eternal told Lucian about Divinity and the God King. Together they plotted to prevent the God King ever returning to the world.
What can you do to me now? Look: I had orders from Queen Justinia. And, to be honest, I&apos;d reached the end of my tether with what I could do here. It was my time...
Even with the world as it is, people will buy anything.
You freed a master of the magical arts. For that, I&apos;ll leave your bones intact. For demolishing Mordus&apos; minions, I&apos;ll give you a skillbook of your choice. Choose your subject.
Indeed not - but they have been corrupted by their own vanity. By the pettiness of the mortals they crafted.
Save yourself - embrace Divinity. Your kind is... troubled... but not beyond salvation.
*One...*
*She trails off and her eyes flit upwards, as if listening to a voice only she can hear.*
&lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; if one seeks to elude the shadow.
...don&apos;t hurt me, don&apos;t hurt me, don&apos;t hurt me, don&apos;t hurt me, don&apos;t hurt me, don&apos;t hurt me...
*Tell him that you&apos;ve come seeking help. You want the thing, the &lt;i&gt;demon&lt;/i&gt;, cast out for good.*
If I didn&apos;t know better, I&apos;d swear you could see me clear as I see you.
*Say that this is just what your face looks like.*
Redbrand Outfit
*He looks relieved. Then he looks worried.*
*The tip of his tail starts to wag.*
What are the Magisters really up to?
*Offer to give her the missing amount.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Ask it what crime led to its imprisonment here.*
A great battle is being waged. It is the twilight of the Seven and the day-to-dawn of the One.
*You are Mrazxken the engineer. After long years of quiet work, the gem falls into the jaws of two great Black Ring wargs, who treat it as a toy. The machine suspects you of sabotage and responds in self-defence.*
If I can&apos;t fix the road I&apos;ll be in the shite. Literally.
*Now that she&apos;s safe, ask where she&apos;ll go.*
Yes. Yes, you look just the type. Egg thief. I knew it.
Let this be a lesson to you. Those you trust the most can surprise you terribly.
I thought you were here to help... I was wrong. Leave this place.
Paulina Kemm&apos;s Chamber Key
*In lieu of laying a comforting hand on her shoulder, lay it on the armrest beside her, and say you&apos;re sorry for what happened to her.*
You what? No, mate. I&apos;ve got orders.
Won&apos;t budge!
We brought Saheila safely out of the sawmill.
Blades won&apos;t mark, magic won&apos;t maim, and I won&apos;t budge.
*Tell her you&apos;ll keep an eye out and be on your way.*
*The tree-form spirit roars in anger, pain, and fear, as if for all the elves.*
*Remind him that earlier he mentioned a second part - something to help you be rid of the demon. What did he mean?*
Well, at least they added a shrub to the ghastly place…
An odorous mixture of mutton, Source, and a pinch of fresh earth, as is customary. Used as an offering to Duna’s Undertaker.
*Actually, you think you might be better off alone for now.*
There are always more. Don&apos;t you know that?
We ate the untainted egg.
Can we... help you?
Go on. Haven&apos;t you been dying to sink your teeth into me?
You must leave me, ever so briefly. You must defeat the God King and become the new Divine.
So, report. Did you find anything?
*Reassure him he needn&apos;t worry: he has an ally in you.*
You... you will die... all of you...
Backpack
[ELF] *Ask him why not; what has he heard about your kind?*
Turn Action Points: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
*Resist.*
Lucian&apos;s legs, no-one&apos;s ever felt me liftin&apos; off &apos;em. You&apos;re good.
*Approach and touch Lohse&apos;s arm. Tell her it&apos;s time to get out of here.*
Hacker
*The altar lies in silence, glowing faintly with a familiar, comforting warmth.*
Well...&lt;i&gt; maybe.&lt;/i&gt;
*Inquire as to whether he has a home to go to.*
There is little to celebrate in the world today and much to regret - and the death of Karon the Godwoken is neither. One suspects it&apos;s a relief for all concerned. It certainly is for me.
Lucian&apos;s liver, how did you cut up your leg so badly?
We gave Lagan his wedding ring.
It got damaged in the fighting. It&apos;ll fix up just fine.
How&apos;s about a trade? Our deaths for your... well, let&apos;s call it &apos;life&apos;? You walk out of here, and leave us your word that you&apos;ll destroy our Soul Jars?
Sadha entrusted us with one of her eggs. If I cast fire on it, a dragon will be born!
Marksman
*Laugh and ask if he&apos;d like to catch up on his reading first. He&apos;s a few centuries behind.*
*The spirit continues to stare at you unwaveringly.*
*You chew it for what seems like forever, yet the texture does not change in your mouth. Tough, yet moist; leathery, yet slippery. As an elf, you are used to eating flesh. But this? This is &lt;i&gt;disgusting.*&lt;/i&gt;
Your request is noted and ignored. The Seven lords sealed me in this tomb, and I will need my strength if I am to retrieve the Aeteran and have my revenge.
*He nods his thanks to you before turning and following a path into the unknown.*
*Smile and say it&apos;s no problem. Ask what&apos;s going on here.*
No! I&apos;m sorry! Don&apos;t leave me!
For one thousand years I&apos;ve listened to talk. Nay, it is time for action!
Ugh. So many questions. I would say curiosity killed the cat, but you already know that, don&apos;t you?
You&apos;ve been proven a friend to Duna&apos;s spawn. So from one friend to another, I say: get out of Arx. Leave it far behind and never look back. I can&apos;t say why... but trust me. Just do it.
&lt;i&gt;Let me show you the error of your ways.&lt;/i&gt;
Unusually Large Orange
[SOLDIER] *Your eyes harden. The wounds in his back - he was cut down while he ran away.*
Hm? What? How did I get... Hey, stop following me!
Hehe... Hehehe... Hehehehehe... come, hear my joke... What is it that I guard?
The Dreamers took her away, but I don&apos;t know how their magic works. You&apos;ll find the answer in the consulate, my prince - amid the fire and the chaos...
Dorotya&apos;s Kissing Spot
*Nod along. But why do they hate &apos;giant&apos; races so much?*
Mine
Good day to you, you large and terrifying lizard!
I&apos;m glad you told us. &lt;i&gt;Thank &lt;/i&gt;you.
I am different. I think and feel. It is the work of Vredeman - Dallis wanted more than a ship; she wanted a warrior slave who was bound to obey.
*Pause. &apos;Always does&apos;? Ask if this sort of thing happens often.*
*The spirit before you is paper-thin, as though there was hardly enough Source in it to manifest at all.*
*&apos;Help...&apos; You splutter weakly, your mouth producing more water than words.  Rough hands grab you, rolling you over to stare into the face of a sneering dwarf.*
*Explain that you&apos;ve found a Purging Wand in the vault, but it&apos;s inert.*
Can&apos;t chat, I&apos;m afraid. Kemm&apos;s got us working round the clock...
*Shrug and accept his overture at face value.*
Or what? Your threats carry no weight...
Press [IE_ActionMenu] to open your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Hotbar&lt;/font&gt;, move the cursor to an empty slot and press [IE_ControllerContextMenu].
By Duna&apos;s dagger! You here to free us, or kill us?
*You take it he&apos;s no Lone Wolf. Ask what he was doing here.*
*Frown. Do the mainlanders really think of you as a monster?*
*The hanging Sourcerer winks at you, and cuts another segment of rope. He&apos;ll soon be free.*
*Note that the honey smells... &lt;i&gt;odd.*&lt;/i&gt;
