Clear a safe path back to Almira.
Can&apos;t just leave the prisoner alone, though. I heard he might be the one causing trouble upstairs.
*Say that it doesn&apos;t matter - they were people - murdered and cannibalised.*
However, it is the path we walk. No - *cough* - no matter what the cost. No matter *rasp* what is asked of you -
*Say you feel your characters have been making some progress.*
*Tell him you&apos;re a wink away from gutting him like a fish.*
Patty Cake, Patty Cake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most fun about adventuring, is when we all just gather round a campfire and get cosy. Especially if someone in the party is a good cook and puts their cooking pot over the campfire. That&apos;s the prelude of an awesome rest.
A space inside you clears. You have room for more Source. You have room for more... &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. You have room for the whispers of the trees.
The dwarves salvaged Deathfog from a Magister ship. We should get to the bottom of this.
Until next time.
Well that&apos;s one problem solved. Now on to the next...!
*Tell the rat you get it - it cannot tell the truth.*
Hah! Say that to Griff&apos;s face and see if that knife &apos;a his don&apos;t give you somethin&apos; to answer to. Criminy, Kristof, when&apos;d you get so big in your boots?
Zorl-Stissa... she taught us about the survival of the fittest.&lt;br&gt;And so it came to pass.
Wised up yet, mate?
*Scowl. Sea dogs have barked out better tunes than that.*
Guardian&apos;s Polearm
GIVE ME YOUR BLOOD! PLEASE!
Riveted Leggings
With their new dwarven Divine, the dwarves led the Alliance in the war on the God King. Dwarves led the world... until the truth of the Divine&apos;s deal with the demon emerged. The kingdom split from the Alliance, and fell into chaos.
We found a fighting arena beneath the Black Bull tavern in Driftwood.
Furious Tide
Source-user! Your kind must be stopped!
Perhaps Saheila the elf will know of a way out.
Toggle Visibility
Your kind always hung closest to our Divine, like wolves around a campfire.
Dungeon - Empty Room (Left Angle)
The stolen fountainhead of Divinity is hidden deep in the Academy. Mortals kill for it, but my people are the rightful owners.
*The warg snarls and growls at you.*
*Um... You were just looking for a little physical comfort...*
The Seven are gone. Slain by their Godwoken. Slain by &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. You have the potential - the obligation, even - to do better than they did. To create a better world than the world they made.
A friend... hopefully with good news.
I know, I know. We&apos;ve got work to do. So, er, what did you want to talk about?
My knowledge is but a pond; Gratiana&apos;s is the sea. It is the sea you should speak to.
Look for information on Sebille&apos;s &apos;Master&apos;.
Save me, Lucian...
Earth-dreamer
*Pause and ask what shinies he&apos;s talking about.*
Fill up on tales lived by cultures past...
*Shrug and say he can call himself whatever he likes, before asking what has him on edge.*
We showed them! Yes we did! We showed them &lt;i&gt;how to die!&lt;/i&gt;
By all means!
*You contemplate his words and come to a conclusion: he&apos;s still a dead man.*
And so I met Stingtail, who told me to find Bahara. I did not find her, however, leaving me in need of another Master Dreamer.
*Ralvo looks you up and down.*
We have a Swornbreaker! We can undo her Covenant!
*She raises herself to her feet unsteadily.*
*She seizes your hands and holds them tightly in hers.*
*Breathe deeply. This is the moment. The moment everything changes. Tell him you&apos;re ready.*
[SOLDIER] *Put on your most convincing formal affect. You come on orders of the Paladin leader.*
Best of luck, Godwoken.
I told you once already - bow your head! The Endless Prayer will call our Godwoken to greatness - ascension, Divinity itself!
But when I sniffed him? How he is for true? I ran and ran and ran.
Cursed
Magister Seal
Rivellon&apos;s a big place, darling. And &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of it in a shambles. Where exactly do you want to know about?
He retired in disgrace, his pension intact.
*Tovah gives you a look that suggests she might know that you are judging her. Then she turns back to the corpse.*
Does anything seem different now?
I hope not. You&apos;ll be a god, not an amnesiac - right, chief?
Immune To Poisoning
...you - you killed her? How could you? This school is my life, and Griff&apos;s legacy. And you... you &lt;i&gt;desecrated&lt;/i&gt; it.
[1] has [2] seconds to do his/her actions!
Head upstairs, Godwoken. We&apos;ll speak more there.
Whatever&apos;s out there, it knows we&apos;re coming. We&apos;d better find it before it finds us.
The hunt is on, yes?
F11
You know &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; of my parents!
And you have found her!
*Try the green lever.*
You seem different. Tell me, what have you learned? Or has the blackroot simply addled your brain beyond repair?
Trolls... do you know a fascinating thing about trolls? I know ALL of them! I can tell you ANYTHING you need to know about trolls. My life&apos;s work was documenting them! &lt;i&gt;My life&apos;s work!&lt;/i&gt;
*Greed.*
*Note that she&apos;s still bound by the Covenant. What comes next for her?*
Already in use
*No - you&apos;re not to blame. You didn&apos;t mean for any of this to happen!*
Steal the beggar&apos;s pouch.
*The elf beams a wider grin than you&apos;ve seen so far in Fort Joy.*
*Turn and walk away without a word.*
The Doctor banished us from his house.
My friend is right, for the first time this century.
*Invite him to join you. You&apos;re heading for the mainland yourself.*
A sad thing even so - the spores are  &lt;i&gt;creation&lt;/i&gt; magic. So old even we Scions forget.
Kidnapping Contract
Hm. That&apos;s something I don&apos;t often hear. Thank you. Really.
*Assent and hand over Ifan&apos;s contract.*
We dug Vilnx Creeva up.
Bloody elves! All the same! Not worth the spit in a spittoon!
Lying scum! I&apos;ll see you rot in this mire.
&lt;i&gt;&apos; - in a savage la - &apos; &lt;/i&gt;*COUGH! HACK!*
Secret Vine
Applies Stunned.
*Tell him you&apos;re no Lone Wolf.*
*Ask where you can find Dallis.*
The most sacred city in Rivellon, on the brink of collapsing into the Void...
*A kiss. A sweet, stolen moment.*
*Say you&apos;ve often asked yourself the same questions.*
*Tell the spirit that you&apos;ll kill the doctor.*
*Tell her that&apos;s the stupidest plan you&apos;ve ever heard. No-one gets released from Fort Joy like that.*
The statues guard the vaults, where we kept those who were beyond help. No ritual could cleanse them of the dark forces that infested them, so we sealed them away.
I could lick your arm and tell you how you spent the night before last. Shall I?
Hatchling Spawn
We are battling for our very survival, and I doubt you would have us lose, Fane. Should we perish, we will be cast into oblivion. And I dare not dream what he will do to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
*Agree - opposites attract, and bygones can be bygones.*
A dusty old chamber with a demon locked inside... there&apos;s a metaphor in here somewhere. Why these folks&apos;d volunteer for it is beyond me.
[LIZARD] *Grimace. Does he think a lizard easily escapes notice in a place like Arx?*
Animators Reference: XB WeaponSet
Be still! I&apos;m trying to listen...
Brayton Barnes became a mayor.
Remember, one of your race&apos;s weaknesses is having your lungs filled with water until you can no longer breathe. So... try to avoid that, perhaps?
The thieving thugs are dead.
[UNDEAD] *Warn him away from eating the Voidwoken fish. The Void isn&apos;t as pleasant as he thinks.*
Not that you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to.
*The machine creaks to life and the Deathfog begins to flow.*
As you wish. You will return.
*He promises power, for a price. He picks off your golden scales, one by one, stripping you down to the bone. He promised you a crown, but all you got were shackles.*
*Tell him about your encounter with Hannag. She wanted you to protect him.*
*Ask what exactly he is. You&apos;ve never seen a skeleton like him before.*
*She looks out into the swirling blue and green of the Hall and sighs.*
*Nod. You are Tir-Cendelius&apos; chosen.*
Damn cursed armour. Who strings a pile o&apos;bones together and lets it eat people?
*Shield her eyes with your hand. No good can come of this.*
You&apos;ve so much potential. Come. I can teach you.
That bard&apos;s really something else. I could swear the mood&apos;s lightened around here already.
Carrot
*Mention that you had dealings with some of his compatriots before - Grog and Marg, they were called. Can&apos;t he just trust you and let you pass?*
Here lies Withermoore the cold-hearted
Roost&apos;s upstairs in the big house there, sir. He&apos;s waiting for you - reckon he&apos;s as eager to hear how you&apos;ve been &lt;i&gt;getting on &lt;/i&gt;as the rest of us.
Anisotropic 8x
*She sniffs. Loudly.*
Only a fool does not seize it.
Tick tock, Godwoken.
*Say that you&apos;ll be careful.*
Roost Anlon, who delivered Sebille to the Master, is dead. The Master is next.
Errrrr... statues coming to life?!
Master awaits you. West of here. Go, now.
*The beast tilts its head inquisitively. You feel a psychic push urging you to speak quickly.*
*You&apos;ll not let the one that scarred you go easy into the night. Gut him.*
Find Gratiana&apos;s Soul Jar.
Leave that alone!
Me too. This is fascinating.
...and you.
I bid you a good day and all the best in your future endeavours. &lt;i&gt;Obviously.&lt;/i&gt;
How young you were! Tell me, how was it?
[LOHSE] *Mumble that having an invisible voice in your ear isn&apos;t all it&apos;s cracked up to be.*
[1] increases your ability to resist stun attacks by [2]%.
*The nurse stares at you with unfathomable hunger. His sharpened fingernails gouge deeply into the wood of the desk, as if he can barely contain himself.*
Oh goodie! You&apos;re a good... uh... whatever it is you are. Yes you are! Who&apos;s a good thingy, then? You! That&apos;s who! I want to chase you under a rock! Yes! Wanna play rock-chasey?
I was never meant for battle!
Thank the Gods! By Divine grace, who was that howling...
You are the hope for our new homeland. The promise of our future. The very reason we do not give in to despair.
Let&apos;s make a deal. You keep your hands out of my pocket, and I keep my hands off of your throat.
Get yourself together - we still have cells for you to be thrown into! Now - &lt;i&gt;answer me! &lt;/i&gt;Why are you here?
Inflicts bleeding and deals [1].
[SEBILLE] *Wish for the Master here and now, so that you may maim and murder at leisure.*
Too skfffffinny, Eefer sfffffaid. Gotta get my pffffffflump on for fffwinter!
We need to shut this thing up!
Now I&apos;m even more annoyed. You&apos;re under arrest, thief.
*The elf smiles and bows to you in thanks.*
You... you&apos;d heal a complete stranger...? When Gareth leads us into battle, I&apos;ll be sure to remember my debt to you...
Hm. Won&apos;t budge. Must be something on the bridge.
*She holds up her needle, and eyes it with the same searching, questioning look she gave you.*
Go on. Feast on me. I know you want to.
*Ask her who she means by &apos;they&apos;.*
Splitter
*Show him the letter you found in Mordus&apos; cellar.*
I can&apos;t bear the burning any longer. Please, save us!
We teleported Gawin out of Fort Joy, but he broke the agreement and ran off.
You should know by now to obey your superior, Magister - whatever she may ask.
Treachery and collusion... I&apos;ll have Reimond&apos;s head for this.
You have no concept of what you&apos;ve done.
The Mother stands tall.
Yeah, but Master Arhu&apos;s gone. He went away with the smelly man.
