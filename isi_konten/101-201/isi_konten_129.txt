*The child whimpers, poking at a paternal instinct you&apos;ve rarely acknowledged.*
(If he doesn&apos;t have the ingredients he&apos;ll have to find Arrabella and take them off her, won&apos;t he?)
*He stares deeply into your eyes.*
Just get yourself masked up. I&apos;m not terribly keen on that... toothy grin of yours.
*As the flame gutters out, a voice cries out in anger. A spirit, bound for oblivion. And then it is gone.*
Woof!
What a shame. All this wealth&apos;s just been going to waste...
*The goddess&apos;s tears still stream freely, and an aura of immutable dread permeates the moist,  gaping air.*

I know because I&apos;ve known others like you: those whose fates are chained, for better or for worse, to that of the gods themselves.
*Wonder if this is what love feels like...*
[LOHSE] *Tell him there may be good reason for that. Perhaps you just don&apos;t have much in common.*
&lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;.
BACAW! Peeper isn&apos;t Peeper! Peeper is a... a... MONSTER!
You know it!
I am summoned. Speak the password.
Truth be told, I couldn&apos;t have done it without your help.

Dallis will succeed. You and your kind will fall.
Blessings come today. Blessings from the trees. From the gods. From all.
During the war, Ifan took the elves a portal device to save them from a Deathfog attack. But he was too late...
Thank you for your help with that &lt;i&gt;thug&lt;/i&gt;. Humans hate us both the same here. It is so strange...
*The squirrel absentmindedly runs a paw over Quercus&apos; spine. The air fills with the sound of soft, dusty purring.*
I find our thief. Death is the only proper punishment for criminals like you!
Magister&apos;s Journal
*A haughty-looking Undead woman - &lt;i&gt;unmasked&lt;/i&gt; - surveys the ground around her, seeking something. Suddenly, her head swivels and she trains an imperious gaze upon you.*
You won&apos;t take it off me! You won&apos;t take it off me!
*Resist arrest.*
*Look at her in frustration. They can&apos;t stay in this swamp forever - what does she suggest?*
I&apos;ve plenty of fighters for hire - experts in blades, bows and bewitchment.
*Tell her that you can deliver a message - what is it?*
Blue Noxious Bulb
Not... &lt;i&gt;one. HAHAHA.&lt;/i&gt;
Thassa spirit. How about just one more? Penny for a sick dog? Dog&apos;s sick, after all.

The Empress was my first champion. She laid the path for those who would follow.
*Fib that Meistr Siva sent you. She said he might be able to help you.*

*Note it sounds that he&apos;s trusting his instincts that Higba isn&apos;t responsible - how sure can he really be...?*
Wait. Before you go.
Stay lit, dammit!
Do not doubt my power. I merely &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; you gone! You are gone! BEGONE!
Embrace who you really are. Why did you become a crusader in the first place? You heard my call. &lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; call, not Lucian&apos;s. So fight for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
Let&apos;s get out of here, chief.
*Ask her about this &apos;ritual&apos;.*
Huh? What? But I was - it was... Please, tell me, tell me, *ahem* WHY did you wake me? I was so close... so close...
Well - not as ignorant as you look, are you? Yes, Marcus. The Order comes for the Kingdom, and so it must be silenced. It is the only way.

Be well, Fane. Good-bye.
Heh. I&apos;m right chuffed to have my supplies back, so I&apos;m gonna give you one last chance.

&apos;Horrors&apos;, eh? Easy to say when you haven&apos;t looked a Voidwoken in the eye. The Order - and their &lt;i&gt;horrors &lt;/i&gt;- are all that&apos;s protecting you from that fate. You and everyone else in Rivellon.
Kemm wants to enter Lucian&apos;s crypt; Dallis says to allow no-one inside. That the Order still stands is a miracle of Lucian himself. Thus far I have denied all persons entry. Yet even if I were to allow him to enter, Kemm would perish in the attempt: the engineers ensured the defences more than adequate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cannot help but question the Divine&apos;s wisdom. The Void threatens to swallow us all; would it not be better to share the powers of Divinity with all of Rivellon than to leave them buried with Lucian?
[SCHOLAR] *Bow and tell him you&apos;ve been sent here as an expert on these ruins.*
Whittled from Lucullan timber and wound with bright silken ribbon, this versatile staff is as well-crafted as it is powerful.
I don&apos;t believe we have anything further to say to each other, child of men.
*Say you&apos;re touched she trusted you with the song that controls her scar.*
&apos;A lonely traveller did pass,&lt;br&gt;We found her lying in the grass.&lt;br&gt;We saw the smile upon her face.&lt;br&gt;And gave her a final resting-place.&apos;
*The way forward is suddenly clear to you: You must ascend. Only a god could rid the world of the demons that plague it. That god will be you.*
*It&apos;s a one-man job. A job &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; man wants. Your sly-eyed troop leader holds out straws to you and the others. Who will investigate?*
*Keep distracting the White Magister. He should tell you all about this Hannag...*
*Say it was you who undid Braccus&apos; magic. You who released the captain himself.*
That was... lovely. Thank you. Your compassion means everything.
*Tell him that Alexandar is already dead.*
With Amadia silent, the priestess Gratiana left the swamps and re-entered the world. With more undead than ever before, she founded an abbey in the Dragonspine mountains, offering them shelter from hatred and fear.
A new dawn, a new day. Now to get control of this barge before sundown!
Hardly. I cry for peace; they yearn for war. They stray from civilised thought, ignore the lessons and memories of the fallen.
*Remark that she&apos;s too well-heeled to be some homeless drunk, and ask what happened to her.*
I hear half-witted ogres give better excuses than that!
Dark paths lead only to tragedy. He needs a divine light to lead the way. I pray he finds just that.
*Stay put. After all, he has a flair for drama.*

*Decline his request. You&apos;ll go where you want.*
Peep?
Be not frightened of me, delicate fleshed one. There&apos;s far worse than &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; bite in this quagmire.
She don&apos;t listen to reason! Maybe you&apos;ll have better luck than I. If I have to hear her callin&apos; after Erma another day, I might lose my head. And there&apos;s not a soul here who&apos;d blame me!
I am not one to break an oath lightly. But I am also not one to ignore the truth, not when it&apos;s written in my own blood. The Void nears. I&apos;d sooner the future be in the hands of a Godwoken than with the Black Ring.
No more words. The Arena will decide.
*Admit it. You&apos;re the Scion killer.*
*Tell Slane you&apos;ve changed your mind. You want to keep Radeka&apos;s Purging Wand.*
*Mention you&apos;re still unclear on why you need to be the one to do this. Are his legs broken?*

The door let us through. The captain&apos;s quarters are free for us to explore.
*Ask who that voice belongs to.*
*The spirit still doesn&apos;t see you, but he seems to sense encroaching oblivion. He closes his eyes.*
You... you &lt;i&gt;fiend!&lt;/i&gt;
I see my people safe again. Thanks to you.
In Braccus Rex&apos;s old armoury we may find means to defeat the Shriekers.

*The cook looks wounded for a moment... then draws a knife.*
As Source flooded Rivellon, Fane set out to record everything he could of this new world. As he travelled, he kept a socket peeled for signs of the Eternals, hoping to find the wife he&apos;d lost. He&apos;s still looking.
*Say you&apos;ve learned what you set out to learn, and you know the way to the Nameless Isle.*
*Sigh.* This is my mistake. You are no pig. I am no bull. Please - just leave us.

*As your vision clears you realise that the spirit before you is... or was... a childhood slave. Old Stinky went on to become a poisoner known as &apos;The Black Widowmaker&apos;, shunned by all the Houses. *
Yeah, dollface is right! Why don&apos;t you show us some balls then, Yer Highness? Can&apos;t do what you came here for without &apos;em, can you?
*The &apos;Sourcerer&apos; screams and runs away. &apos;Dallis&apos; and &apos;Alexandar&apos; in hot pursuit, all three children laughing.*
Bust of Alexandar
Let me mark your chart... but you be warned - stay off the wreck itself. Let her lie as a monument to her dead crew, and as testament to my mistake.
You... you must hurry. I hear it singing to me.
You assume I&apos;m a fool!
My soul is bound to joyless obedience. Purged of my Source by the wickedest of witches, I stand in thrall to her every whim. She has only to command, and my traitorous body complies...
*The imp God rolls her eyes, throwing you an exaggerated bow before she fades to nothing.*
A Voidwoken attack left the Ancient Empire consulate in Arx burning. In the garden, we found a portal to a twisted magical realm.

What do you want, elf? You can&apos;t just come in here as you please - there&apos;s Magisters missing; I&apos;m trying to conduct a bloody investigation!
You look for a fight, so I bring it to you!
We always knew Gareth was fated for greatness. As a boy, he&apos;d leap through the fields with wooden sword in hand, slaying imaginary demons, protecting us from whatever evil he would dream up.
As it should be. Now, I return to my prayer.
Stay away from Shriekers if you want to live. I know not how much longer my friends here have...
Oh, you pay for trying to weasel your way out of this one!
We’ve found a few pages that were ripped from a book.
&lt;i&gt;And you, lizard-&lt;/i&gt;slaver? &lt;i&gt;Do you come to chain&lt;/i&gt;-bind-burn? &lt;i&gt;We have a vessel already.&lt;/i&gt;
*You won&apos;t relent. Consume her spirit.*
Oh. You... you poor thing. That can&apos;t have been easy.
Oh like all good things in life, one has to experience these things firsthand.
