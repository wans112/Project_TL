Its value exceeds my limit
Do I need to repeat myself? Hands. Off.
*Glance at the remaining wounded, and note that she has her work cut out for her.*
What are we, friends now?
*Reach out a consoling hand.*
Apply to charmable equipment.
Imagine it, Godwoken. A pure and perfect world. Cowards will no longer beg for scraps at warriors&apos; feet. The fruits of our own labour will belong only to &lt;i&gt;us.&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;scuse me.
I suppose we ought to inspect the accommodation...
Eh...? You just &lt;i&gt;watch yourself&lt;/i&gt; - get me? Now clear off.
*Wonder how the Magisters got their hands on that kind of technology.*
Pure
Go, tell Malady everything that you know. Hurry!
*The hooded man exudes an aura of restrained menace. As he raises his head, the hood falls back, revealing the gleaming bone visage of the undead.*
What have you done, you monster? You feed upon spirits like a carrion bird...? I should never have helped you - get away from me!
*Offer him a poisoned fish.*
Buy
GODS MAKE IT STOP!
Lightning Rod
*Beast&apos;s spirit smiles as you approach and begins to sing a tune you think vaguely familiar.*
&lt;i&gt;There, you see? Let go - welcome home.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
A rather fine painting of Lucian in his younger days.
*The spirit speaks of freedom. How can you help?*
And the Magisters pointed their fingers at me.
Search
Some kind of mad healer - a real piece of work. I know she can cure the sick - saw it with my own eyes. Don&apos;t blame Justinia for wantin&apos; someone like that around.
*The symbols will curse anyone that dares near. This chest cannot open unless the magic is dispelled.*
Civilization
They simply asked what I was doing there, and I simply told them to begone from my lands.
Get lost, ben-Mezd. I don&apos;t care who you think you are, I&apos;m done with you.
*Nod. So that&apos;s how Braccus became so powerful - draining Source from his enemies.*
This is your last chance. Abandon this folly. Leave, and never return.
I am &lt;i&gt;dead!&lt;/i&gt; Dead, in a spider&apos;s lair!
Go with Tir-Cendellius. One day I make us a new home. But now - I must listen. My armour finds its spore-mates.
*Tell Malady the ship is active and ready to sail.*
*Your strike makes the lizard recoil, but he soon regains his bearing. Slowly he draws his weapon.*
Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many.
I&apos;m torn, Your Highness. I should return the drudanae and set the elf free, but... I really *cough* &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want to dream. And see...
It is! It is! But I know what I&apos;m doing! I&apos;ve been working this crossing my whole death! &lt;i&gt;Trust me.&lt;/i&gt;
If the Shield can hold up its end of the bargain, we might just have a chance to complete our research. We might make it yet, Quercus.
*The spirit stares at her transparent hands, dazed.*
*There&apos;s a moment of fleeting suspicion as his glove closes around the bones of your hand, but only a moment. He grins darkly.*
Yes?
*Wish him well and step away.*
Why did the Magisters jail you, witch?
I am the Doctor. I treat diseases of the body, mind, and soul - as well as the diseases that befall this plane and others. Isbeil is a symptom of a sickness needing a cure.
Please wait before sending another message
It is a blessed day. A day I thought I would never see. A day filled with possibility...
See that, mossy? If we don&apos;t have &lt;i&gt;order&lt;/i&gt; here, we won&apos;t even survive long enough to get cured by the Reds. Surprised you lent a hand. Well done.
We ventured on, leaving Dorian Gall and his scheming behind.
The pages of this journal are crusted with dirt.
You must do better than that to buy my silence.
The High Seas
Grand Duke Gregorius of the Emerald Isle
Chapter 1 - The Merryweather
We have learned that Vredeman is in fact Braccus Rex, resurrected by Dallis so that she could use him to acquire the Aeteran. We&apos;ll have to exercise extreme caution when confronting her, if she has the mad Sourcerer king as a lackey...
Ancient history... can it have been so long already? Gods, how the time flies...
Just one more drink, and then I&apos;ll be off. Just one more...
Ha! More the fool you! Day is night and night is day in Fort Joy, O noble one! The Magisters are the royalty around here! You&apos;ll learn yer true place yet.
Have you heard tell of this wicked beast on your travels?
I lived in the Forbidden City, a vast complex of palaces that houses the royal family and its servants. No others are allowed to enter it. As for myself, I was never allowed &lt;i&gt;out.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrug and say maybe you can. You are a Sourcerer after all.*
*Watch her carefully. Sourcerers like the Mistake?*
Black Wax
Speak with the Knight of Amadia.
In return, I ask for one courtesy: a kiss.
Have I got anything that needs a good firing?
Mordus transformed himself into a large Voidwoken. We had to kill him.
For the Void has spread everywhere - from empires to hamlets - from kings to peasants, it corrupts all things.
A quick death would be a blessing to these unfortunates.
*He blanks you once more.*
Who&apos;re you? Nobody. Hah.
*Ask if you might get more tea leaves from her.*
*Grin and admit it - it was a total guess.*
Rhino Die
I wasn&apos;t prepared for battle!
An empire built upon the backs of slaves...
So it is you, is it? Prepare to die, thief!
*Curse at her and take your leave.*
He&apos;d prefer to speak for himself.
Noble Hat
And I&apos;ll tell you where my secret stash is.
I... wish I didn&apos;t have to say that.
You will not walk away from me with that jar in your hands. You will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;.
Excellent. We&apos;ll need some privacy, of course. I know a place worthy of royalty, a place where we might kindle our flames.
The Deathfog is flowing. It is no less relentless than the wind itself.
*So all magic users are the descendants of gods? You feel pretty pleased about that.*
*Say you won&apos;t stand for this. There must be a way to save her still!*
Crawwurgh.
Paladins
*Tell him you found a knight of the kin there, but he was already dead.*
You mean everything that &lt;i&gt;didn&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;happen.
*A jolt of cursed fire flares from her staff.*
High Tier Blank Water Skillbook
Wizard Mitts
We failed to find Meistr Siva and left Reaper&apos;s Coast for the Nameless Isle. It&apos;s time for a Godwoken to become Divine.
*She eyes your outstretched hand warily.*
Bark! Bark! Bark!
It is a &lt;i&gt;living &lt;/i&gt;face, isn&apos;t it? Ah... I see that perhaps it is not. Still, yours is the first face I&apos;ve seen in an eternity.
[HERO] *Comfort the spirit. There is no shame in imperfection.*
The kind that don&apos;t fancy starving along with the rest of this town.
That shrine seems to have brought me here.
He is a lizard. No doubt he slithers close to the temple of his fork-tongued goddess. Beware, for he brings the shadows with him.
Great! Gimme gimme gimme.
Meagre brains think meagre thoughts. They sully the air, like offal. I prefer to keep my distance.
as the world battled the demons?
Left Cmd
What- what&apos;s going on...
Travel Chest
Back to refill your quiver, are you?
*Order him to tell you what he knows about the God King.*
*Wonder if they&apos;ve found anything important.*
[IFAN] *Ask if he has any advice for how to proceed.*
I do enjoy swinging a claymore and see heads pop like corks; blood spouting like sparkling wine. If that&apos;s the sort of thing you&apos;re after.
Violent storms crashing through a country idyll. Perhaps the artist meant it as a metaphor for the Divine Order&apos;s sweep through Rivellon?
*The wood is covered in a scratchy, scrawled handwriting. It&apos;s hard to read, but you can just about make out the recipe for a spell.*
Ifan and I killed Alexandar. This time he&apos;s gone for good.
The Watcher is dead.
Yes, we certainly had better, but until the ship is moving, we&apos;re quite stuck, aren&apos;t we.
[HERO] *Gently suggest that fear is a bigger enemy than anything that stalks the land.*
You&apos;re all shiny and stuff!
Here, I will detail my complaints about the poor conditions in this prison: the food is bad, the guards are cruel and the cells are... [the rest of the text is obscured by red ink, and the following lines have been added in a shaky hand: the food is excellent, the guards are fair and the cells are really quite lovely - obviously the writer had a mysterious and sudden change of heart]
Look alive. The Hammer should be with us shortly.
Something smells funny...
*Your head suddenly feels swamped - filled with a consciousness other than your own.*
*The spirit of a woman cowers before you. She has her hand clamped over her mouth in a desperate effort to stifle the whimpering...*
Ok - wait. Before we go any farther... There&apos;s something I want to ask you.
He might not have killed those Magisters, but he&apos;s still a Sourcerer. And that means he&apos;s still a threat.
Bronze Scale Boots
*Of course your hand passes right through her. You back away and shrug awkwardly. The spirit&apos;s expression changes in an instant - utterly composed and thoroughly unimpressed.*
Oh, &lt;i&gt;clever&lt;/i&gt;. Book-clever it seems - not the same as true wits, but useful nonetheless.
Duna, god of the Dwarves. Did they really need such a big painting?
It... it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a little spooky here, though. Right?
Cap&apos;n Ablewether
Ha - I&apos;ll take it!
It&apos;s just that I - well - I felt nothing.
Comma
Best avoid any open flames around this lot.
*The proprietress gives you a sweet smile.*
*He scans you from head to toe, then rests his eyes on yours.*
[ELF] *Allow her to feel your anger at the way Borris treated you...*
I&apos;ll bet you did. S&apos;why you let me get close enough to nip some gold right outta your pouch, right?
*The Magister remains oblivious to you.*
Yes, my prince! I, the goddess, I who created you, tremble!
I hope you&apos;ve changed your mind, Sourcerer. It would be a true blessing!
Aha!
Shove off!
That... Hannag woman. After Gwyd met her... that&apos;s when the *sob* trouble started.
*Tell her your every waking moment is focused on finding a way to get it out of you.*
*Tell him he&apos;s dead. The time for ringing is past.*
I was one of their order once. I was an acolyte of the Great Acorn.
*Remove your hand. Say that&apos;s hardly fair.*
*Smile and say you feel the same.*
Sebille. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
*Nod. You&apos;re not sure how she recognised you, but you are indeed a Godwoken.*
Make it stop!
*Ask who this master is.*
Repair the mechanism.
Braccus
*Give him a long, cool look. Then smile. Lean over and kiss him. It was worth it.*
Elven Staff
*Agree. Too many laws keep people under the thumb of authority.*
Sourcerer! Sourcerer! YOU!
*Pause. He was in the Order? As in, the Divine Order?*
*Tell her you found the egg, but it was broken.*
A &apos;meowntain&apos;. Heehee!
*The puppet is still and silent.*
*Tell him you read a book about the Lone Wolves: &apos;Claws of Deceit&apos; - was that story about Roost really &lt;i&gt;true?!*&lt;/i&gt;
*Demon skin? Demand he explain how he could possibly know such things.*
It gives me almost as much pleasure to speak to you as it does to be whole again.
I&apos;ll... just wait here, then.
*Xhaxh. What is this creature, exactly?*
How &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; you address your betters like that? I should cut you down where I stand.
Spirit of an Elderly Mage
Hatch to the Arena
*Beast sighs halfheartedly, and absentmindedly begins to twist three strands of beard hair into a braid.*
