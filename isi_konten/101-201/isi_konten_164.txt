&lt;b&gt;Map of the Vicinity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This map details the eastern regions of Reaper&apos;s Coast, with etchings marked harshly into the delicate drawings of the landscape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The etchings show:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stonegarden&lt;/i&gt; to the east&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paradise Downs&lt;/i&gt; to the north-east&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blackpits&lt;/i&gt; to the south-east

*Her eyes suddenly flash with fury, then fade back to normal.*
They were buried in the crypt,

Where better to find a clue about the Great Acorn? Some of those trees could even date back to the first forest...
*Ask him for one good reason why you should let him live.*
Easy now - you&apos;re paler&apos;n me arse. Whyn&apos;t you move along.
Guarding this land from your kind, Sourcerer. Keeping to a promise that our master made.
If we&apos;re not careful, we&apos;ll burn the world.
Eyes sharp, Paladin. The Grandmaster&apos;s chamber must be protected.
*Express surprise at seeing him alive. Didn&apos;t he &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt; on the ship that brought you to Fort Joy?*
The truth of your motives eludes me, as if shrouded in mist. I pray that seeing the Devourer&apos;s true form is enough to convince you.
*Sigh deeply and say you were hoping she&apos;d have understood your sarcasm by now. You don&apos;t intend to marry an animated puddle of sludge born from some demonic slug&apos;s rectum.*
Thank... you...
*Tell him to give you the highlights.*
I&apos;d bet my lucky left foot Mordus is in the cave. You&apos;ve got to get to him before he gets his hands on that cargo.
*Tighten your grip on the will. No can do.*
*Hold their attention with the meat, and reach out to take the gem.*
I think you have your answer.
*Wonder how he ended up in a barrel in the first place.*
*It lays there gasping, dying, drowning in the sunshine and its own blood.*
The Void&apos;s been defeated plenty of times. If that&apos;s what did this to the gods, then we have to seek out the means to stop it.
*The dwarf cocks his head left, then right. His eyes squint and his brows rise as if lifted by an unseen fish-hook.*
*Lady Kemm smiles graciously, and offers you a cup of tea.*
We won&apos;t be escaping with Gawin.

Please... I beg you...

A tall, tall tower...
Added value
W-what? Why do you sneak up on me?! Don&apos;t you know how dangerous that is, the way things are?

You! You travel with Sebille. I must speak with her very urgently!
*Sir Lora nods in return and grabs your pinky with his tiny paw. He gives it a decisive shake, then salutes.*
Magisters. Up to no good, no doubt.
*Express your sympathies, and suggest that perhaps he&apos;ll get reassigned soon.*
It is said that if you successfully pass the Path of Blood, you will become the next Divine. Enough incentive for some, to risk near-certain death.
Soon. Very soon.

We didn&apos;t chat with Rory for long, but he sure seems hungry.

It&apos;s time to find a new home, it seems.
*Raise an eyebrow and tell him there&apos;s another Voidwoken on the bridge &lt;i&gt;riiiiiiiight&lt;/i&gt; behind him.*
If it is the Seven&apos;s will, than so be it. I will carry on.
*She stares at you thoughtfully, stroking her chin.*
*As the feeling dissipates, a cold sensation slips down your spine. Something otherworldly lingers behind you.*
Evade, trick, battle, or otherwise deal with the Black Ring.
Lamenting Abomination
To be leaving. Now. Forward coming, an arrow in the heart flying. Go!
Very well. My fallen brothers shall have their justice.
*Look around. Admit that you&apos;re tempted...*
Here now! Have you a reason for barging into my room, sir? When one&apos;s in a small town, one must expect small town manners, I see.
There&apos;s no rules in that arena. Murga&apos;s used some low tricks to stay on top, if you understand me...
They looked like Lohar&apos;s crew. But... did you see their eyes?
Serrated Twohander
*He gives you a nervous grin.*
[NOBLE] *Sneer. You&apos;re no baseborn gambler.*
*Stop him before he leaves. What can he tell you about the Hannag person he mentioned?*
My god returned me to the Lady Vengeance. I should look for Malady.
Busted Twohander
Guarding the cells... this is a job for a bloody recruit!
Painting of a Landscape
Who said anything about fear? I hardly know the meaning of the word!
Dragon Egg
*Shake your head and draw your weapon. You don&apos;t trust him.*
Storm-dreamer
Red Prince! I very much appreciate the gesture of goodwill that is Sebille. Shows me you can negotiate. Shows me how far you&apos;re willing to go for your own private interests.
*Shake your head. You&apos;re in charge here.*
*Grunt with disinterest, and say that all you care about right now is finding a way off this island.*
*You slip on your spectacles and hold the parchment to your eyes. As the script comes into focus, you see the words &apos;Black Ring&apos; near the bottom - and you are thrust into reality to become fully &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
You know... wherever the next road leads, I guess. I never was one to sit in one place too long.
*Embedded in the stone stands an ancient and venerable sword, as sharp and as strong as the day it was made.*
*It painstakingly attempts to flap its wings, to no effect. You catch a glimpse of its weak little torso - a faint glow emits from &lt;i&gt;within it&lt;/i&gt;, like a cooling ember...*
As for the absolute truth, the prospect both tickles and terrifies me.
I am clear enough the first time. Get out of here!
*Malady groans, her face twisting in pain. She falls to one knee, catching herself on her hands.*
Yes! You know the Ancestor Trees, but the spores are... more. Older.

Mody&apos;s Playhouse
Nurse Si
O&apos;en the chest! O&apos;EN IT!
*Ask her if she thinks she&apos;d make for a good goddess.*
Alright, then. Apologies for the delay, you may step inside. I warn you, though, it&apos;s no party in there.
But... I was wrong, of course.
Life is too long.
Bear Cub

Even when my people walked this land, a dropped apple still fell to the ground.
Magister Roe
*You suddenly feel pain - blinding, burning pain. Your screams have been reduced to hoarse whimpers. You&apos;re too weak to struggle against your chains anymore.*
My friend, the very best lovers are, as you must have suspected... &lt;i&gt;kin. &lt;/i&gt;And for a sizeable sum of gold, I can introduce you to the greatest lizard lover the world has ever seen. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Never trust a merc to do a Magister&apos;s job. No conviction. Alright lads, we&apos;re still on here! Look lively!
Leave him alone, Gill! This one&apos;s mine!
*Tell him divinity will be yours and yours alone.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll do anything you can to look after her, then ask where you should start.*
It&apos;s good for a man to have a trade. At least for me. The Lone Wolves gave me purpose when I needed just that.
No less than a slaughter, my prince. Nobles from the three houses were gathered there in anticipation of Lucian&apos;s Day when suddenly the Red Princess walked in, accompanied by no other than Brahmos the Wanderer.
*Ifan steps closer, pressing into you with the whole length of his body as he wraps strong arms around you. He&apos;s so &lt;i&gt;warm&lt;/i&gt;, and a rich scent rises from him: storms and leather.*
*Probe for more information. What happened to the real Dallis?*
*Say that everyone is a traitor to &lt;i&gt;someone.*&lt;/i&gt;
Cloud in sync
*He reaches out and gently strokes your cheek.*
Huh. Yes, survival. Harder than- than you&apos;d think maybe. Harder than- than-
This is Griff&apos;s key. Stained with old soup and mush, it looks like it fell in the camp stew one too many times.
Yeuch. Ack. Why did you have to pick this up? Now it&apos;s all over your backpack. Ew...
*Tell him you don&apos;t intend to fail.*
*You see him coming for you. You saw what he did to the others. You pray, you pray, you pray, you pray...*
Take up the mantle, Red Prince, and all will be well.
I am your servant, Mistress... but my hull is shattered. My end is near.
*He casually waves his hand and suddenly all around you is black. You see only his face, large as a mountain, looking down upon you. When his mouth opens it&apos;s like you&apos;re staring into a toothed volcano.*
*Say that despite the apparent irony, you&apos;re the only one strong enough to secure her freedom. With you by her side she can make it back to the mainland.*
MONSTER! BOCK-BOCK-&lt;i&gt;BABY KILLER!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you&apos;ve heard of Shriekers, but you&apos;ve yet to see one.*

Search Dallis&apos; cabin.
*Even though her tormentor is dead, the Magister is still paralysed with fear. Her mind is gone.*

YOU SWORE, CHILD! &lt;i&gt;OPEN THE VALVE!&lt;/i&gt;
*Give Almira the Swornbreaker.*
Heart of Steel Skillbook
*The jar seems quieter now. It sits still.*
I thought I&apos;d seen the worst that life can offer. I was wrong.
*Say that he was trying to kill her father. You had no choice.*
A Black Ring mirror? If I had anything of the Black Ring, it would be a war trophy, nothing more.
*Ask what had happened to the elf.*
Shove off, cannibal.
I will fulfil this desire. In return, I ask for one thing in return...
Well. Looks like you came here for business, didn&apos;t you.
&apos;s our honey. Bog off.
Large Memory Potion
Yes, Your Holiness?
Scaly Phoenix Egg
*A scruffy man lounges against the wall with scarred arms folded. A sly smile playing on his face, he stares across at the Magister guarding him. Noticing you, he straightens and beckons for you to come closer.*
*You feel a jolt and open your eyes to see the soul jar before you, lying still in the vault. Your hand falls from the jar and grips the pillar as you try to calm your ragged breathing.*
Your soul has become a vast enough expanse to house divine power. You are ready.
Have you no respect, daughter? No respect at all? You should...
Disembodied Foot
[HUMAN] *Chant a prayer of comfort. &apos;May the lost be found and the broken mended.&apos;*
I can&apos;t talk now... I have to prepare...
*Reach out to touch the device she is tinkering with.*
*Demand to know who he is. Why is &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;protecting the Godwoken?*
*Assure him you&apos;re a friend. He can trust you.*
Hush - it&apos;s okay. It didn&apos;t hurt.
The Wanderer
You! Sebille! She who must be blamed!
