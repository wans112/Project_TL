Aww. The strapping dwarf&apos;s as weak as a kitten. There there. It&apos;ll be okay.
Lucian blesses me in his own way, limb-licker. I glide on his breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
She&apos;s an appraiser, and our boss to boot. You&apos;ll meet her if you head inside. If you&apos;ve got anything she&apos;s interested in, could be she&apos;ll make you a good deal!
[SCHOLAR] *Tell Tarquin of the spirit&apos;s words - and the heirloom&apos;s response.*
I know who you are. I know the weakness of your heart!
We must tell Malady when we&apos;re ready to sail for Reaper&apos;s Coast.
Forged In Fire
When we get outta this place, I owe you a pint!
It seems we under estimated the cur. Very well, thank you for your efforts. Fruitless as they were...
On we go! The living have no place here.
*The spirit looks to you, confused.*
*Give him the bad news. His friend Jonathan is responsible.*
[This manuscript about the goddess Amadia is - or was - clearly in progress.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Goddess Amadia was an outsider, preferring to live in complete solitude. As the millennia passed, the six races spread over the continent, and one day she had a dalliance with a wizard. This coupling resulted in the birth of several demigods. She granted her lover immortality and decided that she would act as the patron mother of all wizards. Although wizards are not considered a separate race, many are proud to worship Amadia as the mother of all magic.
Well, &lt;i&gt;sort of&lt;/i&gt;... but by all means let that be a motivator, not a cause for concern.
My parents were... killed. Tragically. It was an accident.
Check to always show the split item interface when you are selling items to a trader. Otherwise, the entire stack will be sold and you&apos;ll have to hold a key to split the stack while dragging.
What can I do for ya?
*The creature has two fingers crammed in its mouth. With a faint pop, it pulls out a rotted molar and lets it fall to the ground.*
As far as I&apos;m concerned, you are noble and just - in both actions and appearance. I am in your debt.
Ryker&apos;s Rest - Private Chambers
Look, I don&apos;t have a problem that means I can&apos;t tell the truth, and I don&apos;t want you to help me fix it.
*Tell him he&apos;s not as dead as he thinks: he still recognised your beauty. Doesn&apos;t he want to do right by a lady, like you assume he used to?*
Homemade Crossbow
*Suddenly you are warm. &lt;i&gt;Extremely &lt;/i&gt;warm. Your vision clouds and you feel faint. Strange creatures appear before you - wraiths, writhing smoky in the air, attracted by your fever.*
*Note that the cage seems to have been inadequate. You&apos;ll have to kill him.*
Passing through a glowing portal, we found ourselves in a war-torn desert.
I... That wasn&apos;t quite the reply I was expecting. How very magnanimous of you.
Sanders is the expert. But once you claim the amulet and the scroll, I&apos;ll explain how to use them.
*The man wags his finger in your face.*
This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; vengeance! The one who forced you to kill wants all Scions dead. If you become the mother, new Scions rise and he is defeated!
the God King was pushed back into the very depths of the Void.
[JESTER] *Nod and say he&apos;d better get cured right away, before the neighbourhood&apos;s lost for good.*
[IFAN] *You grudgingly comply.*
Now, now. Let&apos;s not be unkind. And don&apos;t change the subject.
*Tell her you need to think.*
Attributes
*It&apos;s a crystal blade seemingly separated from its hilt. You feel magic flowing through it, but it&apos;s vague and undirected.*
I don&apos;t want to go to the cellar, &lt;i&gt;please!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him that you want to know where you &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;are.*
Can&apos;t keep your hands off things that don&apos;t belong to you, huh? You&apos;re coming with me.
*Respond that you don&apos;t know anything about a ring.*
You shall, of course, be paid. Use it well. Or badly, I care not which.
Both, I fear.
Dark Fighting Axe
I know Isbeil will kill you if she gets the chance, Beast. You must kill her first. Shall we join forces?
The Black Ring ended my vigil. They came, intent on destroying this place; I fought them off as long as I could... but there were too many.
*Keep advancing on the Magister, who shows no sign of defending himself.*
Wonder if we&apos;ll get to meet the ringmaster himself...
We came across an elf beset by Magisters on a shipwreck. We joined the fight.
Hmm... Perhaps you do know best.
*You&apos;ve been wondering about Kemm&apos;s vault. Say you have something to discuss.*
I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;you would&apos;ve.
Moonlight
Those were the days, eh chum? Well - I&apos;ve gotta get movin&apos;. Good t&apos;see a friendly face, though. Ain&apos;t too many wanderin&apos; around this glum camp!
My Source was his lifeblood. Now my hunger must be sated. &lt;i&gt;My soul will be mine again.&lt;/i&gt;
What was I thinking? One minute, they&apos;re living their lives. Playing with their children, meeting with friends, singing and praying. And the next... gone.
Hmmm? Oh, you catch me during a meditative moment.
From Gear: [1][2]%
Tarquin found the new Rivellon... unchallenging.
*She lets loose a long sigh. She inhales. She sighs again.*
That&apos;s something I want an answer to myself.
*Remark how surprised you are. The God King keeps secrets from her? Tsk-tsk.*
We broke the seal of the Blazing Sculpture, revealing a passage leading into a vault.
Crooks, cads, and &lt;i&gt;saps&lt;/i&gt;. You&apos;re the one who let me get close enough to nip gold right outta your pouch.
You&apos;re amazing. And you won&apos;t regret this. I... can&apos;t say I know what it&apos;ll be like to be the Divine, but I know it&apos;ll be better than &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;.
I have welcomed many into this place. Even those who did not seem fit to receive Amadia&apos;s grace.
She didn&apos;t do anything wrong - she was just trying to save lives, but no-one will listen! You have to help, please!
*There is no sign of life from the altar. You run your hand across the lunar rune carved into its surface and walk away.*
This does not reflect well on the Doctor, I have to say. I mean, if you get a cake as a gift from a city notable you have a right to expect it to not try to kill you.
Let&apos;s do this.
I prayed at an altar and found myself in the Hall of Echoes.
[LIZARD] *Tell him there are whispers of his exploits, even in the Ancient Empire. He was outcast for trying to overthrow the dwarves&apos; Queen Justinia - right?*
You&apos;ve got some nerve, using Source around here! You&apos;re coming with me.
You&apos;re under arrest, Sourcerer! Let&apos;s get you to prison, where you belong.
*Unsheathe your weapon and thrust your letter in his face. You&apos;re here for answers.*
[IFAN] *Tell him he&apos;s deluded. He must know that his actions prove he&apos;s not fit to be the Divine.*
Go on. Be safe.
Adramahlihk... Adramahlihk... Adramahlihk...
When it is complete, perhaps we walk among the Ancestor Trees together.
[HERO] *Say you can hear the fear in his voice. Ask him what he&apos;s so afraid of.*
Spirit of Seaman Stubbs
*The lute is absolutely familiar in your hands, as though it weren&apos;t an instrument of wood and sinew but of your own flesh and soul.*
*Repeat that you haven&apos;t encountered anyone called Wainslow - Magister or otherwise.*
Kannox&apos;s Key
Arrow Or Shaft
You again? I told you to scram once... don&apos;t make me say it with my fists.
&apos;Let it Be known Henceforth to each and ev&apos;ry Subject Here and Everywhere, that...&apos;
*The spirit throws its arms out, pleading. A stream of unheard prayers flows past as her eyes beg you not to.*
Kraken
*Ask him who he thinks you are.*
It does. There is an intelligence guiding that darkness.
Such a powerful relic is worth protecting.
Are those &lt;i&gt;bite marks?&lt;/i&gt; Good gods...
*Say you know there&apos;s more to it - you just want to hear her side of the story.*
Luckiest guess I ever saw. I reckon I&apos;m gonna let you in, just because of that. Don&apos;t go causing no trouble, mind. I&apos;m doing you a favour here. And don&apos;t expect a party. People have died.
I beg to deliciously differ...
Deal accepted. But keep your hands to yourself from now on.
*Snap at her: she doesn&apos;t know what in the seven hells she&apos;s talking about!*
Run! Run away!
Aborting...
Damn! The Djinn&apos;s necklace was stolen, then.
*Point to the tree and wonder what he&apos;s doing.*
* - a flicker of movement catches your eye. Something alongside the ship, beneath the water&apos;s surface... a writhing mass of huge tentacles. You reach for your weapon...*
Close
But when he does, you will &lt;i&gt;beg &lt;/i&gt;for the sweet aroma of death.
You must think I&apos;m stupid not to see through your blatant lies. You&apos;re under arrest, fool.
*Rhalic nourishes himself from the Source that abounds in your presence. You feel it, deep down inside yourself.*
*Say you&apos;ll make it worth his while.*
Focus not on death and irony, my prince: on life and ascension instead.
Are you ready to... atone?
Please help me get out, I just want to go to the beach and play with my shells again... but that grate is too heavy for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
I&apos;d rather not cross the God King. Not yet. Better to kill Sadha than to face his wrath.
We fought Dallis on the high seas. Vredeman fought with her, and fought well. He is no ordinary Sourcerer.

You linger still. Those who linger in this place die.
Nurse La
*Point to your more-than-ample backpack. Does he need to see your weapon collection for him to divulge what he knows?*
Creates a poison cloud with a [1] radius. Creates a small oil puddle with a [2] radius.
What would we do, Quercus? Why, we&apos;d make them sorry they ever left their mother&apos;s nests.
Abyssal Void Predator
Meistr Siva is one of a rare breed: She&apos;d do anything in the name of a cause, and her cause happens to be &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. She&apos;s desperate to meet a living Godwoken. She&apos;ll be exceedingly pleased we&apos;re on route.
I see the bad in you! Haaaaah! You can be on your way!
*Turn away. She will do as she must - as will you. You answer not to a queen, but to the ocean.*
Earth resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
Bock!
I want to aid you, of course, my lord. Indeed I &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to aid you! But I am in just as desperate a need of my... medicine.
Gareth... please come back...
Remember what I said - touch &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.
You claim such power, but still need my help to pass through a door...?
Now you see it, now you don&apos;t.
Splitting Party Members
*The White Magister turns to the Sourcerer and shouts loudly enough for the entire valley to hear.*
I guess that&apos;s a new kind of freedom. Maybe not the freedom to be... &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;. But the freedom to choose which company to keep.

Magister Julian was not pleased to hear that Lohar&apos;s head had been eaten.
