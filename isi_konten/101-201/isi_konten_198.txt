*The dragon rakes the earth with icy claws. Quakes from the impact knock you back.*
*He smirks as he raises tree-trunk sized arms overhead and lunges for you. Somehow, you get the feeling that you&apos;re actually giving him what he really wanted all along: an enemy.*
Talk to the Scion.
Rusty Great Axe
Your words mean nothing to me, Alexandar!
Mounds
*The rat squeaks somewhat aggressively, its mouth wet from gorging on corpses.*
*Ask what possessed him to put the armour on at all.*
*The woman&apos;s breathing grows stronger, more even. Colour flushes her cheeks.*
*Ask what they&apos;re doing in this place.*
*Your face feels nearly numb; the first two drinks are hitting you hard. Feeling bold, you take the third glass and swallow down the ale inside.*
Bandit Mage
If we are quite finished with &lt;i&gt;politeness&lt;/i&gt;, there is so much to do.
You should get out of here. They&apos;re looking for you!
*Offer a prayer to your own god for the repose of Sarias&apos;s soul.*
You still sniffing around trying to get into this house?
*Kill her.*
Coyote
*Ask about this Amyro.*
It&apos;s when I saw the ink that timid thoughts of rebellion first bloomed. Back in my dark room I dipped the needle that killed the scholar in his own ink, and engraved his name in my skin.
Divinity beckons...
Speak with the man of the house.
Tarquin&apos;s Whereabouts
May our child reduce our foes to ashes!
Consume oil surfaces around you and convert them to Physical Armour. Removes Slowed.
A dragon...? No - I will not allow it! THAT THING DIES WITH YOU!
It&apos;s good to give myself a rest. Those masks can be darned pesky.
Firm Handshake
What kind of person doesn&apos;t need the lie?
Let&apos;s do good. Both of us. We may as well serve as examples to the god we call our friend.
*Having chosen not to extinguish the souls at the demon&apos;s home plane, Lohse looks at her party, her mouth set to a frown...*
As such, my husband might know better than I.
Bloodied Arm
*Laugh. How can a god be submissive?*
Come, now. Do you mistake me for a cannibal? I assure you my interests are quite academic. Why, the very essence of decay flavours many an essential oil. An utter pity you don&apos;t understand.
I&apos;m gonna send you to be cured, Sourcerer!
Latin Spanish
*Answer with a kiss, then all the rest.*
We put Reaper&apos;s Coast and Bloodmoon Island behind us.
A bar of pure silver that, hammered out, would surely make a fine, sharp something for the experienced weaponeer.
*Tell the spirit to stop its gibbering. You&apos;re here for a reason.*
Truly? At least then we would not have let a murderer slip through our fingers. Quite interesting...
Well then, has your mind sufficiently woken up to dare attempt my challenge?
Here we are. Here we are! My mother and I have much to say to you. We wait for her.
You cannot fail, Godwoken; not for anything.
*You recognise the design. The pedestal is from your own era - but unlike Aetera, it has kept its strength. Empty now, it once supported something powerful. Something now missing.*
Mari died in the Voidwoken attack.
*Tell him you&apos;re still working on getting that spell.*
You understand &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt;. And there is something my heart, such as it is, is set on.
&apos;Driftwood - Home of The Black Bull Tavern&apos;
*Take your leave.*
*Pull your hand away. Tell him the deal&apos;s off.*
Sshhhhh, no need to SHOUT ABOUT IT! It&apos;s just a little tiny eensy mite of a smidgen of whatever can keep me awake. NO sleep! If I can just keep my eyes... &lt;i&gt;open...&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;ll be... safe.
*Apologise. It was pandemonium out there. All you thought of was survival.*
Alright then. You can pass. But I suggest you don&apos;t. I suggest you turn around and head another direction entirely.
Decomposing Terramancer
*Sourcerer King? So he means to become Red Rex, is that it? A second Braccus?*
*Threaten to break the door down.*
Was the freedom you promised merely another cruel joke of your kind?
Of course, in your case, the terms are slightly different. No blood, and all - but your marrow will do. That&apos;s the original stake, plus one half, repaid on demand, or you die. And know this - no-one owes me money for long.
Dunaâ€™s Undertaker gave us several of its feathers.
*As she catches sight of you, recognition flashes in her terrified eyes. She drops her hands from her throat and starts hyperventilating.*
*Reason that if he&apos;s thinking of leaving, then this is the best chance he&apos;ll get - you won&apos;t tell anyone... and neither will the Silent Monks...*
*Sigh. Is this going to be another attempt on your life? Because they&apos;re a frightful bore, frankly.*
What... what IS that? And dear gods, what&apos;s he eating...
A strange being called an Eternal, whose dead civilisation once ruled the world, spoke of the Aeteran as an Eternal device.
*She smiles and hugs you again.*
Latest news! Fresh from the war owl! Hear all about it!
Keeping this one safe &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;my business.
Striking language. Smart writing is a forgotten art.
You&apos;re just digging yourself in deeper, aren&apos;t you? I&apos;ve had it.
*Ifan raises his eyebrows, but shakes his head at your attempts to communicate, glancing sideways at the angry face of Magister Viktar.*
Cursor-Focused Movement
Magister&apos;s Orders
Go away, you smelly little thing.
We&apos;re &lt;i&gt;guarding&lt;/i&gt; it.
*Softly she moves her body against yours, puts her arms around your neck; her mouth hot against your ear.*
I would not be surprised if sickness had spread across the isle. The doctor was surely ill to risk all that he&apos;s built here.
You found an unidentified item! Identify it with an &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;identifying glass&lt;/font&gt;, but you will need &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Loremaster&lt;/font&gt; points to do it. Or you could just pay a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;trader&lt;/font&gt; to do it for you.
You will decay forever. Well earned.
*Tell him that Murga&apos;s not around anymore - but you&apos;d still like to fight.*
*The owl addressed as &apos;Jimmy&apos; lies motionless on the ground, looking for all the world like he&apos;s stone cold dead.*
The gelatinous eye quivers, its pupils dilating as though adjusting to sight once more.
*...but then withdraws it with a chuckle and a wagging finger, as if to chastise your greed.*
*Slowly reach for your weapon.*
Old Leather Armour
*Gareth? Tell him you know of a Seeker by that name. He&apos;s passed away, though.*
Magical Double Bit Two-Handed Axe

Strengthens your Physical Armour.
*Slowly reach out a hand in an attempt to show the beast you mean no harm.*
Effort_Lg_2
True. You did not ask for it. I ask it of you. Because I know you can bear this burden. I know you are worthy.
...their dignity has all but left to rot.
*A waif-thin elf peers at you from over an imperious, hooked nose. Deep darkness circles both his eyes; disdain etches his face into a sneer.*
You&apos;re back! Good. I&apos;m ready for my tweezing.
The dead here stir. I hear their whispers.
No... I am bound by powerful magic. Try to free me a-and... &lt;i&gt;uurrggh&lt;/i&gt;... and it will likely kill me...
*Ask if she&apos;s investigating her fellow Magisters as well. One of them could have easily done this.*
*The shrine starts to vibrate and glow, slabs of stone gliding across each other as it begins to open...*
&lt;i&gt;NO! WE ARE ONE! WE ARE WHOLE!&lt;/i&gt;
Emanating arcane energy, this mask makes the wearer appear to be a human.
We found the place where Garvan&apos;s mentor died. There are indeed signs of violence.
[RED PRINCE] *You recognise the scar as a lizard slave mark, but it&apos;s not your family&apos;s design. There&apos;s no reason for her to hate you.*
Unidentify
&lt;i&gt;*...or to sacrifice.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him no. You prefer more casual encounters.*
*Tell her her master was a bad man and it&apos;s a good thing that he&apos;s dead.*
*Ask him if he has any other family in town.*
Get lost. I don&apos;t have time for your chirping.
Don&apos;t be sorry on my behalf. Be sorry for Rosewood. And his wife. He was a good man, and she&apos;ll feel his loss. It&apos;ll haunt her the rest of her days.
I don&apos;t know how to s-say it. I just feel it.
We opened a sarcophagus, freeing a strange, ancient being that called itself an Eternal. She seemed to be quite dismayed to lay eyes on us, as we bear the likeness of &apos;the Seven lords&apos;. The being noted that our gods must have won their conflict with her kind after they sealed her in this place, and remarked that we, their creations, seem to be little more than &apos;Source Vats&apos;. Just what is this &apos;Eternal&apos;? And what does she mean...?
How could you?! Help!
Never fear, petal. Gareth will be back soon. There ain&apos;t no scrape too tough for him.
Damn right. I got a right to live, don&apos;t I? Throw &apos;em in a hole for all I care. It&apos;s the greater good.
Someone disappears in the middle of a conversation. Odd... be on your guard.
*Wonder about Jonathan. Is... is that who he&apos;s burying?*
You seen that spore anywhere? Looks like a big bloody seed.
The ritual took me to the Hall of Echoes, where my god sought refuge from the Void in my very soul.
Coo! How did you know that?!
Ungh. Don&apos;t. Say. Anything.
But... does this feel right to you?
Bead
*Solid and immobile, the Silent Monk abides.*
Very good. Now, on the subject of that stew...
Two-Handed Sword
Server shutting down
We chose what was right. I pray you do the same.
Ugh. I know three whole syllables can be a challenge, but do at least &lt;i&gt;try.&lt;/i&gt;
[1] gives [2]% more Vitality when being resurrected (stacks).
Item Stats
Find Lovrik&apos;s child Livy in the kitchen.
*You peck at the dirt, waddling past two Magisters complaining about how difficult it is to catch a canary, but the spry insect skitters away. And the Magisters think they have problems...*
Mind yourself in the streets, citizen. Our home has become a warzone.
Even if you&apos;re not, I&apos;ll wager you still aren&apos;t too keen on sticking around to enjoy their &lt;i&gt;&apos;good intentions&apos; &lt;/i&gt;for long.
*Attack the murderous brute. You can&apos;t allow more lives to be lost!*
[DWARF] *Say that there&apos;s plenty of your own kind around here - you&apos;ll manage.*
I&apos;m no pirate. I just play the part. I prefer &apos;revolutionary&apos;. Got a nice ring to it.
*The creatures follows your movements with a jerking gaze. You wonder if it might lunge at you at any moment.*
Fine by me, it&apos;s your funeral. This boat&apos;s my ticket out of here - and there&apos;s room on board for a friend or two. Feeling any friendlier?
So Dallis leads the Order. *Spits.*
Mordus. He wears a cloak of skin but rots from the inside out. Seems the two of you have something in common, yes?
I can only imagine all the terrible ways he mangled them before he finally killed them.  It must have been so... &lt;i&gt;extravagant&lt;/i&gt;.
Source Rack
Very well, Godwoken. Tell me, what do you wish for?
Campaign
Keep walkin&apos;, freshie.
That&apos;s a hell of a way to express it.
*Tell him that a dark entity called the God King possessed his puppets and used them to attack you.*
*First, you fight the Void. Then, you accept it. And, finally, you welcome it. You are one with this realm, and it is one with you.*
Ah, my word! Canniest sappers on Rivellon!
The Voidwoken&apos;s wreakin&apos; havoc. Get in there, and get it under control!
*You are the hand. You are the hand that hurts, the hand that kills, the hand that &lt;i&gt;bleeds them dry&lt;/i&gt;. You are the hand that listens to Magister Timort&apos;s head.*
Camera Left
I intend to find out.
*Tell him you&apos;ll take the job.*
Arrow Spray
[UNDEAD] *Tell him Death does not offer a fight, but a... cold embrace.*
