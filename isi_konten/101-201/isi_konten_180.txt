I imagine the gentle ones were captured already. Collared and shipped to Fort Joy. But those deemed too dangerous or insane to confront may have been left alone.
Come, we don&apos;t have time to waste on the doomed.
*Leave her be.*
*The Magister spirit dashes along the foliage beneath the battlements, nearing the bridge. There is a cry from behind - the spirit glances back.*
[JESTER] *Tell her that the sugar plum fairy forbade you from sharing any of the secrets she taught you.*
Get away from my stuff or I&apos;ll kill you. Got it?
The ritual itself is quite simple: drop some blackroot in the bowl, mix in a little blood, set the concoction aflame, and then inhale the smoke.
We offered to help Gareth find out who killed his parents.
*You realise a nearby Magister has had his heart cut out, and the reaver&apos;s gauntlet is bloodied. The reaver begins to laugh...*
*Tell him you expected something like this would happen.*
&lt;i&gt;&apos;I call to the souls of the dead.&lt;br&gt;Your remains, the Stonegarden&apos;s eternal burden,&lt;br&gt;Descend from the Hall!&lt;br&gt;Surrender your Source to the vessel before me!&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
I warned you!
Well, well! What have we here? A fresh face in this stale hell. Let&apos;s size you up, shall we? See if you&apos;ll do.
The Crossleys all died.
*Leave the spirit be.*
*Admit, wide-eyed, that&apos;s exactly right...*
Consider it a taste of your Divine future. The people will pray for you. In turn, they&apos;ll trust you to do right by them - as I&apos;m trusting you to do now.
Wolf
Don&apos;t yow bother. It&apos;s the God King&apos;s island now.
Shrine
It may sound stupid, given the world in which we find ourselves, but I strive for balance and a realm in which all creatures can feel safe, and free of terror. Hence my alliance with Lucian.
Decorated Key
If your queen could hear you, she&apos;d have your head. We need a Divine, or the Voidwoken will take us all. I hope Bishop Alexandar ascends soon...
And done!
Really? I didn&apos;t think you liked anyone.
But maybe it&apos;s going to work out. I&apos;ve got a contract, a man on the inside... and now &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
Sure. If you don&apos;t know who did it, a Lone Wolf did it.
Carrot
Target cannot be resurrected.
*Note that she&apos;s terribly stubborn. What&apos;s she&apos;s hiding?*
We used Source Vampirism to consume every spirit bound to the Devourer armour. Its true power is now ours.
The bad things unner the sand are gone now... but things still smell fishy so they do.
&lt;i&gt;Goodbye, Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
You expect me to believe that?
*The dragon&apos;s bulky skull has empty eye sockets, but you can still feel the weight of the Devourer&apos;s gaze, trying to force you to kneel.*
&lt;i&gt;*Allow? &lt;/i&gt;What a word. Tell him Lohse&apos;s the one who won&apos;t allow that demon to win.*
You understand when you meet him. After you escape.
This&apos;n&apos;s mine. You can have one a&apos; Lord&apos;s. He&apos;s too fat anyway.
I am... &lt;i&gt;was &lt;/i&gt;a librarian in Arx, for the glory of the Order. The Ring came, burnt my library to the ground. My books... they are all I have... &lt;i&gt;ALL I HAD&lt;/i&gt;. I had to save them.
Another life, snuffed out after mere decades. How horrifying.
Changes Incarnate&apos;s element to blessed ice, unlocking Restoration and Steam Lance.
Blessed mother, bringer of magic, I pray for these Sourcerers.
*Ask what the deal is with the pig - Lulabelle.*
Spirit of Knight of Tir-Cendelius
If I were  you, I wouldn&apos;t pay any heed to the ramblings of that fool.
Even all those powers will barely be enough to defeat the King.
Sweet thing. Succulent thing. We are so pleased to see you, but not as pleased as him.
You must be taught a lesson. Help! Over here!
Deal with the Deathfog.
*The automaton looms above you. A lone, glowing eye takes you in dispassionately.*
Yes... Relish in your lust for power, just as a god should!
I told you before that if you don&apos;t treat me with the deference I deserve, I will leave you to your own devices.
She just... showed up one day. When she knocked, we figured it must be time. The Order had come for me. But it wasn&apos;t a Magister who&apos;d called, not that day. It was a lizard.
*Say that it&apos;s only fair that you pay this time.*
Edit
There you are. You found me.
*Cut him off. That&apos;s the least convincing act you&apos;ve ever heard.*
Action Points
*The white rabbit again considers you like you&apos;re a particularly odd specimen.*
You honour me, to embrace me as kin, despite my... mutilation. I thank you.
[FANE] *You survey the barrels and spot something as you leave- some crude mortal script?*
Aha! There&apos;s something behind this painting...
Then an elf would know whose flesh he&apos;s supposedly consumed. Do you know?
And what kind of Divine was Sebille, as the world battled on?
*Roll your eyes. At least you&apos;ve control of &lt;i&gt;them.*&lt;/i&gt;
But... my eyes. Come... please. What if there&apos;s... permanent damage?
Be on your way, then.
*Say that it reminded you of someone you once knew. You just wanted to reminisce.*
*Standing at the centre of the room you spot a Sourcerer haughtily eyeing a pair of nervous-looking Magisters. They keep their crossbow trained upon her as she&apos;s being interrogated by an officer.*
I have no illusions that history will look kindly upon me. My only goal is to guarantee that someone should survive to write such histories.
*She fingers the mask covering her face. For a moment it seems as though she&apos;s about to remove it, but instead she places a hand on your shoulder.*
Last warning. Come snooping around here again, and I won&apos;t be so forgiving.
Manage target
*The well is now filled to the brim with fresh, cool water, but what it has brought to the surface quickly evaporates any wish you may have had to quench your own thirst.*
Pfft. &lt;i&gt;Fine.&lt;/i&gt;
[IFAN] *Tell him that sounds like the kind of megalomaniacal talk that led Lucian to his end.*
*Lay a hand to your weapon; this fiend is dangerous.*
*The cat moves forward, twisting around your legs and filling the air with the sound of dry, dusty purring.*
You have returned here too early, Ifan. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
Let&apos;s hope the Order mistakes me for a loyal.
Ah, I knew there was a kinship of sorts about you. Same trade, different masters, it looks like. If you&apos;re willing, we could work well together.
Work together? I was locked in this hell for trying to fix your mistakes, and now you want me to help ease your conscience?
Do you think giants understand chivalric orders? Can they conceive of honour? Of faith?
*The flower has gone quiet.*
Bye then!
Do mind your manners here. Lady Kemm would not be pleased if the fineries went missing.
You see our pet magister? Mind you do not join her.
*As soon as you respond in kind to her threat, she blanches and drops her blade. Terror in her eyes, she stumbles away from you.*
How quaint.
*Move your hand a palms-width along the top of the plinth.*
*Smile and play along. Go down on one knee and bow to her.*
*He resumes his laughter, and you&apos;re left wondering if the pig truly had a better handle on finance concerns than Ros&apos; own daughter.*
Waypoint Discovered
*Say the journal has been more confusing than helpful.*
Please cut off its breath, then bring me its heart!
*Tell him you must be on your way.*
&lt;i&gt;Betraying &lt;/i&gt;the dwarves? Oh you poor, snivelling idiots.
Maddening Song
*The totem stares at you. There&apos;s a certain sense of wakefulness present in its features.*
Dangerous waters lie ahead. Be sure you&apos;ve chosen keen travel companions, for this may be your last chance to change your party.
Restores Source Points whenever a player character rests.
Half A Sword
*Giggle. It sounds like true love.*
The Shadow Prince
Poisoned Cold Fries
Morning&apos;s Light
Wear these sacred feathers with pride. Honour us, as our souls honoured Duna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[JESTER] *Sing something better.*
All my life I&apos;ve been a performer, a musician; beloved and celebrated by all. But I have a secret: I&apos;m also a playground for sprites and spirits and... worse.
Go, my prince. Find the Well of Ascension. Do what must be done.
*The bizarre creature before you seems to be gurgling plaintively, almost as if it&apos;s... weeping.*
*Tell him to hand that armour over to you. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.*
*The spirit takes another furtive sip from his wine.*
Fishworks Cellar
By the bishop&apos;s bones, you saw it? Out with it, man! What happened?
You don&apos;t have any items that can be enchanted right now.
Hurry up. There&apos;s isn&apos;t much time left.
&lt;i&gt;There is no other way. The Source of the world is required to close the Veil. All of the Source.&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s a two-parter. First, I&apos;ll run a little favour for him - taking out an enemy of his called the Advocate - and he&apos;ll help me grow my capacity for Source. All the better to fight the demon with, according to him.
However, it may be worth taking your concerns up with Magister Carver. I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be interested to hear them.
Kaybo&apos;s Lustrous White Tea Leaves
The Temple
*Tell her that Sister Avenny trusted you enough to give you the key to Arhu&apos;s rooms. She should allow you to pass.*
The very same, for the sum of Source that flows through their festering flesh is more than enough to expand the sum that is yours.
*The Seeker&apos;s prayer is now the weakest of murmurs - completely unintelligible.*
Then one day it happened.
*Scowl and say it was a fair question - what difference could a bloody dwarf make?*
I cannot speak for her. But if I saw you and her together as we are now, I admit my heart would break.
I saw it all... Me, the Prime Scion, destined to be the heart that pulses at the centre of all Ancestor Trees.
You don&apos;t have enough Action Points to perform that action. &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;End your turn&lt;/font&gt; or perform an action that requires &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;fewer Action Points&lt;/font&gt;.
I don&apos;t require much from you. Just a small favour. Well, two, in fact.
Oh, my pardons! I fear I am rather unaccustomed to your... customs.
Moving to reinforcement deployer!
I&apos;m the only one with the guts. I deserve the glory.
The House of Shadows were closing in. The God King... he offered me a way out.
It&apos;s almost kind of cute, in a terribly morbid, deadly sort of way.
There is nothing on this isle as valuable as the air you breathe. Don&apos;t look for worth in metal and stone: to escape with one&apos;s soul is enough.
Fellhammer
*The spirit, mute, holds out his hand towards you, palm upwards in supplication, his eyes pleading.*
Yes, Vredeman. It is time.
*The spirit recoils in horror - but it&apos;s too late.*
I hope so, for all our sakes.
Meistr Siva
Spirit of Sebille
A sub-par cranium, that. Human. No wonder.
*Looking  at the barrel, you see that someone has scrawled &apos;Black House&apos; on it in paint. As you cast your eyes around, you see that every barrel headed to Arx has the same inscription.*
*Tell him to put his twigs away.*
It was paw.
We killed Captain Ablewether. Her spirit went to the Hall of Echoes.
A medium-sized potion capable of steeling you against the effects of air magic.
Get to it or get movin&apos;, brother. It&apos;s the busiest day of the year.
*If she held a compass she must have been the captain - ask her where her ship lies berthed.*
Alright... don&apos;t harm him - I&apos;ll be watching.
[IFAN] *Close your eyes; offer her nothing but the sharpness of silence.*
*Ask the Red Prince about what he makes of what happened: Sadha. The other king...*
