White Magister Jonathan&apos;s got the greenhorn on the ropes right now, no doubt. Only a matter of time before he blabs about that mentor of his. He&apos;ll talk. They always do.
Scepter of the Grand Judge
This chest opens for the words of Consul Zara. Not apes, not kin, not the Gods themselves.
House Interior - Basement C
*Ask why he cut out the dwarf&apos;s tongue.*
See everything from two sides. Take the wolf that saved you, that follows you so dutifully. &lt;i&gt;Watch&lt;/i&gt; him. The wildest animals often turn and bite the hand that feeds them...
The Eternal Aetera
Tell me, witch. Tell me about the Black Ring.
BY REQUEST OF THE DIVINE ORDER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certain Sourcerers known as &apos;Godwoken&apos; are to be identified upon the agreement of both parties to the terms of this contract. These &apos;Godwoken&apos; will be located by the contractor and disposed of in a timely, quiet, and seemly manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the nature of this contract, new names may be given on an ongoing basis. The amount claimable per name is fixed at ten thousand gold per head, to be paid immediately upon receipt of evidence of the task&apos;s completion.
Lohar is dead.
Elegant and functional, these slippery gloves can glide against any material without making even the hint of a sound.
Cursed Web
*Ask how she ended up here.*
[LOHSE] *Advise a bit of caution. Imagination tends to be more exciting than reality.*
If I did, I wouldn&apos;t give &apos;em up to you! Griff sent &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, not &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
Toggle Helmet
*Tell the rat you don&apos;t take orders from vermin.*
The job was supposed to be simple: Break into the vault, take the gold. The Rogue hadn&apos;t bothered to ask whose vault and whose gold it was - such questions were irrelevant. Cold, thick steel and shining, precious gold had no human element, after all. One could be coaxed into yielding, and the other could be delivered to whomever had ordered the job in exchange for a small fee or, on particularly ill-fated occasions, the Rogue&apos;s life. This job was, unfortunately, the latter. The vault&apos;s internal mechanisms clicked small high- and low-pitched sounds, satisfying to the practised ear. A few more manipulations, and - success! The rogue pulled open the great, heavy door just enough to slip inside. Noiselessly filling a satchel with gold, the thief had no time to react to the heavy hands that seized both busy shoulders. &apos;Well done,&apos; it said, turning the Rogue to face the voice&apos;s owner. &apos;But anyone so adept with a lockpick should be working for the realm, not against it.&apos; &apos;You did manage to catch me,&apos; the Rogue replied. &apos;I&apos;m the Grand Master of the Source Hunters,&apos; he laughed. &apos;I can catch anyone.&apos;
*Ask Fane why he&apos;s so ignorant about the world.*
Someone else might have believed your lies, but not me! Murderer!
You better get a handle on that thing. Because you will not be able to handle me.
*Furrow your brow in worry. Ask what else is happening.*
Oh, you need so much more than that. But it&apos;s a little late now, isn&apos;t it, darling?
Well... certainly, he was not pleased with my insistence that we investigate, but the King&apos;s word is law.
*A Black Ring captain stands before you. She looks remarkably ordinary, you think, as far as Black Ring go. But then you hear a voice inside your head.*
Run. If you know what&apos;s good for you, &lt;i&gt;run&lt;/i&gt;.
Just as Iâ€™d planned.
A primer on the undead. One page in particular is smeared with oily fingerprints.
The files of mod &apos;[1]&apos; and/or its dependencies are invalid. This can be caused by corrupt files or some files have been changed. You won&apos;t be able to play this mod in multiplayer.
[SEBILLE] *Note that as arsenals go, you&apos;ve seen seen deadlier sewing kits.*
*So, you say, the horses keep talking about the race they ran today, and the dog listens in.*
We killed the Shadow Prince. Sebille must now bring his heart to the Scion of the Mother Tree.
*Slug lays down two Pink Birds and a Grimley. Bottle Top folds. Ralvo sets down a set of four Purple Monarchs - that&apos;s one more than normally come in a deck. He&apos;s a dirty cheat - again.*
*Smile and rest your hand on his arm. He doesn&apos;t need to hurry. You&apos;re just getting to know each other!*
Destroys [1] each turn.
Players
*Tell him you don&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about.*
Repair level too low
Good day.
They just keep coming. Look around - there&apos;s got to be a way to make them stop!
*Tell her you can give her more limbs... if she has anything else to trade.*
Come down, Godwoken. COME DECAY.
*She goes silent, momentarily willing to let you go free - then rises from her bow and grips you by the shoulder.*
*Ask about &lt;i&gt;The Sacrifice of Lucian&lt;/i&gt; - can it be viewed somewhere?*
First Lucian, and now the great Arhu is no more... all is lost, I fear.
Primal Chaos
*You&apos;ve no appetite for music. Take your leave.*
The demon has a sssecret... We must know the sssecret...
*Offer a reasonable amount of gold.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
*The spirit of a Paladin lies stretched upon a rack, all four limbs pulled tautly away from his torso.*
*You disagree - dwarves are far better to the rest. You&apos;re loyal to Queen and country, and the hardest-working of all races.*
...they... they tore me apart and turned me into this &lt;i&gt;monstrosity&lt;/i&gt;.
I... ah, yes... I came from the Blackpits to... to &lt;i&gt;negotiate&lt;/i&gt; with Ryker here in his house. We needed to ensure that scoundrel wouldn&apos;t interfere with our plans there.
Blessed Smoke Cloud
[IFAN] *Say that you follow Rhalic, the god of your kind.*
Back
*The queen nods a goodbye to you.*
*Draw your weapon. You feel like avenging that spirit, just for the hell of it.*
My debt is paid. But... I worry about your heart. It can be good and bad. The time will come when you must choose between the many and the few. I hope that then you will remember your good heart.
*He drags a comb through his beard. His face bears the scars of a hearty life, but his whiskers glisten as if glazed by the morning dew.*
You. Eyes over here, yeah? I know she&apos;s pretty, but me wife&apos;s here t&apos;work, not t&apos;gawk at. Now what&apos;ll it be?
Play coy if you must, but sheer hunger will soon trump your all too delicate feelings.
My thanks for your help.
House Interior - Lair
It&apos;s just - they&apos;re my people. Although... well, so are you.
*Two candles glow with eerie, heatless light, unmelting black wax glistening in their glow.*
&lt;i&gt;You&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; not Magister Gremory. And your presence is... most unwelcome.
Surely it&apos;s obvious. Ascension awaits - once we manage to gain access to the actual Well of Ascension.
We wait, we wander and wonder, seeking signs from the gods...
Our search for Dallis led us to Lucian&apos;s tomb. There, all would be revealed.
It-... it is &lt;i&gt;rotting.&lt;/i&gt; Almost imperceptibly, but it decays before my eyes. It does not even have a century left!
But... you guess I need something, too.
*She nods in acknowledgement of the news, then turns away.*
*Consume the Captain&apos;s Source.*
Attacked Sourcerer
*Assure him that he doesn&apos;t need to lie.*
Deadly Spores
Someone&apos;s been making a real mess around here. It wasn&apos;t you, was it?
Oh, do you still not see? There is no such thing as too much of your wild abandon!
Sickeningly-Familiar Blood Vial
Dwarven Hideout
*Ask him if there&apos;s anything you can do to lower the cost.*
Now that&apos;s the spirit! How &apos;bout one of your old hits? How did it go? &apos;Come to me the night is dark&apos;...
Forgive me if I don&apos;t take your word for it.
He&apos;s at peace now. It couldn&apos;t be helped.
Problem solved.
But... but wait! There&apos;s still people down there!
Thank you for your help, sister.
Is that a threat?
*Say you have no interest in becoming the Divine. Really.*
Eye For An Eye
*...and with a rending, tearing sound that seems to fill the whole wide world, your military skills and bearing - as much a part of you as was your soldier&apos;s heart - is torn away, and you are left bereft.*
[Translate74_f545fafb-ff0b-4ba4-9f0b-57328b4f8f5d]
That I know. I don&apos;t blame you. But the fact remains: she is dead, for no reason.
*Rub your fingers together in the universal symbol for bribery.*
Who do you think - ARGH!
*Say the journal hasn&apos;t been as clear as it could be.*
I intend to rule an empire one day, not a tiny outcropping in the sea, lording over gulls and guppy fish.
*Say you slipped an island full of Magisters. You&apos;re unstoppable.*
They were kept in vaults across this island. The Seeker Gareth left to find one earlier, but has not returned.
Improvised Shovel
Even dead, I don&apos;t get no peace. You need something?
*Fane nods slowly, lost in thought.*
We already know the truth, Magister. Now speak!
*Say nothing. Allow him to make his own mind up.*
*Roll the word around in your mouth. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. It&apos;s got a surprisingly nice ring to it.*
Still, I wonder if...
*Step away. There&apos;s no helping him.*
*There&apos;s no denying what you saw: The Black Ring itself is hunting you - or at least paying others to do so. It&apos;s impossible to tell who might be working for them. You eye your companions...*
Yes... Relish in your lust for power, just like a god should!
The figure in the portrait is rendered with a careful hand. Its eyes seem to follow wherever you go.
*Ask if he knew the dead man.*
*Broach the subject of Amadia again.*
*Now others must make &lt;i&gt;their &lt;/i&gt;choices too.*
But above all, above any of them, I cherish &lt;i&gt;her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Her eyes flash and sparkle with tears. She quickly wipes them away and feigns kicking you down a road.*
[LIZARD] *Ask how Ghonghi responded.*
Mordus disagreed, obviously. But thanks to you, he&apos;s dead.
Scroll Text
Then you&apos;ll decide what their undying loyalty is worth to you. And if it ain&apos;t worth your life, than you ain&apos;t deservin&apos; of the ship you pilot. Simple as that.
Grog the Troll
*Ignore her remark, hoping she&apos;ll drop the subject.*
One shouldn&apos;t tempt a prince&apos;s patience. It is not our strong suit.
Either I see that bag, or you see the inside of a cell. Your call.
That was Brendyn. When the ship wouldn&apos;t answer my call, he touched the figurehead... and it attacked him, without warning. He burned like he was made of parchment...
[NOBLE] *You are a man of your word. Tell Lohar you&apos;ll do your part if he does his.*
*You feel peaceful in her presence; soothed somehow by an intangible comfort.*
I&apos;m appalled. When the Magisters were running this place, more than five hundred prisoners went missing... and ended up in the hands of the Black Ring. &lt;i&gt;For experimentation.&lt;/i&gt;
*Drain the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Enough. Next time you try that, I am not so nice about it.
Cell Key
*Pat your bag. The parts will stay there, safe and sound.*
Milk
Leave. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;.
We defeated Alexandar. Ifan has fulfilled his contract.
Get bent.
*Ask what Lone Wolves are doing out here in the back end of nowhere.*
My dear sweet boy, I&apos;ve grown to trust you. More than I&apos;ve trusted anyone since...
The moment of truth approaches, does it not? All is decided soon.
Round here you&apos;re the enemy until you&apos;ve convinced us otherwise. So no, I don&apos;t trust you as far as I could roll you. Good day. Don&apos;t let the door hit you on your way out.
Alexandar is missing.
I&apos;m not too keen on this particular companion, of course. But I can&apos;t remember a stretch of longer&apos;n a few days that there wasn&apos;t some kind of lodger knocking around up there.
Gods be damned. Now it&apos;s gonna leave a mess, and I&apos;m gonna have to clean it up.
