I owe you an apology, Shield. At the start of our journey, I wouldn&apos;t have believed a &lt;i&gt;human  &lt;/i&gt;would lead me to the discovery that would save us all.
This is a tavern. People are drinking. Eventually there&apos;ll be a fight. You planning on starting one?
Guardian Angel
Because it will be a turning point in the history of our people... but its outcome is not yet set in stone. Our Empire can weather all storms, with the right guiding hand.
So damn cold... I haven&apos;t felt warm in weeks.
*Tell her you won&apos;t let her down.*
*Let your hand drop away from his. You&apos;re sorry, but you can&apos;t.*
I had wondered how long it would take you to get to that. But first, let me say -
Another escapee from Fort Joy? Glad &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; made it here in one piece, unlike me. Any idea what you&apos;re gonna do next?
Sylun Erinson
*Kneeling before you is the spirit of a priest - an &lt;i&gt;orc &lt;/i&gt;priest. He produces an ornate dagger and slices open the palm of his hand. Around him, a sound suddenly rises to a &lt;i&gt;roar&lt;/i&gt;...*
We are never united. Never truly one. But the Ancestor makes more spores, and we &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; one - do you see? &lt;i&gt;Everyone.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that if he shouts the words, &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;do the clapping.*
*You feel a cold terror settle into your bones. What is she talking about?*
*Ask if he&apos;d like you to remove the pain of his grief. You are Divine, after all.*
Strange. Perhaps you met with the Seven lords, then. My my, I am in more illustrious company than I suspected!
You. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; might succeed.
The Dreamer has fallen in the Hall of Echoes. We&apos;ve been forced out of the dragon&apos;s dream and have no way back.
*She goes white - as white as the proverbial ghost.*
*Tell her you&apos;re merely curious. Did it hurt when they placed it on her?*
They still live? If you cannot see them slain, then I will.
Server Name
I wish I could tell them I love them. Just one last time...
There is no time - we must go!
...I mean, transporting this entire vessel to the Hall of Echoes itself? This place is &lt;i&gt;fascinating! &lt;/i&gt;What I wouldn&apos;t give to roam around it freely, make some observations...
An elaborate Dwarven longbow emblazoned with the insignia of Justinia&apos;s own regiment.
Do not wish for such a curse. That kind of power corrupts the mind as well as the soul. Braccus discovered that too late...
*Tell him Tir-Cendelius is a little more... direct.*
...
Do not vanish from me in this way!
*Inform her that Isbeil is dead.*
*Beg her to answer your question.*
*As you examine yourself, you see the top of a small elven child&apos;s head as she approaches. She wraps her arms around you and rests her head against your great trunk.*
Marg the troll suggested we kill Grog.
By turning your back, you sentence us all to death - me, you, the Seekers. &lt;i&gt;If you let Alexandar rise.&lt;/i&gt;..
*Focus on the spirit.*
Hmm...
There is no better city in the world than Arx, stranger. Arx &lt;i&gt;endures.&lt;/i&gt;
*Note that you&apos;ve already seen him use telekinesis. Who knows what else he might be capable of.*
My pawn? No. My &lt;i&gt;champion&lt;/i&gt;.
Mallet
*Shake your head. He has you confused with someone else.*
As you know, the House of Shadows stirs. Assassins had me cornered. And so I took the last, desperate action left open to me: I fled bodily into the dream realm. This is my world now. To Rivellon I can never return.
And now I must wait for some &lt;i&gt;lesser&lt;/i&gt; creature to ingest the rest of me. Hmph!
*The kids turn back to the water. Ben picks his nose.*
Stand clear of the flames, there.
*You remember the empty plinth at Xantezza&apos;s temple...*
Head for the foreshore.
There&apos;s only one thing to do. I&apos;ve got to set you free. Your collar: Let me take it off.
*Tell him the missive was signed with a single S. The letter glowed with a pale light as if alive.*
Yes, my sweet, you were glorious. The clack of your bone against mine will live with me forever.
*The child smiles at you and continues her game.*
*Take your leave.*
*Chuckle, and say you&apos;re no fugitive... though you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; up for other kinds of trouble.*
And so I find out. My goal is to... have a goal, if that makes sense at all. And if it doesn&apos;t, well - that&apos;s all I&apos;ve got.
*The spirit offers no resistance. He just closes his eyes and accepts his fate.*
*Say that that&apos;s unfortunate and take your leave.*
Pressley&apos;s Key
*Gasp* Vandal!
By Duna&apos;s dagger, elf! You here to free us, or kill us?
*Stay silent. You will do as you see fit yourself, not as this vampiric wretch commands.*
Oh, of course! Here, this is the most powerful scroll that I have. And the one that caused all the trouble in the first place. Take it, I hope I never see  its like again!
Let&apos;s carry on! See how many history books we can make it into.
*Say you promise to fulfill any demands or concerns she has - once &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ve &lt;/i&gt;ascended.*
Nameless knight
*Nod and step back. You&apos;re more than happy to let him handle this one.*
You&apos;ve served your purpose. You&apos;re dismissed.
Try again.
*Lie, and say that you have unique powers that can cure the girl, if he lets you in.*
Very clever.
I owe you my thanks for paving the way. When we made our little deal, I had no idea of the things you had done. I had no idea who you really were. Do &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;know who you really are?
I will take no pleasure in this.
I can only hope you seek me out anew because your sword has seen to justice after all.
*Squeak.*
Well, er, I should leave you to your devices.
No... I see them. The servants of the King. The forces of the Void. They&apos;re- they&apos;re here.
*Say you can&apos;t blame him. For all the Order&apos;s bluster, things are only getting worse.*
*As your hand wraps around her arm, your fingers squeeze down not on skin and flesh, but on solid bone. Through her robes, you can feel that she&apos;s nothing but a skeleton.*
Excellent. We&apos;ll need some privacy, of course. I know a place worthy of royalty, a place where we might kindle our flames.
*Look over their meagre meal and say you&apos;d feel bad about sharing what little food they have.*
How I have missed you mortals! So small minded. So focused on things of no consequence. It has been too long.

The dwarves, notalldwarves, but mostlydwarves come. They add they take they read yes they scrollread they putandreadandleaveandcomeandleave.
*The image flickers and fades to a hazy sheen once more, and the pressure vanishes.*
Arx became a great metropolis, famed for its prosperity, its culture, its diversity, and the willingness of its denizens to stab each other in the back for the slightest advantage.
*She seems about to respond, then stops. She shakes her head and places a hand on your shoulder.*
I did not find a dreamer in Driftwood. Perhaps I shall have more luck on the Nameless Isle.
With things as they are, it seems you worship nothing at all. What a lonely life that must be.
Magical Dwarven Hammer
Sebille... To behold you in this naked glory is to surmount the boundaries of existence and step into a more perfect universe.
*Ask how he knows you&apos;re Godwoken.*
Lead the way.
After defeating Captain Zapor, we took all of his enchanted armour.
Some fool talks to people and teleports away in the middle of a conversation. Suspicious... keep your wits about you.
[SCHOLAR] *Say that you recognise those incisions - the work of a healer or a scholar, not some fishmonger.*
Thugs brought &apos;em here to rest. Can&apos;t say why. Maybe they had some sense of honour. The spirits aren&apos;t gettin&apos; much rest though. Still fightin&apos; over the queen. A sister convinced Justinia&apos;s a tyrant, a brother convinced his own sibling&apos;s a traitor.
Use the key to escape.
The east and west chapels contain the most breathtaking art, by the finest artists. Lucian and the Seven before him are represented most faithfully. Perhaps a meditation in their presence would soothe you?
*Braccus Rex? Ask what evil the mad king&apos;s wrought upon him.*
You are in the presence of &lt;i&gt;your queen.&lt;/i&gt; Her Highness is due proper respect from her loyal subjects.
Oh, Gareth. He was always so devoted - and so &lt;i&gt;stubborn.&lt;/i&gt; In this form, his faith won&apos;t falter. The ideal servant.
Someone, over here! Murderer on the loose!
*Ask why he was being tortured so.*
Let&apos;s try something jaunty. This should speed things along!
Smokescreen Arrowhead
Turns out... turns out it was drudanae messing with me. Stronger stuff than I&apos;m used to. Also turns out &lt;i&gt;some people&lt;/i&gt; don&apos;t appreciate spectral wolves tearing up the place, so &lt;i&gt;some people&lt;/i&gt; called Magisters on me.
It&apos;s like I always said - everyone&apos;s got a melody in &apos;em - you just gotta look. Me brother Laslor couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket when he was a wee thing. Now, he&apos;s got the voice of an angel.
I flip the table and start scrambling for my crossbow. &lt;i&gt;Nowhere&lt;/i&gt; to be found... and by now the tiger&apos;s right on top of my eyeballs, so I do the only thing I can think of: I summon Afrit, my soul wolf.
Pet Power enhances the summoning class and its infusion spells immensely. With this mod, you can cast infusion spells on all available summons, not just your own Incarnate! Each summon receives different skills depending on the base elemental infusion type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
As that charming old nursery rhyme goes: if it can chop down a tree, it can chop off a head.
*Alexandar speaks with the insincere friendliness of a wizard selling spider venom and calling it a cure-all. &lt;i&gt;&apos;My boy. Gareth is dead to us, along with the rest of the Seekers.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
You can&apos;t lead all of lizard-kind out of the darkness if you&apos;re staring at the ground. I have  chosen you for this purpose.
Burning! Burning!
Splendid Tunic
Another pyramid!
*The crocodile remains slumped where you left him - still recovering from his ordeal.*
I learned that Sadha is in Arx, and was last seen travelling to the lizard consulate.
[1] turns
I love you.
He put up one hell of a fight, but we defeated White Magister Reimond.
*Say you heard the story of how he died. Quite the conflagration, rumour has it.*
*You&apos;ve seen machinery like this before, in the cave beneath the Blackpits. Here too, the apparatus thrums with power, and seems to pull you in.*
And you will see it soon, for we are out of time. The chase is on.
You just don&apos;t get it, do you? It&apos;s kill or be killed. Survive long enough and the Reds&apos;ll let you out. Ain&apos;t that worth killin&apos; for? That&apos;s all we&apos;ve got.
Money. Plenty of it. That&apos;s what the living care about, yes?
I recognise this place from a bit of flesh I tasted.
&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am the only one left who can save Lucian. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am His Holy Warrior. I am the one true loyalist! I am the TRUTH! I am the REAL! YOU ARE WRONG! YOU ARE THE MISTAKES! &lt;i&gt;ALL OF YOU ARE THE MISTAKES!&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit stands there smiling, as if she hadn&apos;t just uttered the words of demons. Luckily, you understood them: &lt;i&gt;Anathema seeks blood.*&lt;/i&gt;
Lingering Wounds
[SCHOLAR] *Admit that it&apos;s a first in all of Rivellon&apos;s history.*
You... you&apos;re a lizard, aren&apos;t you? You&apos;re not straw?
