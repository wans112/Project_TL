*Say: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Good riddance to bad rubbish.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Adapts to dangerous situations with transformational tricks of nature
Drinks (mug)
Send her back to the kingdom. She&apos;s their problem now - not ours.
You are hindered by your loyalty to yourself. You judge... nothing. You learn nothing. You who are not fit to judge, you earn nothing.
No carrots, no thyme, no taragon. I&apos;m fresh out!
But the Voidwoken attacks continued, as they did elsewhere.
High Quality Earth Essence
*A grim expression passes across her face as she looks out over the graveyard.*
And on top of it all, the stew was a disappointment!
There&apos;s no time. It is... it is angry now. You need to stop it. Now!
Now, I&apos;m just trying to get used to life as a pig. It&apos;s not so easy. I never did enjoy truffles.
We fixed the mechanism with a silver lever.
Criminal! Face your fate!
*Say that if she doesn&apos;t help the Seekers, they&apos;re all doomed. Surely there&apos;s something she can do?*
*Tell him you couldn&apos;t care less what happens to the Seven. This cosmic drama holds no interest for you.*
We will break your branches and ravage your roots until you sssqueal!
Well? Have you found anything yet...?
Tools of the Godwoken : Spirit Vision
A mysterious portal to an unknown destination? How whimsical. Onward, then!
His paranoia was so great he saw to it that his tomb was turned into a fortress to thwart the likes of you. I swore to uphold his wishes. But that was before the Voidwoken...
A boy called Han suggested that we could flee in a small boat.
[SEBILLE] *Say he&apos;s in luck. You delight in setting trapped creatures free.*
It seems supporting the Seekers in their fight to take the Lady Vengeance is the path to follow.
The Cursed Ring
Prison
Thank you, I will have to think on this.
Know you? Love you? I&apos;m not even sure we&apos;ve met.
Nothing like a zealot to get the message wrong. Sometimes I think the people who make the most ruckus are the ones who don&apos;t really &lt;i&gt;get it &lt;/i&gt;deep down.
Step off, &apos;less you want a taste.
Hmm. This doesn&apos;t seem to work here.
Ungh... it&apos;s been cursed!
Saw-Toothed Twohander
Bodybuilding determines how resistant you are to physical statuses like Bleeding or Crippled.
*You are Prudence, the innkeeper in Driftwood. You consider yourself humble, but your very being thrums with inflated pride. That pride hides a terrible fear - that you have birthed a monster. Your son Kniles.*
Arena of the One
So... That seemed just a tad... excessive.
Arrow Knockdown
Rhalic, first of the Seven? Not any more!
Dead Peasant
*Reach out and touch her.*
Can&apos;t leash a wolf.
*Say it&apos;s time to end this bastard&apos;s life.*
A cave of bodies, and still not enough Source to complete the ritual...
And Rivellon&apos;s been on its own for too long now...
Like a beggar, you mean? Yeah, and then you&apos;d&apos;ve walked by with a tut-tut. But people like a good story, don&apos;t they.
Well, where is it? Don&apos;t offer me a healing potion if you don&apos;t have one!
End your current combat turn.
Help me! Help me! I&apos;m not trying to escape - I swear! Make her leave, take her away!
Highlights
Farro&apos;s dead... he was right - we should have left this damn city while we had the chance. This is my fault.
&lt;br&gt;[1] turn(s) cooldown
Worn-Out Chest
No entry. Please step back.
*You hear him yelp about the Master, Lone Wolves and a man called Griff.*
*Deny it. You&apos;re not sure you can trust him.*
*Dizziness. It lasts just a moment - but long enough for you to feel Duna&apos;s presence. You hear no words, yet understand: it&apos;s imperative you accept Ryker&apos;s bargain.*
Our eternal thanks, young one. O, timely death...
Hmm, dangers indeed - you can almost hear the sounds of battle when the wind shifts correctly... and where there&apos;s battle, there&apos;s bound to be mercenaries.
Join the Seeker attack.
I tell you what. You seem a loyal dwarf - a true servant of the kingdom. See Dorian dead, and I will meet his offer.
Small Automaton
*Your elven companion saw the memories of a lizard named Zara. You recall she sang to a chest.*
I knew you were guilty! Someone, help!
Maybe. Maybe not. In any case, it hasn&apos;t stopped me from thinking it&apos;d be a good idea to travel together. Whaddya say?
&lt;i&gt;Why? &lt;/i&gt;Why did you trick Lucian by giving him a bomb instead of a portal?
After killing an enemy, your maximum vitality will temporarily increase.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Sigh.*
*As the heat rises, pull your hand away.*
Chest of an Elven Hero
Yoo-hoo! I&apos;m up from my nap! How &apos;bout a hand?
Braccus is gone? You&apos;re telling me that my Braccus... my &lt;i&gt;betrothed&lt;/i&gt; is NO MORE?!
Erasor Grenade
*Wonder about the &apos;she&apos;, that it referred to - who does it speak of?*
Time to open the eyes you lost so long ago... to see the world... as you once did...
You&apos;re only left out in the night, because you only hunt in the night - with the Master&apos;s voice in your ears urging you on.
*Warn the spirit that you know ways to harm it - alive or dead.*
Lucky
*The spirit&apos;s diatribe is cut short by a gasp of horror, then he is no more.*
*Tell him he&apos;s been seriously hurt. At this moment, he has no choice but to trust you.*
&apos;course I do. Seems Voidwoken dog your heels like a shadow. That&apos;s no way to live, is it?
He ate to &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; me, to free this spirit from its earthly ties. With each peck, I grew closer to the Hall of Echoes.
This is not a matter for discussion.
Of course, and glad to. My words shall lift your spirits, make no mistake. But I need to pay my way, so I&apos;d ask for a little gold, if you have it to spare. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Lohse couldn&apos;t bring herself to snuff out all those souls. The demon remains strong, but her conscience is clear.
Uncanny Reflexes
Here, you&apos;re more animal than me, &lt;i&gt;mbaaa&lt;/i&gt;. Sourcerers are baaaaaaaad news and the Magisters know it.
Alright then. The Seekers trust you, and I shall too. I offer my hand in friendship...
Potion of Vitality
Move Character Backward
I can&apos;t believe we&apos;re wasting time contemplating this mere maggot&apos;s death.
Gareth is... he&apos;s still not back. He could be hurt, or... or worse...
Demons lie. You say you are no demon. This is a lie. You are a demon.
Alright, everyone into the boat!
*The creature murmurs a series of unfamiliar noises that amount to absolutely nothing.*
*A chattering shiver passes through the skeleton&apos;s body from toe to head, then back again.*
*Say that you have learned how to drain Source from creatures.*
*Lay a hand upon your weapon and warn her that no-one questions your service to the God King.*
You haven&apos;t met them? No no, that won&apos;t do.
You&apos;re the one who crafted this unholy contraption.
Begging for mercy, Lovrik claimed to have a daughter to support.
Hmm? What purpose did that serve? Was that a greeting? Was it-
This kitchen creates enough hot air as it is - leave. Now.
*Ask him what awaits you beyond the Path of Blood, in Lucian&apos;s tomb.*
Then let the world prepare for its end.
I know... I can &lt;b&gt;SNIFF&lt;/b&gt; good and bad. Ryker bad.
*Suspicious, ask what happens when you open the chest.*
Sleeping_4
*Say you&apos;ve seen the Shriekers yourself. Truly horrifying.*
*She gives you a dark look. Turns away.*
[BEAST] *Promise Lohar you will go to Arx and deal with this bomb. Operation Downfall &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;end.*
Then I was right to sequester myself here with my puppets - trusting &lt;i&gt;people &lt;/i&gt;is a folly.
*Kneel and offer up a hand to show the dog you mean no harm.*
Call me what you like. I&apos;m not afraid of being the villain to your supposed &apos;hero&apos;. I&apos;m not nice. I&apos;m just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
You will show respect! He was a rebel and a hypocrite, but he was still a child of Duna. You best remember as much.
Paladin Archer
One-Handed Axe
You there! Willowy limb-beast! You&apos;re trespassing in the Princess&apos;s Royal Court!
*Take her by the hips and pull her towards you.*
Find Dallis.
Buy Back
*You are an elven spirit. Who you were in life is now forgotten. You have spent the years resisting the pull of the ancestor tree - it would steal your Source. This Source you would gladly give to the Mother Tree...*
*A few sharp tugs and you&apos;ve pulled a severed human hand loose, partially-pecked. You don&apos;t need to be a genius to surmise that the owl choked on his dinner...*
&lt;i&gt;Hssssssss!&lt;/i&gt;
It&apos;s okay - you tried. You did everything you could.
Oh no you don&apos;t, Sourcerer!
Pag Umn
Fish&apos;ll bite alright, but they&apos;re barely fit to feed a dwarf. I&apos;ve a worse problem than that. Way, way worse. I&apos;ve gone and dropped me wedding ring in the water.
It no longer matters who I am. All that matters is that I am free, and I am grateful. Now answer me: Do you wish for me to help you?
I don&apos;t care if the Seven themselves floated down to Rivellon and presented you a gold-threaded invitation - &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am the authority here. And &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have overstepped your bounds.
Blessed Frozen Blood
You have wriggled your way to oblivion.
Bear Form
W-w-well, you&apos;ll find him in Effie&apos;s Emporium, &apos;neath the Black Bull. He&apos;s a f-fine man. A little gruff, yeah, but he&apos;s the only one in Driftwood wantin&apos; to h-help and not hurt.
Zoom In
Driftwood teetered on the edge of starvation, until the night the Voidwoken came from the sea.
City Guard Archer
*She leads you to a door - your study - and pushes it open to introduce your visitor. You step through the door and see the Lady Amadia, one of the Seven lords.*
To the Island
&lt;i&gt;Slave.&lt;/i&gt;
*Let him leave.*
But come now; enough of Dallis and dead cats. You&apos;ve taken this ship and granted my freedom - this is a happy moment!
We were attacked by the Magisters’ captors.
Grandlord Vaxid
Sadha. The promise of dragons. I think that perhaps I value them more highly now even than divinity.
in combat
F
Still can&apos;t get over it. Such a cunning plan. The ships were drawn to the flame like moths.
&apos;North - Harbour&lt;br&gt;South - Arx&apos;
*Drop your jaw. Dallis and Lucian resurrected &lt;i&gt;this wretch?*&lt;/i&gt;
*He swallows hard, then blurts the question:*
However, my requirements are very simple. You go the Blackpits, to a cavern there. In it, you&apos;ll find a stone tablet of considerable value.
Dying to hear them, purebreed.
Aye aye, buck thyself up Jimmy lad! We art blessed with a &lt;i&gt;visitor!&lt;/i&gt;
Karon
Polymorph skills allow you to reshape your body as well as the bodies of your enemies.
The Divine held his ground, if barely.
Oh, he &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be. Old Brother-No-Life took it on himself to stow me down here like a jar of summer peaches he was saving for next winter&apos;s pie. YOU GOTTA WONDER WHAT FOR, EH?
Repairing object failed
Inner Demon Skillbook
The Mother Tree asked Sebille to take root and become the new Mother - the heart of elvendom, the hope of the elves. Sebille refused.
Ryker&apos;s Rest - Cellar
*Boast that you can make others hear the voice you want them to hear. You are &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;powerful.*
Gareth says the Godwoken are being hunted. We should be careful.
*Low voices nearby, low and urgent. Your tormentors seek your Source. They have cut you open, hunting for your power - for your &lt;i&gt;nature.&lt;/i&gt; They have found nothing. Nothing but your death. You welcome it.*
Time will tell.
