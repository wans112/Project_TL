*Sing an old song you&apos;ve heard - about forests and fairies. Perhaps it will acknowledge you.*
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;*GASP!*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
As the races united behind Lucian,
Armour
What once was beautiful is now profane. And a field of death is strewn about my feet. No life can flourish here. No life...
*Enquire as to what Godwoken must do from here.*
*The lizard lets out a low, rumbling growl and turns away from you.*
...she breathes no more. I can feel it.
Let&apos;s give &apos;em hell.
*A slight grin crosses the spirit&apos;s face. Whether her smile is sincere or not, you can&apos;t be sure.*
We&apos;ve had a Voidwoken attack in the middle of a wedding. You don&apos;t want to be here. And I don&apos;t want you here. So bugger off.
*Ask how Dallis was sabotaging him.*
*The Magister groans in pain as you walk away.*
Armour of Frost
SAVAGE! BABY-EATER! SHOO! &lt;i&gt;BACAW!&lt;/i&gt;
We&apos;ll investigate the strange decay in the area.
The Master. A lizard, but not any lizard: a spectre in the flesh. A man with no name. A darker shade in shadows.
*Raise your own weapon. Whoever this figure is, they&apos;re going to regret challenging you.*
I do not fall for such pathetic tricks. You&apos;re coming with me!
Wine Barrel
We have to be.
An Unusual Painting
You don&apos;t remember? Goodness. One moment, my flesh was flaming with cursed fire. The next, you had eased my pain!
Summon a fire slug. Your fire slug can create fire surfaces and launch linear fire attacks.
Rotten Leg
I can&apos;t tell you how thoroughly you&apos;ve made my day. Good luck!
More than enough. Far more... I will suffer him to live no longer.
Fire Slug
*He glances up. In quick succession, he becomes aware of both your presence and the fact that you&apos;re not a familiar face.*
*The ghostly flames flicker out as the spirit vanishes.*
*He looks at you with his brow knitted, lips pursed, pain painted, mask-like, upon his face.*
Look. *Ahem.* Look. I have a job here. I need to guard this cart, and... and more than that I... need to protect people. You and the people out there. I... I can&apos;t let you leave.
*Confirm its suspicion. You&apos;ve had the displeasure.*
*His eyes flash a scalding green. They bore into yours; you cannot look away.*
Revert To Original Form
*Warm red wine flows down your throat. The languor of a tavern evening soothes you. Suddenly, shrieks rent the night; &lt;i&gt;the Magisters have come&lt;/i&gt;. Warm red blood flows down your face...*
*The spirit of a guard gazes around the garden sternly. Clearly he&apos;s unaware of his demise.*
What side do you take?
*Say you want to see what other options there are first.*
Rightly rightly rightly right! How very rightly right! Come inside...
Door to the Courtyard
Carapace
Driftwood owes you a debt - who knows what the Sourcerer may have done had you not intervened. You have my thanks.
Once I&apos;m sure the way&apos;s clear, I&apos;ll run for Arx.
Magister Sang
You should be more careful who you cross!
Reset FreeCamera Speed to default
If you hadn&apos;t come when you did, I might be like that thing. Thank my lucky antler you came when you did!
*Chuckle. Tell her to fire away.*
It is so good of you to come. I&apos;m so proud of what you have accomplished, of the hero you are becoming. You will be at the Well soon, but first I must ask you for help...
A shrine to the God King. Linder Kemm&apos;s holy refuge. And, it seems, my tomb.
[UNDEAD] *Another undead. The word &apos;lich&apos; enters your mind, along with snippets of a chant that forces it to reveal its name...*
You&apos;ll need all the nourishment you can get, if you&apos;re going to make it to the Well of Ascension.
A Scion is precious - a seed containing all the memories of the Ancestor Trees, in case they are lost.
*He sleeps deeply, his breathing soft and regular, the hint of a smile playing about his lips, a musky smell playing about the sheets.*
I&apos;ve heard that before. Keep walking.
...I did. I stuck them like hogs. Oh sweet Duna...
Magical Light Breeches
Take heed- I anticipate snares and perils aplenty.
*Lunge forward to attack anyway.*
Source Titan
Ya ever ache so much that even yer &lt;i&gt;hair&lt;/i&gt; hurts? Cuz let me tell ya, elf, I&apos;m pretty sure even me toe-fuzz is burnin&apos;.
*She shakes her head; her colour returns to normal.*
Rise, root and branch. Obey your Scion - defeat my enemy!
*Say you feel anything but protected here.*
*Wonder if someone else might be pulling her strings.*
A lesson is in order, I think. An emergency lesson. If you wish, I can do what I can to bolster your... &lt;i&gt;limp &lt;/i&gt;charms.
*Note that this seems quite the security contingent for a simple wedding.*
I suppose we should have expected nothing less. Very well, thank you for your efforts. Fruitless as they were...
Hmm... all seems well here...
There you are! I see you managed to stay alive in my absence. There&apos;s hope for you yet. Now let&apos;s find the others.
*Bite down.*
With Lucian gone, the elves reluctantly joined the Divine Alliance.
*Tell it you do not kill the innocent.*
Hell upon hell...
*Leave her to her worries.*
It won&apos;t be no walk in the park, that&apos;s for sure, but it&apos;s the hand we&apos;ve been dealt. It&apos;s on us to find Godwoken like Verdas.
*Say she gave them a good wallop herself.*
You had better not be leading us into danger.
At least they&apos;ll have a &lt;i&gt;choice&lt;/i&gt;. That&apos;s more than most people have right now.
Traitor. Turncoat. &lt;i&gt;Tattletale.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask if that coffin he&apos;s building is for the man he just murdered.*
You have my apologies, dwarf.
Haughty and stern, the young dwarven woman glaring at you from this portrait looks intelligent, if malevolent.
*Say that Arhu likely didn&apos;t want to be disturbed by pilgrims and nobodies - but &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;have important matters to discuss with him.*
*Ifan snorts with laughter, his eyes twinkling with amusement.*
You are a famed warrior, sire. Alas, the honourable Brahmos is not. He sensed them closing in and had no choice but to flee from Driftwood.
It has a certain... beauty.
A Voidwoken turned out to be my assistant Harina! She begged me to free the Eternals from the God King and bring them back to the world.
Weakened Hull Section
Glad &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; made it here in one piece. Any idea what you&apos;re gonna do next?
I... I... Mother, I have no words for that.
Jahan
*A flat circle of polished black obsidian, the mirror is pretty - but now it&apos;s a mirror and nothing more.*
*Pause for a moment. You don&apos;t want to let her down just yet.*
*The Magister&apos;s jaw is tightly clenched as he stares out the window. He senses you.*
Tutorial Log
Let me relieve you of your burden, Marcus.
Most esteemed Sanguinia:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next week my loan is due, but I will not have the money in time, though fierce hard I tried to get it, believe me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please, please extend my deadline by just one more week. I know what happens to those who shirk their debts to you, and I have no wish to join their number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lovrik
Oh dear. You assume something as fleeting as your appearance is enough to impress me. I&apos;m afraid that I can&apos;t honour such idle bragging with my... favours.
*You kiss her on the cheek and she laughs, full of life.*
*Shake your head. You don&apos;t want to talk now.*
*She moves in time to your song, grinning widely.*
I agree. You and she have long been on the road; I suppose you trust one another. The God King must burn, so under your joint command let our child be the all-consuming fire!&lt;br&gt;
What arrogance. But I shouldn&apos;t be surprised. The hubris of your people is why we&apos;re in this mess in the first place. Pray a Divine ascends, or you&apos;ll have been the end of us.
That voice again. Why does it keep speaking to me...?
*She looks up at you in surprise. Her great greenish-gold eyes sparkle, and she rubs a palm over her smooth head, seemingly confused.*
You can invite friends by selecting an empty square. You can kick a player using the button below his player icon.
I&apos;m afraid I truly can&apos;t remember anything. Now unless there&apos;s something else you want, I need to get back to my work...
*Gareth holds his hands up to his face. Dirt clings to the underside of his nails. Grooves on his palms remain from his agitated digging. The self-inflicted wound on his finger is encrusted with blood.*
*As you turn to go, he clears his throat and starts to sing, directing his words toward you with a flourish.*
Attention turned to Tiriara. Perhaps she would bolster Alexandar&apos;s position.
I&apos;ve had no luck so far in locating this fabled vault, but if you do, I swear the entire hoard is yours, no questions asked...
Lucian didn&apos;t make you into a mercenary. But nor did Lucian make you refuse to kill that elf in Fort Joy. Oh yes, I know about that. You&apos;re a paradox, Ifan. And who&apos;s responsible?
What&apos;s it now, eh? Leya&apos;s already on edge without Gareth, and now you&apos;ve gone and upset her double.
Please, can you - *Gasps.* An elf! Stay away, cannibal! If I find out you&apos;ve gone near my baby, I&apos;ll skin you alive!
*Ask her about this place of safety.*
My baby... my little boy...
Peeper! Peeper! Where are you, Peeper!
Oh... &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; one&apos;s not for eating. By you, anyway.
Of Warriors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*In this long chronicle of the history of people killing each other, the historian Huwbert lists every possible form of unmagical combat, including even the memorable occasion on which Vladys Campanell tried to beat her husband to death with the mismatched wooden legs of his most recent mistress.*
Sawtooth Knife
Some Magisters are helping Sourcerers escape. Who are these dissidents?
Werewolf Die
I do hope you come around before it&apos;s too late.
Anyhoo. Well done, you. You&apos;ll make a great disciple, I&apos;m sure.
My friend, I consider it my scholarly duty to know what I can of all that lives and... unlives. Surely you of all people understand the quest for knowledge.
*A ball gripped in her mouth, the dog happily wags her tail.*
Ohhhhhhh... I&apos;m a lucky man, I am.
Character&apos;s health can&apos;t drop below 1.
Let&apos;s see if you can do better this time. Tell me, &lt;i&gt;Sally Smartypants&lt;/i&gt;: is there such thing as free will?
He was my advocate. He worked for me. He wasn&apos;t respectful. He bandied my name around the forest as if it were his own. So I treated him for his insolence. The treatment worked.
Empty Honey Jar
Elemental Havoc (Water)
*Say it&apos;s no different from the other races of the realm. Humans, dwarves, lizards... everyone seems to prefer the company of their own.*
I&apos;m thinkin&apos; yer buddies are busy. But I got good news: I ain&apos;t goin&apos; anywhere! Come back when yer good &apos;n&apos; ready.
Sanctum
Silver-tongued
*He falls to all fours, in increasing pain. And then, at length, he dies.*
*The book is lined with beautiful calligraphy in an unfamiliar language.*
*Assume the worst: She succumbed to the Voidwoken.*
Scattered all over Rivellon, we are! Little Deidara with the Seekers near  Fort Joy, Demira in Driftwood, and Dagmare sailing the seas!
The Red Prince spoke to Stingtail the lizard dreamer. Now it&apos;s my turn.
Grave Marker
This may do some damage before it breaks forever.
*There is but one thing you finally need to know. Why you?*
Bronze Scale Armour
*The slug creature is too wrapped up in its misery and weeping to even notice you.*
*Something inside you strains. You are replete; you cannot absorb more Source.*
That&apos;s a new one!
Plenty more where that came from. Now shut your mouth, prisoner.
That is &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;for you to know.
