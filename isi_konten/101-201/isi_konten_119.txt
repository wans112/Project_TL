Here, mister! Alexandar doesn&apos;t have to stay dead, does - HEY! Are you a &lt;i&gt;lizard?&lt;/i&gt;
*You don&apos;t see why not. Tell her to go ahead and have that chat.*
I don&apos;t want to talk. I just want Fulton back. *Sob.*
Jolly good.
You please me, Godwoken. Now see it done, and your rewards will be many.
Pipe down, will you?
Hmm. Well, never you mind. &lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; sonnet I compose is a masterpiece, and my muse has been begging me to write something new.
He&apos;s not exactly everyone&apos;s &lt;i&gt;favourite &lt;/i&gt;dwarf.
The prisoner will be silent.
*Say you will truly make love to her, for truly you love her.*
The Magisters got him. They left precious little of him behind.
I&apos;m Han. So, Lohse. You helped me out just there, so let me return the favour. You want to get out of here?
*Gently ask what she means. Tainted stew?*
[UNDEAD] *Note that over time he has become frail, while &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;seem to be getting &lt;i&gt;stronger...*&lt;/i&gt;
Access the archives.
[SEBILLE] *Yes. And you&apos;re delighted she thinks you&apos;re ugly.*
House?
I never thought I would be travelling with one of your kind. Much less respecting them.
I wonder if there&apos;s a prize for doing the prayer the most.
*At that moment, the ship serendipitously creaks beneath you, almost like it is acknowledging your observation...*
Tell me: What is your strategy in battle? You do not fight like the others I have seen.
Gratiana&apos;s Soul Jar
Darling... why I can&apos;t remember the last time someone&apos;s shown me such kindness... maybe even never! When it matters most, I will stand alongside you, I promise...
Wind Field 01
The Magisters are closing in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have blocked the gates and are searching, house by house and room by room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But tonight I&apos;ll make a break for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ll not be sent to Fort Joy, I&apos;ll swim for freedom and I&apos;ll have it or the sea will take me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ll find my way home or I&apos;ll find my way to the Hall of Echoes, and Alexandar can visit his cures upon some other lucky fellow.
*Realising in a moment that life - and death - has brought them to the edge of oblivion, they reach for each other - *
*He grins, bashful, and turns back to studiously dancing the coin between his fingers.*
Good t&apos;have you home, Fran. And don&apos;t go runnin&apos; off on me again!
Hmm, how to explain it. You see, with this wand, I can leech the Source from within you. You&apos;ll no longer attract Voidwoken. Rivellon need no longer fear you.
Any who deal a lot of damage to Vitality are bound with Shackles of Pain.
*Shake your head. You don&apos;t have time to worry about an acorn right now.*
Go.
*Tell her you&apos;re on it: You met Jahan and are in the process of securing his help.*
&lt;i&gt;...it&apos;s time to meet an... old friend... come, my prince...&lt;/i&gt;
Do not stay silent. You have questions, we can feel them. Ask.
*Thank him. Tell him you won&apos;t soon forget him.*
We mourn our own around here. The work will wait.
Tell her we wait. Tell her she is our last hope to leave this place.
A rather strange song is transcribed in this book, but the words of magic crawl into your head and give you new insight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the isle of the dead&lt;br&gt;Before they rise&lt;br&gt;You will hear no farewells&lt;br&gt;No goodbyes&lt;br&gt;For it is only a matter of time&lt;br&gt;Before they&apos;re summoned &lt;br&gt;Back to life&lt;br&gt;By the magical powers of the seas&lt;br&gt;And the very essence of to be&lt;br&gt;To be &lt;br&gt;To be&lt;br&gt;To be
The Devourer&apos;s strength courses through this armour, boosting its level to 20. The wearer may channel a violent frenzy that feeds off the life force of enemies.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
It&apos;s a shame that the girl didn&apos;t live... a damn shame. But at least I&apos;ve found out what happened to her.
Soon as I saw that glint in your eye, I knew we&apos;d make a solid team.
What do you mean, Quercus? Of course I&apos;m prepared. I have my noble steed below me and my trusted Shield beside me. What more could I need?
I wish I could be working that fancy wedding I keep hearing about - I&apos;d earn more gold over there than serving up slop to priests here...
Mutilated Corpse
*Ask if all demons have a personal realm like this.*
I like your confidence. Very well, consider yourself invited.
He&apos;ll say my name before he dies, I swear it. &lt;i&gt;He&apos;ll say my name.&lt;/i&gt;
*Announce that the cook in the tavern is responsible for the Magisters gone missing.*
A common ingredient in cosmetics, the enchanting gleam of this dust highlights even the plainest features with the lustre of the stars.
But I will be with you. I will guide you; stand by you. I will watch as you drink from the Wellspring, and as its Source surges into you.
Ingredients Cupboard
We never dealt with Queen Justinia.
Paladin Vishlar
I need something... for the pain...
*The faintest trace of Deathfog drifts from the horn of the trumpet.*
These are Arhu&apos;s chambers? Did he send you?
*Refuse. You will not harm those who won their victory alongside you.*
I might ask you the same. This place is mine, after all, and Arhu was my prisoner.
&lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; wedding party...
Here&apos;s a valuable bit advice: If ever I&apos;m worried, you should be &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;worried.
The arch-demon&apos;s name is Adramahlihk. Jahan will want to know.
Deflection Aura
Margret&apos;s Secrets
*The moment you finger the silky flower, icy darkness pierces your heart. The chill freezes your bones, then rushes free, leaving a single word etched within you: &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.*&lt;/i&gt;
I don&apos;t know about that. I know we were meant to represent Lohar, and I know there was said to be an &lt;i&gt;interesting &lt;/i&gt;guest or two present... you among them.
SP
*Hold up your writ of passage. You&apos;ve got permission from the Order to enter.*
If Mistress Almira would have her thralls report to camp there yonder, we would make use of them.
*Ask Ifan what he thinks you should do now.*
Lake 02
Kin. The consulate&apos;s fires still rage. Is there no-one that can quench them?&lt;br&gt;
Soon the Seven will be nothing but morsels in the maws of the Void.
Magical Wooden Targe
&apos;Right.&apos; An interesting concept.
Trayde the Merchant
I truly enjoyed watching you fight, Godwoken. But it is nothing compared to the pleasure I shall take in watching you die.
Sable
I was hoping to talk to you about your research. Do you truly think this &apos;veil&apos; is the key to unlocking a new future?
Well I think you&apos;re a big, dumb tree-guy with leaves coming out of your nose and dead grass where your brain should be! And you EAT PEOPLE! So THERE!
*A young man works at a canvas mounted on an easel. Smears of what must be red paint are evident on his hands and clothing. He&apos;s oblivious; in a daze as he paints.*
*They lick their lips, the gem forgotten. For now.*
So what&apos;s your first order of business? End world hunger? Instigate world peace? Send all spiders back to hell, where they belong?
Wellllll...
Dallis is an imposter! An Eternal, she murdered the real Dallis, stole her name and face, and rose through the ranks of the Divine Order.
After consuming the flesh of the victim, we learned that he was attacked by an old woman.
Son Against Father
A bit like yourself.
They&apos;re all the same, you know. Tyrants. Liars. &lt;i&gt;Carrion birds&lt;/i&gt;. The best thing would be for them all to destroy each other, and leave the rest of us to live in peace.
[BEAST] *Tell her you&apos;ve seen your share of troubles, but they made you the person you are. You couldn&apos;t ask for more or less.*
Donna&apos;s Soup Recipe
No. They kill &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt; when they steal my spores. I warn them they are volatile.
Mixed a little... ungh... fish into some of my stew. Bloody mackerel must&apos;ve been... tainted.
Puppeteer
&lt;i&gt;You can&apos;t!&lt;/i&gt;
Autumn Wine
How many innocent lives will die before you see reason? &lt;i&gt;Kill her.&lt;/i&gt;
And don&apos;t you mistake my compliment for it either. Mossmuncher.
Oh, anywhere you like! Just plant the seedling in the bucket, then place it in the ground. Herbs have their own wisdom, they can take it from there...
This isn&apos;t fair. Why do I even play with you?
Magister Training Sword
*Malady lies lifeless on the ground, her face knotted into that of a demon&apos;s. She sacrificed her soul for us, and now it&apos;s truly gone.*
*She&apos;s right - you don&apos;t like the way your God has been acting. Denounce Tir-Cendelius.*
This is no old tale for me... I&apos;ve been suffering because of Braccus Rex for longer than I can count... and all because I helped him find the power that he craved...
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me ALONE!
You don&apos;t say. How very interesting. One can&apos;t but wonder what memories haunt the hollows of your windswept head...
We defeated the Great Guardian.
Mouse Scroll Down
Hah! Where&apos;s your Source collar, dog? Though you are a very tall, very... uh... beautiful dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
Squee! Squee! Squeeeeeeee!
*Squints.* Who are you?
*Say you&apos;re not so sure. You could have done with almighty power.*
*Turn your back. Rhalic called you to an Order you want no more part of.*
*Look at him incredulously.  The Gods are forces of nature, they don&apos;t have a history.*
Oh my sweet, it is naught but a chill. Your soul has a draught, it seems. Perhaps you should-
Like all lizards, I give great credence to dreams, for I know them to flow not from the sleep-hazed mind, but from another plane of existence altogether.
As per your own testimony, you have the taste buds of a dung beetle, the fashion sense of a monkey in a clown suit, and your personal hygiene reminds one of a carcass rotting in the sun.
*Tell him that he might be young, but you can see that he&apos;s a born leader. He can do this.*
*You&apos;re tired of the mind games. Lunge at the White Magister and show him what a Godwoken can do.*
I bought your silence. I don&apos;t want to have to buy it again... &lt;i&gt;permanently.&lt;/i&gt;
Hmmm, you seem to be in the company of your fair share of followers already. And I don&apos;t like the look of them. Get rid of one and I&apos;ll join you.
Bloated Corpse explodes, dealing [1] to all characters around it. Death-resisting effects cannot protect Bloated Corpse from destruction by this skill.
It didn&apos;t have to be this way. You could have shown me mercy. And you refused.
I landed on Reaper&apos;s Coast. There are Lone Wolves in the region - they may have information on the Master.
*Take her hand and examine it closely.*
*The lovers stare into each other&apos;s eyes, together at last. Taryan registers your presence for the first time...*
That kind o&apos; talk &apos;ll land ya on the rack, pipsqueak! Play tough &apos;n&apos; we&apos;ll play rough, ya hear?
You look like you can handle yourself. I bet you have some stories to tell, and not all of them inside the Magisters&apos; idea of the law?
If you can walk, get yourself up the ladder! There&apos;s a b... - Wait! Voidwoken!
Pickaxe
I infused my god&apos;s Source into my soul. I must find powerful Sourcerers who can help me grow. Then can I claim Divinity at the Well of Ascension.
*Ask her what&apos;s going on. Where &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;you?*
This is no time to feign ignorance, my friend. The doctor&apos;s arrogance may end us all. He has released a dark presence upon us.&lt;i&gt; It must never sing the Taming;&lt;/i&gt; the hymnals must be destroyed!
*The Magister narrows his eyes, searching for any sign of treachery in your face.*
May they serve you well. You have them with my gratitude.
Cursed Fire Cloud
*The tears flow faster and faster.*
