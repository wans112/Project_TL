The power gifted to me - the power of Mord&apos;Akaim. The power to bend the feeble-minded to my will. And so much more.
*The gem sits heavily in your pouch.*
Servants. Slaves. Labourers. Food. They - *cough* they shall serve many purposes.
Invalid Target!
Well met, friend! Interested in Driftwood&apos;s finest catch?
*Awkward. You&apos;ve just realised you don&apos;t have any memorable tales of Voidwoken fights to share.*
*Say this isn&apos;t any of your business.*
Metal Shield
Empty hand
You&apos;d have to eat &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; first.
Gotta run. See you around.
There&apos;s a local thug, Lohar. He runs an operation out of his hideout beneath the Black Bull tavern. I suspect this man of being a spy for his queen.
Be torn if you must. I&apos;ll soon stitch you back together.
Bone Scale Boots
I don&apos;t think so. Trolls don&apos;t like grownups.
*Tell her that that is for fate to decide.*
Back again eh? You poor, beautiful beast - you must be in awe.
Leave me to my little dreams, won&apos;t you. Perhaps this time I&apos;ll show up to academy without my robe again...
Bless you, Sebille. I bow before the Mother.
You&apos;ll find we have some interesting &lt;i&gt;specials &lt;/i&gt;today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But where&apos;s Roost&apos;s concerned? Might want to dial back some of those lofty expectations you&apos;re lugging around. He&apos;s... not friendly to outsiders.
Meow!
*He bids the Dreamer stand up and pay attention, which he does in a grovelling and awkward manner.*
How right you are. But you face more than &apos;some mad witch.&apos;
*Say you don&apos;t really understand most of what happens during battle.*
We return him to goodness.
Invite failed! The lobby&apos;s visibility is set to &apos;Nobody.&apos; Change your connectivity settings or use Direct Connect.
We defeated the Magisters, saving the Scion.
*With a curt nod, she turns back to her books.*
Ancient Black Ring Shield
Waking Ryker
Shroud of the Voidwoken
I accept your offer. Now go on with you, before I change my mind.
Write &apos;Password&apos;.*
*Ask him about his prophetic dreams with Brahmos.*
*Hold up your hand and siphon away a bit of Source. Just a little. Would he like to change his mind now?*
[OUTLAW] *Get inventive and ask if they&apos;re worried about the Seeker army that&apos;s camped nearby.*
Unholy Altar
Replica of a Wolf Statue
My angel returns. I have news: it seems there&apos;s been a change on high in the Order. My case is to be re-evaluated.
Explore the temple.
*He considers your offer.*
Look - Mordus had to go, one way or another. I thought... I thought I could kill two birds with one stone!
You pay for this!
Bedazzler
[LOHSE] *Muse that no-one is ever as they seem.*
You callous... I&apos;ll not let you get away with such insolence!
Gwydian is safe? My Gwydian? I... I am relieved. You are a friend to Sourcerers. If you&apos;d stay a friend, you must help me.
Embodiment of Rhalic
Ha! Oh please, forgive my joculation. Leave? You shall not leave, lady.
Thank you. Bless you. You did what I could not. After such a feat it cannot be denied: you are worthy of divinity.
*The Knight&apos;s spirit is altogether more composed than his late, corporeal form. His helmet rests in the crook of his arm, revealing an august dwarven face, creased with worry.*
*Hesitate. Perhaps you&apos;ll wait.*
They&apos;ll pay for their lies.
Pag Ydra
Escort Mihaly to safety.
*The plaque is covered in hateful graffiti. Beneath the imaginative expletives, you can make out that this used to be a site of offering to the Seven.*
Warms your hands on that, stranger, if you want.
Down the hatch!
*The elven leader gives you an angry look, then turns away.*
*Scoff and say he owes you a bit more than gratitude!*
Mystical Medium Rock Rune
Almost wish I&apos;d gone straight to the Void. They were... feeding. Eating me. If one of &apos;em hadn&apos;t gone for my throat I could have woken up to that. Feeling every bite...
Oh go on! Please! You may be scaly but you don&apos;t have to be weird as well!
These cards are marked! Ha! But you guessed that already, dintcha? Alright then, what am I holding?
I don&apos;t know why the two of you are still goin&apos; on about this. That bomb&apos;s got to be on its way to Arx. Get movin&apos;!
*The more furious you are, the more stoic Ryker becomes.*
*He gives you an appraising look, almost &lt;i&gt;admiring.*&lt;/i&gt;
Throw dust at all enemies in range, blinding them and dealing [1].
Magic Trader
Well, in that case I might just... just...
We freed Slane, the Dragon Knight. He destroyed the Shriekers barring our way.
Still! My job ain&apos;t to judge, but to heal. Or if that fails, to comfort. Seems that&apos;s all I can do for ol&apos; Dain anymore.
*Once more you feel your soul expand with raw Source. Deep inside, your god calls for you again.*
Hey. Want some goooooold? &lt;i&gt;Sssssssset ussssssss free.&lt;/i&gt;
Lohar&apos;s Wedding Invitation
Ah, finally, you&apos;re right about something.
Gentleman Thief
*Tell it that loving someone against their will is a form of hatred.*
UI Request trade dialog
You&apos;ll see.
As a priest, I had a patient. A dastardly demon held him in its grasp. The demon absorbed all his pain... in exchange for his soul. I was certain we&apos;d only diminish the demon by overwhelming my patient with pain.
[BEAST] *Shrug. You did the job in front of you, that&apos;s all.*
‘On Blackpeak Isle’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Cranley Huwbert&apos;s volume on the northern territory of Blackpeak Isle makes a visit there seem more terrifying than tantalising. The pervasive scent of sulfur - and rumours of hulking creatures roaming the hills - seem hardly inviting to any civilised mortal. According to Huwbert, dwarves have established an outpost there, but the tome is thin on details, and is clearly a work in progress.*
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her you&apos;re still in awe of Kniles&apos; work with a scalpel. He taught you so much!*
My daughter is right - our people have caused too much pain. I have sealed the Veil against them. I am Eternal no more. This now is home.
[IFAN] *This isn&apos;t the right moment to make yourself known. You keep your head down and your mouth shut.*
Very well. We&apos;re all entitled to our secrets, I suppose. I ought to continue what I&apos;m doing here, unless there was anything else...?
Go, must I. As must you.
The elven mind is as simple as it is stubborn. My answer remains, as ever: no.
*Gareth scans the wreckage and whistles. The Lady Vengeance is well and truly ruined.*
Divinity beckons...
AP Recovery
*Say that&apos;s to be expected. A lot has happened, after all.*

I figured you looked like a criminal. I&apos;m taking you to prison!
Bark At The Rune: On Frames
*The boy&apos;s frown turns to a smile, and he beams like the summer sun. Impossibly, your heart stirs at the sight of a young child confined to a cage.*
*Tell her to mind her own business.*
*You feel the pull of a far-off connection. You feel the dungeon. The red, organic tendrils binding you. Your ears are filled with screams, and you&apos;re surprised to find they are your own.*
We discovered that once the network will be large enough, dryads will sprout from these roots, equipped with the memories, experience and enormous powers of generations of elves: a vast invincible army that will obliterate everything in their path. It will be the end of all other races.
Mass Cleanse Wounds Skillbook
Ye got some spirit for the learnin&apos; sort. Me pride demands callin&apos; yer bluff, so pray to yer gods there&apos;s some truth in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I unearthed knowledge of a great power within those texts... a great and terrible power... one that Braccus coveted above all.
We are on Scion business, kin. Do not interfere.
Don&apos;t leave me... I don&apos;t want to die alone...
Han tells me you helped him out of Fort Joy? For that, you have my thanks.
It&apos;s a dwarf eat dwarf world! And rats like you? They never go hungry...
Rumour has it an exorcism went wrong there long ago, and for a short time a great demon stood unopposed. Had it not been for Doctor Daeva, the entirety of Reaper&apos;s Coast could have looked like Bloodmoon Island looks today.
The princess! Where is she? Out with it, man!
The Mother is sick. She is weak. Her grip slips at last. You make her so. You kill her Scions. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are strong now, Sebille. You are Prime Scion. You are Godwoken.
&lt;i&gt;Safe&lt;/i&gt;
Jeweller&apos;s Delight
I hope Lord Kemm doesn&apos;t expect us to keep doing this.
And of course a cook who can&apos;t taste is about as useful as a dog in a chess game.
Mmmm &lt;i&gt;mmm!&lt;/i&gt; I could watch &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; walk by all day every day, sugar.
I just want to get out of here before any more of these things show up.
*Apologise and say you don&apos;t speak the ancient tongue.*
*...and Thom can&apos;t stop the blood, and through the panic and the tears he puts his own price on the Lone Wolf&apos;s head. You just lie there thinking; she&apos;s stronger than you knew, and faster too.*
*The White Magister&apos;s chest heaves with fury.*
What do you think you&apos;re doing?
Babies gone, stolen eggs, stolen and gone!
You kiddin&apos;? I don&apos;t eat what I sell. I usually buy from Ovis over there.
*Say that you&apos;re no-one. Just a traveller passing through.*
An eye for an eye is all well and good; thousands of eyes for an eye is somewhat of an exaggeration.
*Laugh loudly. This isn&apos;t love. This is the opposite of love.*
Off
Mm-hm, it is. If Mom were here I could play it outside in the sun. She&apos;d tell all those mean humans outside to leave us alone!
Take out Lohar.
I did only what I was meant to do. I don&apos;t deserve thanks. I gave only the bare minimum - and still, I strayed quite far.
*Tell her you did. You&apos;ve escaped from Fort Joy and are looking for a way off the island.*
I will ask much of you in time, but for now you have a simple goal: Escape the watch of those who would hinder you. Be free of those who would ensare you.
You have returned here too early, Sebille. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
*The fish instantly churns your insides... you double over in pain.*
As you don this helm, the world is blanketed in silence. You feel your mind clear as your senses awaken, sharper than any blade.
You are fortunate, Your Majesty, to have found this place. Fortunate to have found &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
backstabbed
*Ignore his invitation. Ask how he knows you&apos;re a Godwoken.*
The liaison with our lizard lover was a set-up. Dwarven thugs stole our stuff. If we want it back we&apos;ll have to find it first.
*The lizard grins wide, unable to contain his excitement.*
The Void closes in, then. It&apos;s so much more dangerous than even Deathfog. Deathfog, we can see and smell. The Void is empty, intangible. We don&apos;t know it&apos;s there until its creatures are upon us.
I was the armour&apos;s perfect artisan, and she the Devourer&apos;s perfect speaker! She believed in me...
Maggot, I am no slave.
*Refuse to help and take your leave.*
Whoever does finally beat Murga... well I&apos;ll owe him or her an ale for sure.
I see so few guests. Such a pity you shan&apos;t appreciate my... hospitality.
