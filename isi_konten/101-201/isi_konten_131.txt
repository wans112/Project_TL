Ah. *Blinks.* So the prisoners escaped? That seems unlikely - since they were well shackled. But perhaps the Magisters are not as guilty as we&apos;d thought. Not that that lets them off the hook, of course.
Ah. You.
I&apos;m not giving you a name - I&apos;m not giving you &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;. Whoever you find there - &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;ever you find - it&apos;s not on me.
Get out of my sight. And if you put so much as a toe out-of-place again, I&apos;ll see you hanged.
*Tell her you want to take a long, long, &lt;i&gt;long &lt;/i&gt;break. After that... who knows.*
Speak with the spirit of Eleanessa.
*Say that you&apos;d rather stick together to the end.*
But it does, darling. It surely does.
*Spits.*
Rusted Ritual Dagger
A blazing statue concealed a secret hatch.
You were truly marvellous out there, my dear. We&apos;d never have made it without you.
Finally someone with a little sense around here.
*The Great War? Ask the sheep whose side he was on.*
Go &apos;way! I&apos;m hiding!
&lt;i&gt;Rav Mudom... Anan erchet... Veytou doran...&lt;/i&gt;
There are more Masters of the Source, more aspects of the Source to learn. The hunt continues...
The gods have gone into hiding within your fellow Godwoken. They seek to become what we are. Stronger together. Unstoppable together. But we are far ahead of them already... and I know where we must go next.
Our Lady&apos;s naught but kindling now. All we&apos;ve got is each other.
You would be wise to leave here. My Princess is already in a foul mood; to have an uninvited guest show such ignorance would only inflame her further!
You speak fiercely. You speak without fear. You are a warrior: a being of power, and ever in need of it.
Move on, please. Move on. Move on.
*Produce Alexandar&apos;s head from your pack. Throw it to the floor before the Sallow Man&apos;s long-toed feet.*
The Seekers are going to rally at an abandoned camp overlooking the shore to prepare for their attack on the Lady Vengeance. We should meet them there as soon as we are ready.
&lt;i&gt;Almost &lt;/i&gt;every single troll I encountered in my life has ONE elemental weakness that puts a halt to their uncanny regenerative abilities. IMAGINE! Fascinating, isn&apos;t it?
Jewellery Box
Gone Marge, gone Marge, gone...
*Ask if there&apos;s any way out of Fort Joy.*
Reclaim what I&apos;ve lost.
Well then, as is our family tradition, so shall I! Here goes...
HYPERDRIVE PROTOCOL
*Tell her that you&apos;re very happy to see she&apos;s turned her life around, and take your leave.*
Lohse challenged me for Divinity. Our alliance is over.
Orifice manipulator already at full deployment!
*It snaps at your hand.*
Alright. But I&apos;ll be keeping my eye on you.
Sometimes death will not be denied. You are not to blame.
*The spider hisses at you and waves you away with one spindly leg. She&apos;s clearly in no mood for company.*
What else would I be doing?
I&apos;m a Lone Wolf. We work better alone. Now, the promise...
Mama... I w-want mammma...
*He nods at the corpse of the lizard beside him and keeps hammering. Thud. Thud. Thud.*
The potential really is quite massive!
*Wryly tell him the force he used against you implies otherwise.*
I... believe you to be of a noble mind. Give me the jar. It is only right.
Dazing Bolt
I- I don&apos;t know what to say. What a strange experience.
*He lifts his visor. Two deep green eyes fix you in their stare. In an instant you know you are speaking to Rhalic, god of all humans.*
*Say you&apos;re just having a look around.*
To be the heart, or to be heartless, is that it? Wouldn&apos;t count your chickens just yet...
The Archers of the Northern Peaks need no introductions. Any lost hunters or curious wanderers who happen upon them are made aware of this fact by a swift arrow through the heart.  Self-sufficient nomads, the Archers have no concern for the affairs of flatlanders and are loathe to descend from the icy mountains they call home. Only once in all history did the tribe deign to join the affairs of the mainland: to fight the ever-encroaching war against the Source King Braccus.  Since Braccus&apos; defeat, the Archers have, once per generation, offered their finest soldier to the Order of the Source Hunters in an effort to rout Source before it ever may rise again. These soldiers are unmatchable in Rivellon for their marksmanship and ability to strike, unseen, like a frigid wind.
*Say you&apos;re dying for a drink first.*
The fluorescent liquid in this medium-sized vial looks more radioactive than potable, but its effect on one&apos;s perception is undeniable.
Combat
You won&apos;t find the leader of the Magisters walking in the open in Arx! Not after what they&apos;ve done. This is Paladin territory now.
Captain Sech Zapor&apos;s Soul Jar
*Blame Lucian.*
Keeping watch. Tending graves.
Source Vampirism Scroll
Hockham&apos;s Razor
No mean feat to give up on the promise of divinity, but you&apos;ve convinced me.
Now let&apos;s move. Not doin&apos; no good thinkin&apos; on all this.
Tough Metal Boots
—the empty vessels that had once carried their formidable souls—
*Note that she sounds a little obsessed.*
I beg you, you must seek it out. The vault contains relics of great power, and if they were to fall into the wrong hands...
Anyway, you&apos;re not here for a lecture. You&apos;re here for &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; delicious little morsel. Use it well and it should help you send Alexandar to his rightful place beside his father in the Hall of Echoes...
There is no hope here. There is success. Failure. Forgiveness. Condemnation. Conviction. Punishment. Nothing succeeds like excess. Do you hope to solve the riddles of Braccus Rex the just?
Hold up! I gotta take care of some business.
Loadgame failed (copy from levelcache failed). Please report this.
The power must have gone to his head. He never wanted anyone to take his place.
Woohoo! Haha!
Sadha, the Red Princess. You&apos;re familiar with her, I presume? She is here in Arx - and the House of Shadows means to find her.
Open Sanders&apos; desk.
Matter of fact, speaking of cleaning up... I&apos;ve some work I could send your way, if you&apos;re interested?

Bruno! Attack!
*Reach into his brain, searching for the location of the key to the mountain.*
Lord Ruaney&apos;s Britches
*Tell him you&apos;ll try again.*
I will open the passage to the dragon&apos;s dream, but the fight is yours to win.
I think it&apos;s waiting. Biding its time. For what, I&apos;m not totally sure. But it&apos;s... eager.
Encrusted with clumps of dirt, this staff wafts the scent of earth and loam.
Not so &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; far from home, I&apos;m sure. This is the turf of Magisters, and Magisters tend to be human, like you.
There might be hope yet.
He&apos;zzz dead, the Burned Eye Man? That&apos;zzz good. He kicked uzzz. I&apos;m hungry.
*You go for a quiet walk. When you return you see Sadha and the Red Prince exiting the wagon, hand in hand.*
Mine&apos;s to be my old master and he&apos;ll suffer like he never imagined.
[SEBILLE] *Shrug and say that it&apos;s easier to see if he has anything worth looting when he&apos;s not aflame...*
*Wait, ask him to hear you out. Tell him everything about the Aeteran and Dallis&apos; plan to drain the Source from Rivellon.*
*He fixes you with a steely gaze, eyes burnished and shining like pebbles of hatred.*
My darling...
Divinity. Surreal is it not? So much more... insubstantial almost, than desiring an empire, or vengeance, or fame.
I won&apos;t be seen talking to a lizard, when war with the Ancient Empire is on the horizon. Good day.
I am. Got enough trouble roaming around these parts. Don&apos;t need any more.
...I can&apos;t say more.
[JESTER] *Cry... just like a whiny little baby.*
Hardly.
Duration
Paladin guards at a cell spoke of the witch imprisoned within.
As soon as he knew we were on to him he ran. We think he&apos;s hiding in here, but he&apos;s a canny one.
In need of aid?
Because you&apos;re the very apex of your species, I assume? You really mustn&apos;t let one little god-meeting go to your head.
The world grew too civilised for us. No plunder. No glory. Nothing to make our hearts quicken.
What now?
Priest
*Say it feels like you&apos;ve been here for years.*
Roost Anlon kills her, and I don&apos;t know why. Roost Anlon kills Scions, and I don&apos;t know why.
*Another step. Ever closer. The moment has finally come. She&apos;s found the Master.*
The time for fear and trepidation is over. The demon is here. We cannot turn back now.
*Say that you too have this and that to sort out. He&apos;s welcome to tag along if he wants.*
We will flay your every last strip of bark until you bow to the Ring!
With Arhu&apos;s blessing, Sanders the Toyseller should help us retrieve the amulet and scroll required to bypass the Path of Blood.
It was more than just intention...
All this trouble over a wrecked caravan...
It has a strange beauty to it. Cruel and terrible, but alluring all the same.
*The spirit tightens his grip on his sword, trying to still the tremors in his hands. He braces himself...*
*For just a moment Source swirls around you and then, with a whisper, it cascades into your body. You feel light as the power of the universe fills your being.*
Alchemy Trader
Yer outta yer gourd, are ya? Thought as much.
Clever will only walk you so far.
Sanctuary
*The shimmering ghost of a kin Magister turns her gaze upon you. She holds your stare, boring into your head, searching the blacks of your eyes for the secrets of your soul... but in so doing she shows you hers.*
A simple cup, slightly rusted and stained with wine.
You don&apos;t strike me as a jester. I like a good joke...
Come on, damn you... &lt;i&gt;think!&lt;/i&gt;
*Sebille&apos;s voice sounds from over your shoulder.*
Black Wolf
Numpad 9
*The dog&apos;s tail starts to wag frantically.*
*As if taken by a sudden notion, she turns and flees in that direction.*
You&apos;re on thin ice, elf. And I&apos;m very close to cracking.
Do not profane this holy shrine with your presence.
This place is nothin&apos; more than a temporary inconvenience, child. Free or jailed, alive or dead, the Divine has left us. We oughta concern ourselves with begging his return, first &apos;n&apos; last.
Regardless, further study will be required. In fact...
*Dash for the red. You&apos;ll find safety there.*
*There is no blackroot, but you do find another knife and ritual bowl behind a pickled voidwoken fetus.*
I am Sadha.
We sailed from Reaper&apos;s Coast without helping Tarquin.
Ain&apos;t up to owt. Jes&apos; lookin&apos; for someone.
*Turn away; this is not a conversation you want to have.*
*Recall what Delorus told you and say there&apos;s no nobler soul in all the realm.*
Mighty Seven, smile upon the fallen.
You get immunity to electricity, but lowered resistance to poison and earth damage. You bleed electrified water.

When held with bare hands, this ancient-looking seed winds thin tendrils around fingers.

White Magister Meeting Notes
I can deduct one recipe from this book, but this reads more like a puzzle than a recipe. I will have to experiment with what I can learn from these rhymes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tormented souls by old scrolls are absorbed&lt;br&gt;Then fed with some food for the creatures unborn&lt;br&gt;Just imagine a sneeze from another dimension&lt;br&gt;With pepper release it, to grab their attention
*Say you aren&apos;t interested.*
*You&apos;re curious what excuse he will come up with: ask about his shrine to the God King.*
