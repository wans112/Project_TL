Shield, we are about to enter the belly of the beast. To cross a threshold past which there may be no hope of return.
*Tell Ifan he did nothing wrong. The responsibility lies with Lucian, whether he was set up or not.*
Ah - there you are. I was afraid you&apos;d had an unpleasant run-in with our shiny new god.
A person who smelled of rot came to Arhu&apos;s private quarters. They threw Charlie&apos;s ball out the window.
Stay wary, lest we meet the same fate.
*Ask what happened - how did they die?*
You! You need to leave!
*In the squalor of these hellish surroundings you spy a lone, bewildered figure.*
I&apos;m sorry we had to rely on an outsider, but I&apos;m grateful for your help.
*You don&apos;t have time for this. Wrap your powers around the spirit, smothering it, engulfing it, forcing it to reveal its secrets.*
I&apos;ve found my ship. I&apos;ve found my crew. &lt;i&gt;You&apos;ve &lt;/i&gt;found my own armour.
How about you just be on your way now, alright? My manners only lasts for so long.
Elven Menaulion
*Growl that Isbeil is the least of her problems. First, she&apos;ll deal with &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Search for information.
I can see it in your face. You know the truth, don&apos;t you?
The Seekers may be dying out, but with our success they will have achieved their goal.
Hmm. How to explain it, Quercus?
*As you near a figure clad in old, blackened armour, Sebille takes your hand and gives it a squeeze.*
*Investigate the runes.*&lt;br&gt;
*Consume the spirit&apos;s precious Source. He will never roam the Hall.*
*...Sallow begins to eat.*
Ebony
*Growl that prison will only augment your strength and spite.*
Worry not, guv&apos;nor! There&apos;s more ways than one to earn a bit of coin down here!
*Ask her about the One.*
Well perhaps you wish to ramble no more? This place is safe for all - you may stay as long as you wish.
You must. The battle for divinity is about to begin in earnest. The other gods and their chosen will try to outflank us just like we must outflank them.
I&apos;m sure we can agree that a few dried-out meatbags is... acceptable sacrifice.
*The light is where this soul belongs. Herd it there.*
You have questions. In here, I have answers.
You betrayed your King. You turned away from him. You ran to the Seven Lords because you were curious. Because you &lt;i&gt;had &lt;/i&gt;to know more about the Veil.
*Cackles*
*Boop his nose.*
You may count it, but it&apos;s all there, I promise you that. You&apos;ve earned every penny and I thank you for it.
Beast...
Money makes blind. I wonder how many of you can still see the light of day...
He panicked when the Magisters came. We all did. They dragged him away... and... my family. My little boy...
*The warrior moves to attack, but stumbles to the ground. He is dead within moments.*
UI Select Char3
Monsterskin Sandals
Very, very, very pleased to meet you.
You want your freedom, don&apos;t you? Then join the mantra of freedom.
*Reach out and tap into his thoughts...*
Physical Armour:
Imagine it. Holding in your hand a force that could wipe away sun and shadow. A sword of life and death, miracle and sin. A sword of... atonement.
*A figure stands before you... none other than &lt;i&gt;Bishop Alexandar himself&lt;/i&gt;...*
Explore the sewers.
I don&apos;t begrudge you your freedom, Sebille, but you came looking for me driven by no more than ordinary bloodlust.
*Say that it&apos;s not ideal, but you didn&apos;t have much of a choice.*
Necessity.
Knock it off. I don&apos;t warn you again.
You thought a murderer could walk here untouched?
School&apos;s Out
A shiny ring made of copper.
Alright. I&apos;ll look past it this one time, then. But don&apos;t let it happen again.
Oh... yes. A family trip. I&apos;m sure you can understand we&apos;re all &lt;i&gt;quite &lt;/i&gt;keen on leaving as soon as possible.
And so it is done. You, the god of light. I, the god of dark. Balance. We should be proud of what we&apos;ve accomplished - and all that&apos;s yet to come.
No! Protect me, Rhalic, as I have protected you all these years... Rhalic! Rhaaa- &lt;i&gt;AAH!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell Jahan the good news: the Advocate is dead. You have it on good authority.*
&apos;Here lies Honest Dorryld.&lt;br&gt;Or whatever his real name was.&lt;br&gt;We are glad to give him rest.&apos;
*Tell him you&apos;ll do what you can.*
Drop it on the ground and watch it grow.
*Insist that you aren&apos;t following it - it approached you!*
Broken Sarcophagus
*Introduce yourself and ask who she is.*
The merciful thing would be to hasten their journey to the Hall of Echoes.
*Ask about the cat-lord. &apos;Ar-hoo-loo.&apos;*
Speak. The word. And I. Shall open.
We cannot help you with such things. We are beyond it. But you have questions, we can feel them. Ask.
*Ask to know more about this Doctor and where his sick room might be.*
*Tell it you require plain answers, not prayers and riddles. Cry out its name: Xhaxh!*
Oh great, a citizen. Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m on a break here?
I... yes. His voice. It makes the air-drops quiver. He waits there, and I will meet him.
Destroy the pillars. Go on. GO ON.
Your loss!
*Remark that she is very perceptive and ask to see her stock.*
This key looks old and rusty. It may have just one use left in it...
*Sigh.* I would have loved for you to have seen our point, my friend. It would have made your transformation all the more rewarding for both of us.
You think I can&apos;t tell a liar from a mile away?
There&apos;s no time. I can&apos;t hold us here.
I&apos;m... I&apos;m healed. Thank you, stranger. You should have seen to the others first though. They&apos;re far closer to the Hall of Echoes than I ever was.
*The world fades and twists and mutates. You&apos;re in the Hall of Echoes now. It reshapes itself around you. Those who stood with you or against you are no longer there... but you know they cannot be far.*
Hail, my red friend. Bringing excellent word?
*Gareth speaks in a clipped rhythm.*
Come on, wake up...
Curiosity doesn&apos;t just kill cats. We could always just... leave it here.
You have failed me. This cannot go unpunished.

*Produce the components of the Swornbreaker and hand them over to Almira.*
We told Stewart that the missing Magisters were killed by the cook. He was disappointed not to have solved the mystery himself.
Holy Grenade
Now... onward!
*Slowly back away from the creature...*
&lt;i&gt;You defile this sacred place. I will obliterate you from both this world and the next.&lt;/i&gt;

*She turns her head to the heavens once more.*
And I&apos;m back where I started. Nowhere to go but up!
*Rhalic visibly bristles at the mention of your companions.*
*He reaches for the wand, but pulls back before touching it.*
*As you leave you can&apos;t help but look at his eyes - desperate and pleading. He squeezes them shut and turns away.*
...ssssssssslick.
*Inform him you cleared the consulate of the Void revenants who were haunting it.*
*Pursing her lips, Captain Orell glares at the carrion birds circling the bloodied remains of her men that litter the entrance to Arx.*
*Say you didn&apos;t intend to, but she got caught up in something else and... it just happened.*
*She sighs and gets back to work, combing through the rubble for evidence.*

Who could have done this?
*When you lock eyes, it&apos;s as if fury has become a living thing that comes charging down your veins, all a-howling madness. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;: the man who abducted you and sold you to the Master.*
The Council of Four met here? No wonder Lady Kemm is so proud.
Our home forests are gone. The great trees are cut to pieces. The memories inside them... nearly lost.
*She crouches down, placing a hand on the earthen ground.*
Yit Joph
Ah - my darling Lulabelle. Isn&apos;t she a beautiful creature? A ray of light during dark times- when even a marriage ceremony can get cut short by tragedy.
*The Magister looks at you again. A shake of her head and a flick of her wrist and you&apos;re on your way.*
[2] was destroyed
*Turn and take your leave.*
Your lies end here!
Malady is dead? Then this is the first time I mourn a demon.
*Remember eating stew in Driftwood and muse that you quite liked Harrick too, at the time...*
DICE ROLLER
*Gareth&apos;s fingers open and close around his sword&apos;s hilt. His breathing slows and his face relaxes, yet his arm remains suspended.*
*Your hand reaches through the spirit. Your Source is inert; you see no memories, sipphon no emotions. Its face grows even more tortured. It is trapped. Is this Ryker&apos;s doing?*
Everyone knows that Rhalic is the greatest of the Seven. Just look around you - his children thrive in every corner of Rivellon. The other gods will never match him.
*Stare at the heart. Your stomach trembles at the sight of it. And then you catch the smell...*
Mordus&apos;Akaim
*State that you&apos;re interested in a Conjurer - someone who can summon aid to the battlefield.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54] gold)
*The urn throbs in time with your grief, and thrums into a heartbeat: the familiar &lt;i&gt;rat-at-tat-a-tat &lt;/i&gt;of Peeper.*
The renaissance of dragons would spell the end of our race, plain and simple. To that end I needed you to die, but you proved to be all too worthy an opponent. An opponent I would even now see an ally.
*She was among the Sourcerers with whom you fought the Voidwoken down in the hold of the sinking ship.*
*Touch the globe the figure is balanced upon.*
*Suck up the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Hmm. Never composed a Beast ballad myself, come to think of it. Tell you what. I shall craft a rhyme for you. All I ask in return is a handful of coins. It&apos;s an offer of a lifetime!
Ready Yourself!
See how we turn the world the Seven created against them? We drown their very temples with the &lt;i&gt;oceans themselves!&lt;/i&gt; The God King will smile upon us.
Clever, clever. Yes, I am the Devourer. Join the pieces of my armour together, and you&apos;ll share in my power.
Huntsman
The Doctor appeared. We honoured the pact.
Both Justinia and I can rest safely - or at least, as safely as this Void-ridden world will allow.
Magical Giant Warhammer
Your Intelligence has increased!
*The air around the glowing relic thrums with power, as the Source barrier quietly crackles in the background.*
[SEBILLE] *Tell Ifan that you&apos;re well-acquainted with &lt;i&gt;errands.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The hound raises its nose from the deck. If you didn&apos;t know better, you&apos;d say it looked annoyed.*
*Very well - ask him something else.*

May maggots bugger you for all time, my dear boy.
*Give Tarquin one of the parts and tell him to get to work.*

Yes. Go with your father, my darling. Make me proud!
Looking good!
[OUTLAW] *Lie that you&apos;ve met a Delorus. Offer to trade information. The whereabouts of his brother for the whereabouts of the White Magisters.*
*She glances over towards a smouldering pile of ash on the deck nearby. Something is nestled within it - fragments of scorched bone.*
Marzipan
Stand back! You are not to harm my children! The destiny of my race lies dormant within these eggs. I will die to defend them.
They will walk the same path as you, but they cannot be allowed to reach its end. You must be the one. Only one can wield the power to stop the King. Only &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, Fane.
*Tell her that you heard the Seekers muttering about her. They sounded dangerous...*
[JESTER] *Tell her you bet she&apos;s real fun at parties.*
