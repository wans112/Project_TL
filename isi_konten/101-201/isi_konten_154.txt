*By all means. You could use a little break.*
*The Goddess inside you jerks violently - she&apos;s trying to take control! She&apos;s trying to speak through your mouth.*
Monster Slayer
*You&apos;re not interested in adding troll assassination to your resume. Back away.*
Until we meet again, ben-Mezd.
Terrified by the purity of one of our party, the demon fled the girl&apos;s body.
GET YOUR REVENGE!
The chef? That little slip of an elf killed Magisters? Huh...
Maybe I should. Maybe I will. Yes, that&apos;s what I&apos;ll do, when this war is over and the world is put to right once more. If you&apos;re ever in the Ancient Empire, baby, you&apos;ll look me up, won&apos;t you?
*Observe that her cuts look pretty bad.*
Another one!
In a world of peace you could live forever.
*The captain snaps his fingers, and the skeletal arm you found lunges to join the shoulder of its rightful owner.*
You there, dwarfling. A word!
Save your kudos. I wasn&apos;t brave. I was a coward. I should have buried my blade in him. And... I couldn&apos;t bring myself to do it.
The races united elsewhere.
*The elf visibly shudders and suddenly starts to sweat.*
D-d-don&apos;t... I&apos;ll give you the information. Here. Just... just &lt;i&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;, alright?
*Say that you have news regarding the Mordus situation.*
*She gives you the same cool, steady look, then turns away, blinking back the tears.*
I&apos;m not interested in what I can expect from others. Not anymore. I&apos;m interested only in what I can expect from myself.
Did you find them?! The witch - she has Mihaly!
*The child smiles a ghostly, gap-toothed grin and waves goodbye.*
Get away from me, Sourcerer &lt;i&gt;filth!&lt;/i&gt;
I cannot count the friends I have seen cut down by the Ring, nor the outrages against humanity that I witnessed at their hands.
Stop vanishing while I&apos;m talking to you!
Select your Gift Bag Features
*Say you won&apos;t hand over what&apos;s rightfully yours.*
It&apos;s not about appeasement. It&apos;s about innocent lives. I can&apos;t let you go through with Operation Downfall!
You don&apos;t become the One by winning just a match or two.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell him you&apos;re curious as to how he&apos;s still &apos;alive&apos;.*
*The Sourceress, you learn, opened a portal to somewhere... beyond. The ground shook and cracked wide open, and walls and buildings crumbled. The Void was coming - and still she did not surrender.*
The Weaver
As the new Mother, Sebille found a great forest, and founded a new elven homeland.
We are &apos;aster &apos;aze-&apos;uilders. We construct the finest la&apos;yrinths! We do not give away our secrets! Do your worst.
Ryker died before he could teach us to master our Source powers.
*Offer him a fragrant bowl of the house stew.*
*Nod. You held your own against them when they attacked the Wavedancer.*
*Tell her that Sadha is alive and well. Her safety is assured.*
*The squirrel looks up at you and pats your leg reassuringly. He gives you a nervous thumbs up before turning and galloping away on his cat.*
With their queen dead and the Voidwoken gone, the dwarves held the greatest party in the history of Dwarfdom.
I won&apos;t mourn the demon, but I wish we could&apos;ve saved the host.
Neep? Neep eep?
A man of high expectations shouldn&apos;t lower them for anyone.

*This is where you shall decide once and for all, by trial of combat, who shall ascend.*
How... DARE YOU?! Do you take me for some common trollop? Guards - seize him! I want him to burn!
*Clap your hand on his back. He&apos;s just not used to the calm!*
&lt;i&gt;Yer cupboard can&apos;t hid yeh and nor can yer berth,&lt;br&gt;His daggers don&apos; care &apos;bout the gold that yer worth,&lt;br&gt;He&apos;ll bury yer bones &apos;neath a mountain of earth,&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s docked in the bay and comin&apos; your way...&lt;/i&gt;
*Insist you are nothing like Lucian, and say you&apos;re tired of hearing his name.*
&lt;i&gt;The Doctor is dead... you must... pay!&lt;/i&gt;
...Well yes, of course we&apos;ll continue our research, Quercus, we&apos;re not monsters.
*Confront her. The Deathfog&apos;s been deployed. Perhaps thousands are dead, just as she planned it.*
Not all of us are so... &lt;i&gt;lucky&lt;/i&gt;.
Gods &lt;i&gt;damn&lt;/i&gt;.
Ornate Key
Queen Justinia&apos;s down here somewhere... and that Thieves&apos; Guild too.
Wait, what? This wasn&apos;t how it was supposed to go.
Now, a demon rules, along with his thrall. It is not the most ideal fate for this world. But perhaps not all is for ill. Perhaps.
Now if you&apos;re really quite finished, I believe you have life boats to flee to.
We have spoken to a Sourcerer called Fara, who is frantically looking for her missing daughter, Erma.
*Deny it. You were forced to.*
*She gives you a long, wet-eyed look. Her lip begins to tremble - which on a bear is an impressive sight. She tries not to cry.*
*Lohse shoots you a knowing glance and smirks.*
Two-Handed Wolf&apos;s Head Axe
Not at all! Allow me to elucidate:
Knockdown Arrowhead
Ah! Indeed it is, for Braccus&apos;s axe is two-handed, of course... clearly you are who you claim. Take this message to Braccus - tell him I&apos;m still awaiting his apology, and my patience is wearing thin. Now go!
This little companion describes how to keep all war gear and machinery up and running, what bolt to tighten and what wheels to oil. You had no idea the maintenance of all this stuff was such a handful. One of the pages describes how someone&apos;s oil flask once caught fire, so you decide to make note of it in your recipe book under &apos;Grenades&apos;.
*As your vision clears the spirit is revealed - a lizard. He has eyes only for the lizard Lone Wolf who stands before him.*
We... we can&apos;t take any chances. If we don&apos;t sacrifice Arx, who&apos;s to say what the God King may do?
The injured Seekers didn&apos;t survive.
*Tell them to stop! If they&apos;d worked together instead of arguing, they might have escaped by now.*
Vile people take her - Roost Anlon, and his Lone Wolves. But we meet a hero, and the hero brings her back. Today is a day of glories.
Light Metal Armour
Ho ho! Ain&apos;t come to shake me down fer me knickers, have ya? They&apos;re all I&apos;ve got left after yer buddies were through with me!
Honoured One! We have time to speak later, but first I must speak to Sebille. Too long do I keep silent. Too long do I wait. No more.
You never lose hope, do you? I admire that.
*As he gets closer you can see his eyes, which looked black from a distance, are actually filled with tiny points of light. It&apos;s like gazing into the cosmos...*
We stand warned, don&apos;t we?&lt;br&gt;
Because I refused to slaughter Magisters?
*Tell him Sallow said he should take a bath.*
She&apos;s an appraiser, and a damned good one at that. Kemm&apos;s obssessed with his own riches. He brings Cat in to tell him how much his collection&apos;s worth, then basks in his wealth like a lizard in the sun.
Servant of the God King
Bye, handsome. See?! I can lie! This is the best day of my life!
Do you think I missed the centuries passing? The beast may be rotten as I, but his curses remained. At least, until our new master arrived.
*Tell him that you are, in fact, Godwoken.*
To help expand our Source powers, Saheila offered to connect us with the roots of Ancestor Trees across the world. We refused.
They are Godwoken too. But &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the one who will be a god, none other. Keep your claws sharpened and your eyes bright and keen.
Oh, but I see... You are a cunning devil, Quercus. Of course! If it escaped the Great Acorn&apos;s vile servants, it can do so again!
Abyssal Tentacle
*No sooner have you entered the room than Sebille shoves you onto the bed and starts tearing at your clothes.*
*The girl&apos;s hand drops limply - whatever strength she mustered has dissipated.*
*Ask if Arhu has been at Kemm&apos;s lately.*
*Nod. This is his son.*
&apos;Here lies Jona Freed, life-long woodsman.&apos;
*Catch on fast and tell him yes, you&apos;re here to &apos;water his flowers&apos;.*
Encyclopedia of Flora
Good day to you. And stay clear of the cave; it&apos;s for Magisters only, and we run a pretty tight ship round here.
*Remark that with their witch dead, returning to their true forms may be... problematic.*
Break into the Magisters&apos; barracks, find their records, and seek out the Sourcerers listed within. Without their help you will never have the strength to complete your journey.
UNDEAD ELF
*The Magister&apos;s face relaxes for a moment, then hardens once again.*
Work, of course. The great work never ends, and now my tools are aboard whatever vestiges remain of the Lady Vengeance in the Hall of Echoes. That&apos;s were I shall be.
I need to ascend.
*The deer&apos;s head lurches forward, clamping its mouth over your arm. You can feel half of your vitality slowly drain away.*
Aye, there&apos;s enough of &apos;em about. But don&apos;t you worry none: Gareth will be back soon. Then we&apos;ll be home in two shakes of a lamb&apos;s tail.
I wouldn&apos;t expect anything less.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Really? Are you... &lt;i&gt;hospitable &lt;/i&gt;too?
Source Fountain
*Flash an intimidating smile. If they think Braccus was bad, they should see your curses...*
I may fall, but I rise once more. Thou canst not force me to remain down.
Of course you do.
Please, I was no more an elf than you are those rags you&apos;re wearing.
Bark At The Rune: Venom Rune
Well, look at that. The Silver Claw is back.
Cracked Amulet
Did you regret your deal with the Demon Divine - or was the price of power just something that had to be paid?
Zeal
The Hold
Nullified Resistance
It&apos;s Jonathan. He is my friend. Or... &lt;i&gt;was, &lt;/i&gt;anyway.
*Cry out in frustration. Enough! They need to cut to the chase.*
*He passes his gaze over the woman&apos;s remaining family, then to a corpse bleeding out nearby. A child&apos;s corpse.*
*Take pity on the poor beast and concede that, sure, he might wake up.*
Don&apos;t I know it! And I bet there&apos;s a dwarven highwayman hiding in every other bush!
Good gods! There&apos;s... There&apos;s been a murder here.
Marketplace 04
*Wonder about Arhu. Has he seen the Grandmaster, by chance?*
Found you! One more down, one more to go!
But what if I were Voidwoken no longer?
Step back, step back... you lizards don&apos;t know your own power!
*She blushes deeply.*
*Relics, eh? Ask if he found anything juicy down there.*
Arrow Silver
Combat Abilities
*The lizard hangs from the gibbet, her face bloodied and her scales discoloured. Her eyes are closed, but her tongue flickers as you approach.*
*His eyes travel from your face to your feet, then back again.*
*You sense the growing danger. Walk away while you have the chance.*
A note begrimed with graveyard clay.
You and her are one, Red Prince. So go to her. Meet with her. &lt;i&gt;Love her.&lt;/i&gt; Let dragons be our destiny!
*The Seeker&apos;s head twitches upwards as you approach. His eyes open a fraction...*
The bad things under the sand are dead, I think. But you... you smell funny!
Our behaviour during the ritual earned the elves&apos; disapproval.
Take it or leave it.
QUIET!

Force Push
I&apos;ll follow your lead, but please - be careful. If the Magisters see me, I&apos;m done for.
I can understand this reads &lt;i&gt;&apos;In the footsteps of the Eternals&apos;... &lt;/i&gt;but what that means remains to be seen.
You. Are. Cleverer. Than. You. Look.
*A razor smile unfolds upon his lips. But his eyes are gone. The light in them has turned black. Any time he may have had as a sane and functional human is well and truly over.*
We have more important things to do than terrorise some simple dwarves. Come, let&apos;s be on our way.
