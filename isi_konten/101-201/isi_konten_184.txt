Follow the wind, traveller.
Vines sprout from the ground to block the path in a target area, emitting poison clouds around them.
What can I cook up today?
*Who has time for this? Draw your weapon.*
Thank you for freeing me from that awful place! The air is so much clearer here: wild and free, just like me!
I admire your bravado. I hope it doesn&apos;t prove fatal.
Meowwwww.
*Sebille eyes the tip of her needle as if meditating upon its lethality. Then she looks at you and smiles self-assuredly.*
Well... my nephew. Gwydian. He&apos;s got Source in him. Now that his folks are gone, we&apos;ve all he&apos;s got. He&apos;s been stayin&apos; with us. We thought we could keep him safe.

Mystical Giant Flame Rune
Aye, sir!
He eats to &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; me, to free this spirit from its earthly ties. With each peck, I am closer to the Hall of Echoes.
*Nod. This Operation Downfall sounds serious. What else does he know about it?*
*She squeezes your hand gently, the soft skin of her fingers gently resting on your bone. &apos;Hush now, child,&apos; she whispers. &apos;None of that matters now.*
*It is no longer just the spirit&apos;s eyes that zip about, but his head, too. His panic rises and rises - and then he is gone. All that remains of him now flows within you.*
I fear not death, for I shall have eternal life. Yow should fear your own demise &lt;i&gt;- for yow it is your end!&lt;/i&gt;
*Sallow leans forward with a sharp breath. Your mind tingles as his tendrils slash across it. A single phrase, burning in your mind&apos;s eye: &apos; L A S T . C H A N C E . &apos;*
*Steer the conversation in another direction.*
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;DUSTY FANG&lt;/b&gt;.*

Guards! This one threatens me, your royal princess! KILL HER!
The prayer... it brought me here.
*He blinks once. Twice. A single salty tear drips from one ghostly eye. The bell falls silent.*
It&apos;s no use - I&apos;m liable to do more damage than good without both hands to work with.
We picked up the untainted egg.
This prisoner is on remand, pending re-evaluation of her case. It seems Lord Kemm was not the judge we thought him to be.
You! You&apos;re not supposed to be here!
Piercing resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
What, does the ground turn to glue when you&apos;ve been naughty around here?
Lucian said, &lt;i&gt;&apos;Only fools despise discipline&apos;.&lt;/i&gt; We wait until the Shriekers are purged. It&apos;s not up for debate.

[LOHSE] *Tell him you couldn&apos;t agree more. What could be more boring than agreeing over everything?*
Turret Close
RAWWWWWWWWWGH!
Still, I&apos;d expected quite a bit more from you. I was interested in being owed a favour by a shiny new &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;, not some emperor of the realm.
Magister Swentin
You know me now, don&apos;t you, Fane? Your sister. Your guardian... You were my hero once... You must be so again.
*Say that to avoid the feeling of his tongue on your skin, you&apos;d happily be flayed alive.*

Please select at least one hero.

*Wonder how Ifan got his Lone Wolf moniker: &lt;i&gt;Silver Claw.*&lt;/i&gt;
There&apos;s the rub. I will teach you of course, but only if you do me a little favour first.
I don&apos;t need to hear it. The subject is closed.
*Shake your head. That&apos;s enough!*
Source level contains stickies, do you want them to be copied as well?
Well hello, handsome. Care to hear about the power of cheese? I&apos;ve got wheels, and rounds, and blocks, and rolls... and possibly more. But my wares are... nuanced. With undertones of... something rare.
You do look... &lt;i&gt;able&lt;/i&gt; though. Despite your selfish tendencies - tendencies to which I&apos;m no stranger, truth be told.
I couldn&apos;t understand a word. But maybe I could find someone who does.

Legend has it that the Hall of Echoes runs with rivers of this sweet elixir.

The Knight of Duna has been cursed. Void runs through his veins where Source once flowed. I am sworn to protect the Council and all within it... but that same oath renders me unable to lift a blade against him.
Ridiculous.

This is what everyone&apos;s waiting for.
*Ask her what she&apos;s doing up here. Does she serve Amadia?*

*Narrow your eyes and ask how she knows.*
Dead Viscous Voidling
Gotta get to the Queen, then. This shite sure in the hell goes higher than Lohar. I&apos;ll let &apos;er know about yer deeds, though. Good lad, ya are.
You&apos;re the Godwoken, right? Then maybe &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;can find a way through this damn door!
And one should heed that twicefold for information like this. There is power in names - power far, far in excess of your mortal limits. I&apos;ll not deliver that power unto him. *Spits.*
*Nod in agreement and take your leave.*
You... you seem like a good sort. And this is the first news I&apos;ve heard of my gal in... far, far too long.

CityGuards - Any
*Ryker&apos;s killer stare never wavers. He has an eternity to wait; you do not.*
Alive? I am far from alive.
Hey now! Don&apos;t sting me where it&apos;s tender. I&apos;m liable to keep that gold of yours if you&apos;re mean to me.
I can understand their rage. But I&apos;m not about to lie down and die for it.
*Turning on his heel in a puddle of blood, he smiles his black smile at you once more, and winks.*
Radeka is dead. We should take the Purging Wand from her corpse.
I should be Divine. I am Rhalic&apos;s chosen... and I shall do better than Lucian. I could hardly do worse.
Your soul has bonded with your child&apos;s, my love. Call for it, and it will join you in battle!

My doors only open on the occasion of truth. What you admit to them, you admit to me, lizard.
Baa! Baa!
Mmmhmm. And I bet the Void usurper is also having trouble. Now. Why don&apos;t you stand aside? I tire of your interruptions.

Go and die.
*You&apos;re curious - what does it mean &apos;it&apos;s not too late&apos;?*
Ahh, I caught a blow too many from those card-playin&apos; fat-heads up on the ramparts. Got meself a golden ticket, and didn&apos;t even get the chance to use it.

*You were a cruel mother and a cruel neighbour, prone to deceit and violence. You never understood why such anger consumed you.*
Ever you remain closed, even to yourself. So too the door. Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more. The doors to you shall never open.

*Remain silent.*
Why settle for one spike when three is thrice the thrill?
[IFAN] *You were told tales of Scions in your youth. They are like seeds containing all elvish memories - a safeguard against the destruction of the Ancestor Trees.*
Lvl
We must always strive to help those who suffer. For many years I did not understand that simple truth. For many more I have tried to right the wrongs of my past.
I&apos;ll have &lt;i&gt;both.&lt;/i&gt;
One could argue it is his by right. A duty passed from progenitor to offspring.

It is not safe to rest here...
Maybe if you consider where I am now a place of safety... this is a Deathfog Delivery Device. You &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; that, right?
