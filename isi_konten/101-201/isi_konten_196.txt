First of all: I&apos;m rash. If this comes as some kind of surprise, you ain&apos;t been payin&apos; attention.
Was it you who saved Sir Gareth? From the Magisters?
Good choice.
We consumed Taryan&apos;s Source.
B-o-o-o-ck!
Ha. I needed a laugh. Sorry, bub. That&apos;s the price of a night with Big Z.
Put &apos;em together, and you&apos;ve got an unholy match. Not even delicious, wonderful chocolate can make up for rancid pork fat. No matter how much it may want to.
I see you.
Perhaps my memory will come back with time, but for now, I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s little more I can add...

Cracked Glass Container
[IFAN] *Tell her not to waste her breath, or yours. You stopped praying a long time ago.*
We should be wary, watchful. Next time we may not be so lucky.
*The hooded figure stares at you, holding your gaze. It feels as if she is about to say something, but she hesitates before bowing gently.*
*Look at the box, then back at the Shadow Prince with a wicked smile.*
*Ask her how she did it - how did she save you from being purged?*
Damnation! Please, you must seek it out.
In a way, I was walking alongside the best version of them the entire time.
I don&apos;t care if she thought she had good reason, I can&apos;t believe she was willing to slaughter so many innocents...
*Cut him free.*
*The queen sets out to slay Isbeil. With or without you, she would see justice done.*
Oh. That&apos;s... that&apos;s not good. We&apos;ll talk about this back on the boat, Lohse. We&apos;ll... we&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;to talk about it. But for now, I&apos;m otherwise engaged.
*The room remains just as mute, and just as musty.*
Give up, Sourcerer! Why you&apos;re no better than a lizard!
Figured I knew ya - one of Lohar&apos;s, eh? You&apos;re late. But... guess that&apos;s a good thing. I&apos;ll unlock the door for you...
We came to a ransacked farmhouse, infested with... unwanted guests.
*Wonder why no-one else in camp will help her look.*
We sail for new shores. I just need to give Malady the go-ahead.
*Ask how he knows the child is dead.*
When enabled, the camera moves closer to the characters when in dialogue.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him you wouldn&apos;t dream of it. Unless there&apos;s something pretty in it. Ask if there&apos;s something pretty in the chest.*
Undead! I will strike you down, foul creature!
[LIZARD] *Scowl and say that you&apos;re a noble lizard - there&apos;s no chance that some half-dead elf would know you.*
Report back to me as soon as you&apos;ve confronted this... this &lt;i&gt;cook&lt;/i&gt;. If she&apos;s indeed behind all of this, she must face Magister justice!
Slipped her noose in Fort Joy... I&apos;m not too worried about slipping it again.
I, Sworn follower of the God King, was victorious. The world of the Seven usurpers will end. The God King claims his prize at last.
*Queen Justinia sucks in her cheeks, then offers you her unwavering hand.*
[MYSTIC] *You can feel a dark power in the air, controlling these minds. Focus your abilities and try to drive it away.*
Elven Battle Axe
*Wet your lips and show him exactly how you feel.*
Magical Metal Staff
You may find more excitement than you desire out in the world. But please, stay here for as long as you will.
Ally with me, Red Prince. Find Sadha... and kill her. If she births dragons, all other races will unite against us. And this time, they will destroy us for good. We were &lt;i&gt;spared &lt;/i&gt;last time. The condition of our continued existence was that we&apos;d never let the dragon roar again.
*The guardian chokes on her words, as if strangled by an invisible hand.*
Did you inform my men yet? Did they find the tinkerer?!
Candor
*The egg is smooth and glossy-dark, like some rare volcanic mineral. From deep within its core, a fiery glow pulsates, almost like a heartbeat.*
Gold
*He points his finger at the Lone Wolf guard.*
Magister Shield
*...of rushing water.*
But I do. And I won&apos;t forget. I am &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; now.
Good! *Cough* Hmmm. Close by as the gull flies! Hardly a saunter! Toodeloo!
*She drives the needle in deeper and whispers:*
Medusa Head
*Tell him to go on.*
Of all things, I wouldn&apos;t have thought my cloak would give me away, but you&apos;re quite right of course!
I&apos;m grateful for ya - I&apos;m due some rest. May yer god bless yer kin, and their kin.
Saboteur
Oh why do humans do anything? The man was probably driven mad with power. An Eternal would have no such issues.
Unstable Voidling
Well, I got a right-good rebel whooper on hand warnin&apos; of the barbaric Beast! The other&apos;s... well, it ain&apos;t so respectful, but royal guardsfolk on &apos;oliday always ate it up.
Can you hear them? Their roots stretch beneath us, even now...
Right. Yes... indeed.
*With a nod, Ifan strides away.*
autosort
*Ifan grasps your face in his hands and kisses you exuberantly. Source crackles between you, and in the air all around you. The world has &lt;i&gt;changed.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The lizard&apos;s tongue flickers, a wry grin spreading across its snout.*
Not a thing but spiders and disappointment.
&apos;Bonded by Blood - Secured Loans &amp; Speciality Items&apos;
*Ask what she thinks it all means.*
*The eagle glowers at you with one baleful eye, keeping the other eye firmly trained on the stringy morsels of rotting flesh dangling from its beak.*
[LIZARD] *Bow your head in deference and swear that you would never harm a dragonchild.*
We opened the door to the Chancellor&apos;s secret chamber.
Yes, that&apos;s right. Very good, Lohse. Do as I say. We are one. My success is your success.
*Ask why in the world you&apos;d add to the day&apos;s body count.*
Ha! I&apos;d like to see you try! Source courses through this flesh - biting into such power would make your head explode!
*Tell her she&apos;s lucky to have been kicked out - Voidwoken attacked the wedding party. Many of the guests died.*
Back! BACK, citizen! This gate stays locked &apos;til those Voidwoken are &lt;i&gt;DOWN!&lt;/i&gt;
Connection failed: the add-on &apos;[1]&apos; and/or it&apos;s dependencies don&apos;t match the servers. This can be caused by corrupt files or some files have been changed.
Ungh! I can&apos;t stand this noise!
Ah! Well I&apos;m Lyn - pleasure to meet you. And that over there&apos;s Conway, my dearly beloved. And we have us a beautiful boy named Gareth, but he&apos;s off on duty and hasn&apos;t been home in... well, far longer than a mother likes to think about.
To the Dreamer I will take thee, for I too dream...
Looks like a dwarven construction. Seems to be missing a brick.
&lt;i&gt;I heard the same thing!&lt;/i&gt;
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Entangled
Dire? News? DIRE? What is it? Tell me!
A blood vial labelled &apos;Sebille&apos;
Aww, thanks.
You&apos;ve got some nerve, showing your face around here, thief. You&apos;re coming with me!
Don&apos;t be stupid.
[LOHSE] *Wave away your history. Tell him where you come from isn&apos;t half as important as where you&apos;re going.*
Magical Leather Breeches
An elf of principle. I get it. Wonder how you&apos;ll feel when whoever did this does it again.
Oh, how interesting. Perhaps one day, you will enjoy a life as thrilling as mine!
Crafted by the Source King, it was.
You entered the vault? You... please, give that to me. Give it to me now.

Open Book
Well don&apos;t just stand there gawking like an ape at an abacus! Or do you really mean to tell me &lt;i&gt;you don&apos;t know who I am?&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you understand it - more or less.*
*Ifan grimaces and growls at you.*
Turn to the Gods. Their guidance alone will lead you.
*Windego&apos;s spirit quakes. She is no longer the arrogant banshee that summoned a kraken and brought down a Magister vessel, but a fearful child bracing for parental punishment.*
What, have you forgot how things were before the Divine up and kicked it?
She looks as untamed as the wolf she rides.
Got that fog feelin&apos;, like I can&apos;t tell if I&apos;m sleepin&apos;, or if me eyes are just cloudy.
I am blessed, limb-licker, by drudanae and divinity. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.

Stow your weapons. Then we chat.
A pity. Religious persons tend to be all-too self-important in their supposed humility.
The Ancestor Tree Eleanessa was brought here by her doctor to be exorcised. But the demon killed her and laid waste to the island.
Grass Ring
*Stingtail. House of Dreams. You have come here to confront him because he cut the slave mark into your cheek. Perhaps he can undo it, and point you in the direction of the hated Master.*
Meanwhile, we plan another assault. In case you fail, there must be a plan in place. It is better for us all to die than for Roost Anlon to live.
Our customs mean less than nothing as long as these collars choke us, kin.
OH BABY! OH DARLING! I&apos;M SO SORRY! COME TO ME. &lt;i&gt;AND I&apos;LL KILL YOUR SHINING LIGHTS!&lt;/i&gt;
You, &lt;i&gt;Lohse&lt;/i&gt;, are an amalgam too hideous to contemplate. One who has a demon coiled around her Godwoken heart.
Are you afraid of me now?
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her there&apos;s nothing you&apos;d like more.*
I see... destiny. We must enter; there is no time to waste!
*In a flash you are both of them - brother and sister. Your feminine side is a rebel, rising up against the tyrannical Queen. Your masculine side is a royalist, loyal to the monarch he loves.*
A broken lute that won&apos;t play any more sweet songs to sing along to.
*Sidestep him.*
The forces of the Void. They are everywhere. They are &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;.
It&apos;s odd, seeing you here among my things, my practice - especially after that nasty incident with the Deathfog. Usually it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;who visits &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.

*Offer your condolences for the loss of Gwydian Rince.*
*Ask about this investigation - there was mention of a fugitive?*
No. No... have mercy, I beg you!
There&apos;s no escape from justice!
Oh tender flesh. Do you not have places to be? Have you not been given your instructions?
*As you approach, Zorl-Stissa greets you with outstretched arms, though her face is marred by a pained grimace.*
*That sounds ominous. Ask what she wants a book like that for.*
*The Magister slowly shakes her head. To her, that writ might as well be your death warrant.*

Hey, at least I didn&apos;t have to raise mine!
*Her eyes betray a deadly focus on something or someone locked deeply within her mind, and you get the distinct feeling you&apos;d be an unfortunate soul indeed should you be trapped in her tiger-like gaze.*
*Admit that you have sinned, but point out that you probably had good reason.*
*You spot a strange lizard gazing over the water with a steady, malcontent stare. His skin is of a bright, blood-red colour. Could he be...?*
