*Shake him off of you and step away.*
You can&apos;t be serious.
As you wish. I will await you. Come alone.
If there is any evidence that Dallis is behind Arhu&apos;s disappearance, we will find it. &lt;i&gt;Thank &lt;/i&gt;you. Do take this as a token of the Paladins&apos; gratitude.
We healed Jules.
*Smile and say nothing. Once you&apos;ve ascended, you&apos;ll deal with him once and for all.*
Your companion has permanently left the party, but they were kind enough to leave you a backpack containing all their belongings. You can find it in your inventory.
Dunno if my hounds&apos;ll make much of lizard meat. Even dogs have standards.
Name of Migo. Come out of Arx. My daughter&apos;s a Magister. Pretty-haired Yarrow girl. She doesn&apos;t know about all this though. DON&apos;T YOU DARE BLAME HER. Pretty-haired Yarrow girl.
*There&apos;s a small slot in the side of the lever. Almost like a keyhole.*
*Wait.*
Please, Lucian, spare me!
*The figure turns towards you. It snarls in agony and rage - and you feel its mind reach out to yours, searching for a way inside.*
Identify price
Always keep an eye out for new and interesting gear. A demon will make short work of an old, rusty sword.
*She traces a circle on the floor with her left foot, then shakes her head. You&apos;re stymied by the foot-gesture, but the head-shake is more than clear.*
I understand now. You are as dangerous to her as she to us.
I have thought about the prospect of divinity, yes, and about what divinity really means.
Toodleoo, slave.
Just messin&apos; with me, eh? Cruel business, that is.
Damn all the gods, I say. You can all start worshipping me.
*Well you&apos;re hardly surprised. After what he did to you, he had clearly lost his mind.*
The way I see it, they did a pretty good job of containing the baddies in this place. You gotta do what you gotta do.
It shall be done, O Sallow One.
While I&apos;m hardly pleased with Linder&apos;s continuing absence, it&apos;s at least been a pleasure to discover I&apos;ve a bit of a green thumb. The newest seedlings have taken well to the garden&apos;s soil, and include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parrotplant: I&apos;m curious about this one. It apparently repeats what it overhears. Imagine: talking flowers! It will prove either intriguing or annoying. Or both, depending on my mood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hot Kettle: You would suppose fire might destroy such a fragile thing, but no! In fact, you must set it ablaze if you wish to harvest its exotic fruits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wailing Mandrake: I&apos;m told it emits a terrible noise once fully grown, so I&apos;ve contained it in a terrarium all its own.
No, we are the only hope to save this world. You and I alone. But we must hurry. The King&apos;s minions are close. They are so close...
Small Venom Rune
We met a strange witch named Radeka, prowling around the stinking corpses in a mass grave, far below an ancient tower.
Legends say this ancient weapon could even defeat the mighty Braccus Rex.
Eternal Artefact
*Wait for the spirit to calm and ask who did this to him.*
It is good and right that you mourn the dead, Godwoken. But do not let your sorrow linger; many a good warrior has buried his courage along with the dead. Look ahead, not behind.
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;SILVER FEATHER&lt;/b&gt;.*
Whoa - steady on!
No, no, no...
Get robbed, didja? Didn&apos;t manage to catch a name, by any chance?
*Snarl that he&apos;ll have worse than scars if he tries anything with you.*
The drudanae Griff cleverly smuggles into the prison, of course. Stuffed inside the oranges. You don&apos;t think he&apos;d really be so mad over a little missing fruit, do you?
Chain Boots
Finally, an end to this dull conversation.
I was investigating a site where several artefacts of my people had been found. Some were even intact!
Suspicious Hole In Wall
It takes a little while to kick in. See me when you&apos;re in Driftwood, I&apos;ll sort you out for those recipes.
The sooner the better.
*Tell him you will, then bid him goodbye.*
What&apos;s wrong with you. You seem... &lt;i&gt;happy.&lt;/i&gt;
Ball! Ball? Ball. Ball? Ball!
*Say that you are on her side, of course.*
&lt;i&gt;Hail, hail, hail. Hail, hail, hail.&lt;/i&gt;
You liar! You dog! You&apos;ll regret this! You&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;regret this!
That was rather... spectacular. There must be more to this Dallis woman than meets the eye.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 30: Oil Moles
Please, all I know is it wasn&apos;t me!
*She takes you by your arm. Her grip is light, but her tone is firm.*
*As you strike him, the dwarf&apos;s face changes... becomes softer somehow. He almost looks like a different person. When he speaks, his voice is quieter, more reserved.*
Is someone going to eat that? No? All mine then.
Large Poison Bottle
Thief! Thief!
*Confess to the murder.*
*His eyes are black holes in a black-skinned sky. He bows with the deference of a noble among nobles: swinging ever so playfully between sincerity and sarcasm.*
LAN
I do not know what the future will hold, but I&apos;m certain that the past is done. This world is over.
It delivers Deathfog, of course! This is a &lt;i&gt;sliiiiiiightly&lt;/i&gt; modified version of what the Order used during the war.
*Decide that you want Samadel to join you in the battle. Her magic skills could save lives.*
*Tell him you&apos;re the answer to his prayers. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*You want to know but one thing: why?*
One royalist tune comin&apos; up!
I know. I know what lies ahead. You must defeat the God King and become the new Divine.
*Suggest he showed those &apos;fools&apos; that they do, in fact, run the place...*
It&apos;s been a pleasure.
Ooze Spray
Well, no evidence, no reward! Go on! Get out of my sight! May the fog take you, you vile bark breath!
My armour is proof - it is alive, do you see? And it wishes to be whole.
Thanks to the great calamity of our people - the Magisters. They tainted our soil with Deathfog, and uprooted the sacred ancestor trees...
Here, missus! Alexandar doesn&apos;t have to stay dead, does he?
Back off. I wouldn&apos;t enjoy putting you in your place. But I&apos;d still do it.
*Insist he snap out of it. Where is the man of action you met in the swamps?*
Oh, if only death were that simple...
Spirit of a Paladin Protector
Hawk&apos;s Eye
Palisade Door
Hold [IE_FlashAlt] to highlight objects that can be picked up.
Large Rock Rune
My dearest friend. The one who saves me.
There&apos;s little I can do to help you - it&apos;s the altars that have that power. Bow to the altar of Duna, and to those of the others also. If you are worthy, they will show you the way.
A shrewd move, to side with me like you did. Perhaps you have more guile than I give you credit for, Sourcerer.
I discovered the existence of ancient implements called &lt;i&gt;Swornbreakers&lt;/i&gt;. They are rumoured to be able to break any magical pact, including the Covenant.
*He holds the robe to him. Turns to face you. A mischievous smile plays across his lips. Then he lets the robe fall to the floor.*
So the Order&apos;s right about one thing: we attract Voidwoken.
Clear orf.
Dallis&apos; Letter to Reimond
*Say that if she doesn&apos;t tell you what she knows, you&apos;ll consume her spirit and consign her to oblivion.*
Hmm. Think of her as a teacher. The powers of the Seven stir in you. She&apos;ll reveal them to you. Show you how to manipulate them.
You are most welcome to stay and walk with me, my son, should you wish it. My vigil honours the Rhalic in each human child.
But I remember him. I remember him in my head. And it&apos;s all I have left.
Ah. &lt;i&gt;Much &lt;/i&gt;better.
*Say you were born under the waxing moon too.*
Alexandar
I intend to seek them out. This Gustavchen seems to guard portals to their realm. And once I&apos;ve uncovered one, well... why settle for being the greatest mind in just one world, when there&apos;s another for the taking?
*Wonder if they have somewhere safe to go.*
*Ask what will happen to the other Godwoken.*
Change
*Tell him the &apos;Sourcerer&apos; is dead.*
Sparking Swings
Noble
Wayfarer
I await masters only.
*You raise your hand and her Source is pulled towards you. She bows her head in sorrow and in pain as you tear her soul apart and eat it.*
*He&apos;s right, the ship is going down. You don&apos;t have time for chit-chat.*
*A wan grin spreads across Beast&apos;s face, but his eyes aren&apos;t smiling. He is lost in thought and focused only on this place, and on this moment.*
*Shake your head. There was no bomb there, not that you found.*
Return to Gareth.
The Art Of Destruction: Fiery Infusions
Perhaps you&apos;re right. We&apos;ve been searching for hours - he must have slipped away.
We found Charlie&apos;s ball.
By Lucian&apos;s locks, stop fidgeting lad!
A plain cloth shirt.
*The Meistr turns to you, her eyes wide with worry.*
Of course it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;rather specific&lt;/i&gt;. Quite obviously I&apos;m musing over the very actual empire that I lost!
*The spirit looks away from you towards the carnage around.*
*The spirit of a robed woman casts a critical eye over you.*
Paladin Checkpoint
Word of battle. Word of our Magister brothers and sisters. What can you tell us?
*Press for details. He mentioned Paladins. Who are they?*
The wind whispers your name. You are the new Mother.
*The door seems like any door - at least at first. Then you notice its unblemished wood. There is no knot, no scratch, no dent to detract from its apparent perfection.*
I&apos;m not going to just take your word for it. Guilt&apos;s written all over you!
And with good reason, too! For isn&apos;t it &lt;i&gt;wonderful&lt;/i&gt; to look upon so simple a meal: bread and cheese, and be positively overcome with appetite?
[SOLDIER] *Chuckle and say that a few jail guards aren&apos;t the worst foes you&apos;ve come up against.*
*The young man is silent.*
*Shake your head. You&apos;re being confused for someone else.*
*You&apos;re about to turn away when the body twitches.*
Sets enemy characters around you on fire. Deals [1] to each. Ignites all susceptible surfaces.
*So Fane actually knew the Gods? Ask what they were like.*
You killed the Voidwoken! This city needs more like you.
Finn didn&apos;t see it like that. He was desperate for us to help him. Two things scared the living daylights out of him: His own shadow, and his own Source.
Voidwoken. That means Source was used... Which means some third party must have attacked first, and I&apos;ve a fair idea who that might have been.
By Amadia&apos;s wand, I owe my freedom to a damned clown. Here, just &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; a book. Its wisdom might do you some good.
*Tell yourself you&apos;re being hypnotised. Try to see the truth behind the beauty of her voice.*
Magisters and Paladins, fighting alongside each other... a rare sight indeed.
...Beast? This can&apos;t be. You said he was upon the beach, yes? I need to have a look myself. This... this simply can&apos;t be.
*Ask him what he&apos;s doing in this infernal bog, anyway.*
But you wouldn&apos;t eat a whole one, I suppose?
*He stands head bowed, as the blessing courses through him. He raise his hands before him, marvelling at their glow. He looks at you at last, his mouth agape...*
*Sigh.* What bollocks. I ain&apos;t no hero. Besides, you know how the rest goes. Hell, you&apos;re helpin&apos; to write it. Magisters haul me off, and soon enough I&apos;m headin&apos; to Fort Joy, collared like the beast I am.
These gloves bristle with barely-restrained violence, seeming difficult even to wrestle onto your own hands. Once you&apos;ve struggled them on, best tell those you love to stand well back...
Atrophy
