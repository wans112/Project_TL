This luminescent jewel is clearly meant to resemble an eye. Luckily, it doesn&apos;t wink.
*Scratch your head. Where should you begin?*
Moving Container Panes
Say my name, you cankerous boor. &lt;i&gt;Say my name.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you have a healing potion; perhaps that could help.*
*Ask Ifan what he did to find himself at the mercy of a subordinate.*
You fight well - and you fight on the right side, too. Keep it that way.
Give them your protection as they search for the Soul Jars in your name.
High Judge Orivand
*...there&apos;s a loud BANG as a rivet flies across the cavern, followed by an intense hiss of steam. The contraption sparks and trembles...*
*As Voidwoken attacks go, you think, that one was particularly devastating. The great city of Arx may be finally ready to fall.*
Wind Generic 05
*Say she&apos;s not the first to play this game. A Dreamer showed her to you as well.*
Puffball
Or... I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;, I guess. In heart if no longer in name. Duna rest his soul.
*Note that he seems a little dazed - perhaps he&apos;s in shock, after everything that unfolded.*
*Hand over the gold.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
Is that the Lord Dread? Or what&apos;s left of it?
*Tell her not to worry, you&apos;ll be fine.*
I ain&apos;t buyin&apos; that without an order from Julian or Reimond himself. Think I&apos;ll leave the prisoner right here for the time being, and you can be on your way.
Bak bak bak bakahhhhhhhhhhk!
And so we fight and fight again, and fight until the moment where we find our home once more.
Turquoise Necklace
*Turn and walk away. Quite fast.*
*The gargoyle stirs, the dust of millennia drifting from its pocked wings.*
*He smiles a foxy smile as he stabs claw-like fingers at your chest.*
*Say that you know that the Lady Vengeance led Dallis to you on the Nameless Isle.*
Now then. On a more serious note. How about a hug?
Hotbar Assignment: Skills and Inventory
Black Flag Huntsman
*He smiles shyly in remembrance of that special night.*
Yes.
*The dog squeaks the ball repeatedly, happy as a clam.*
I... don&apos;t dare say it now. Not while her &lt;i&gt;guest &lt;/i&gt;is listening.
Times are hard... there&apos;s not much gold to be made in scholarly pursuits. I can&apos;t ignore my first calling though, especially when there&apos;s so much to learn...
*Ask what this place is.*
Meanwhile, the Magisters feast on honeyed meat behind this very wall. The indignity...
You are fortunate to have found this place. The Hollow Marshes swallow life and regurgitate only the dead.
*Crouch closer to the ground and tell the figure you have no quarrel with it; you don&apos;t even know what you&apos;re doing here.*
Axe of Braccus Rex
Unlock Hotbar
*Tell him that&apos;s a rather specific vision he has there. Why an empire?*
*Tatcher doesn&apos;t look disrespected. Tatcher looks amused.*
I want that wall reduced to rubble, do you hear me?!
A sliver of honour maybe? Not all rewards come in coin, dwarf.
Ifan fought me for Divinity.
In-game Time
*Dodge the issue. Ask why he killed Baran.*
I&apos;m not supposed to talk to lizards.
The Mother would bid you leave. Do not wait for her to change her mind.
Nothing to be concerned with, I assure you. Mere husks. Nothing like yourself.
You know, as in &apos;gorilla warfare&apos;? Girl, I thought you had a funny bone in ya, but I swear some witch doctor&apos;s gone and yanked it out!
Scale Gloves
*He giggles coquettishly, then bellows like a bear.*
Come on, now&apos;s no time for chatter.
*Shrug. You&apos;ve had practice.*
Wonder what it means. We could use something useful!
Ballistic Shot
*Sashay over to him. Undo the clasp on his robe.*
This- this is wrong. This isn&apos;t mine. Where is mine? Where is my Soul Jar?!
My tummy hurts.
What are you doing here?! This is private!
*Say you haven&apos;t seen any spirit.*
You&apos;ll be silent or you&apos;ll be gagged.
*Lie there and hope they won&apos;t notice you.*
*Smile and say somehow you doubt that.*
*Tell the door you came to apologise.*
Vampiric Voidwoken
Flanged Mace
*The forceps slip from his hand and strike the floor. He gives you an abashed look.*
You&apos;d do well to get in his good graces. Won&apos;t last long in here without &apos;em. Runs the kitchen, he does. Make yourself useful and he&apos;ll take good care of ya.
Static Cloud Arrow
*Though his wounds are heavy, Lohar begins backing away from you.*
*End the conversation.*
Ancient runes? Weird contraptions? This place is an arcanist&apos;s dream!
I consider that an admission of guilt. Prepare yourself!
*He&apos;s right. Give the Swornbreaker to Sadha.*
As such, my first priority remains to find Roost. He is the pawn that will eventually topple the king.
Spiritual Boots
Braccus Rex, the long-dead Source King raised from the dead in the search for the Aeteran, vanished entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some say he still walks the world, others that he has gone back underground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing is true - no-one has met him and returned to tell the tale.
*Give him the go-ahead. This is his time to shine.*
[IFAN] *Lean in close to catch the scent of the stone.*
*He gives you a grim nod, then turns away.*
There&apos;s comfort in that, at least. Some.
Escape from Fort Joy
Just... see that he&apos;s safe. Please.
A worn-out sheet of paper addressing insignificant topics, which was probably used at some point to clean up a cup of wine.
The Whites are in their hidden vault, and that&apos;s all I know. Now please, leave me the hells alone.
Amulet of the Deep
Very well then, but if you find anything suspicious, report it at once.
Fine, you got me. Now can we please move on with the investigation?
Living forever under the rule of a wise king is one thing, but if that king should turn into a despot?
Find the place where the Dreamer discovered her people. I will draw strength from there to speak again.
Pilgrims. Probably here for Lucian&apos;s Day.
Get away from me, foul blasphemer!
Ha! You fell for it! Get it? Fell for it? *Giggle*
You could say that my darling herbs flower in the flesh and blossom in the brain.
*Refer to his second riddle and ask what he meant by the &apos;cure&apos; to Source.*
W-w-whatever do you mean by &lt;i&gt;that?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This tome contains no text. Instead, sketches of dragons fill every page. The artist is hardly talented, but clearly enthusiastic.&lt;/i&gt;
You&apos;ll have to do better than that, merc. I&apos;ll need &lt;i&gt;proof.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask Ifan just how he plans to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; that, exactly.*
It is over. For now.
Did you... hear something? When you were in the water, I mean.
*Decline. You have companions to think about.*
Can&apos;t cast, attack, or interact with objects. Bock-bock-BOCKAW!
Beetle Die
This herbal brew is infused with falcons&apos; tears to imbue the drinker with superior speed.
Using a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Teleporter Pyramid&lt;/font&gt; on the ground will leave it behind. Pick it up first if you wish to take it with you!
Why is this happening? I didn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;anything!
I have no plans whatsoever, beyond dusting my head for crud and cobwebs. After that - well, as long as the essence of Nemesis finds a way to leak into Rivellon, there&apos;ll be hunting to do.
Demon elf! I should do unto you as you did unto him!
*Pat the cub on the head and turn away.*
We read The Essence of Existence, Volume One.
Alright... so be it. Now please, listen carefully:
Toggle Camera Rotate
*Kinnet raises feeble hands to fend off your approach, shuddering in horror.*
He kept a socket peeled for signs of the Eternals, hoping to find the wife he&apos;d lost.
*Say that there must be a way to overcome these things - nothing&apos;s invincible, after all...*
*Sigh and try to think of something else to ask it about.*
[UNDEAD] *Slowly nod. You&apos;ve had occasion to receive Amadia&apos;s blessing as well.*
There are powerful Sourcerers in the region. They might be able to help us where Siva cannot.
Knocked Down
If anyone knows how to get to the crypt of the Divine it&apos;s Arhu, Keeper of the Cathedral.
Just one thing at a time I guess. First, I go back to the kingdom. There&apos;s a lot to do there. Damage that needs undone. Dwarves&apos;ve lived in fear for too long, on the outside &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the inside.
I knew you would say that. But I also know you need hope and fellowship. I&apos;ll mark a place on your map where you can find both.
*Admire its size and girth.*
New Save
*Suddenly, a great energy enters the crown of your head and melts downward, infusing every inch of you with a feeling of great power.*

*His tongue darts out from between his lips to taste the air once more.*
Leech
*Still reeling from the pain you heed his command and kneel.*
*Say you read it - but you&apos;re not sure why you need to be involved.*
Roost expects Ifan to deliver the Godwoken to a sawmill somewhere in the region.
*For a moment, his mind wanders to memories of friends and enemies, of Malady and Magisters, of demons and Divinity. He is then in the present once more, and smiles at you.*
*Say that if she knows a way for you to get out of here, you&apos;d really like to hear it.*
Haven&apos;t got a spare soul in your pack, do you? No, no.. this is all, you know. You know...
Some say he still walks the world,
None of your BUSINESS, you rat!
Best of luck, Red Prince.
Vermin. Thieves. Pests. Leeches.
(I think she&apos;s leaving, Mabel!)
*Press on further. What curse threatens her?*
I&apos;ve sent Magister, er, Barwick to investigate the tavern&apos;s kitchen. We&apos;ll soon know if you&apos;ve been truthful or not...
The magic this ring bestows upon its wearer allows them to charm friend or foe, then ravish them in any way they see fit.
*She slaps you hard across the cheek.*
Oh, yes. I imagine it was.
Marrow
There was, of course, &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; singing involved.
Let alone forgive.
*Nods.* &lt;i&gt;*Grunt...*&lt;/i&gt;
*Your words are swallowed by the chamber&apos;s thick air.*
*Tell her that her groom doesn&apos;t love her. He only married her for her money.*
*Daring escapes? Talking to gods? Boast that it&apos;s just another day for you...*
It is by far Sanders&apos; greatest achievement. He was one of the engineers, you know. Brilliant fellow. I suspect the strain left him... broken. He makes toys now. A waste of his genius, but a great gift to the children of Arx.
Speak with the Magisters.
The presence within wakes. It wants to be whole.
Fort Joy - Dungeons
*Relent and say you&apos;ll try to find Arhu first.*
A place like this must have plenty of secrets.

You will? Oh... bless you. Bless you.

Defeat the Eternal.
*Tell him you know his family, and they&apos;re waiting for him. But not all of them made it...*
*Your body convulses with Zorl-Sitssa&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile grows at the sight of your agony.*
Madness within, madness without.
*Shake your head. She doesn&apos;t remember anything?*
[SOLDIER] *An attack on one is an attack on the unit. You understand his zeal.*
I tell you one final time: keep your hands to yourself!
*Quietly step away and leave them in peace.*
[OUTLAW] *Offer to find the culprits. You&apos;ll have their heads!*
I want Lohar&apos;s head on this here table.
Thank you again for all you&apos;ve done for us.
*Stand back and watch her.*
I&apos;m - ah - not supposed to be trading with the other... guests. Roost&apos;s orders.
*Pocket the money and walk away.*
*A spirit peers down at his own remains with morbid fascination. His ghostly form takes on a queasy shade of green.*
*She yanks her head towards the far end of the room.*
