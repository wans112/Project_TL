Must be nice to be born with Lady Luck&apos;s golden spoon in your mouth. Enjoy it while you can. All my life I served her and see how it ends? In the dirt, just the same as everybody else.
Target must be [1]
*The voice disappears, and with it the cloak of ash around you. A new presence lingers close, cold as death.*
What?
All of this, Quercus. All of our struggle to save their stupid bloody giant races and this fool lets a demon infect the world.
We persuaded the spirit of Brother Kalvin to let us enter the inner chamber of the vault.
*Dig your fingers into her sides and tickle until she relents.*
*Leave his spirit be.*
Well, looks like I was wrong after all. No hard feelings, I hope.
Good riddance to them.
Magical Leather Gloves
Move Camera Backward
[UNDEAD] *Look &lt;i&gt;undead.*&lt;/i&gt;
This place will be nice when it&apos;s finished.
*Your blood is rising in your veins; shivering, tensing - tell her yes, like that.*
Did he show mercy or strength? Did he sacrifice others as Lucian had done? Did he regret becoming Divine? Did he wonder if he should have given his soul and sealed the Veil?
Some say Afrit, his soulwolf, walks the forests still.
I hired someone like &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;so I would not be seen to be involved. Imbecile...
&lt;b&gt;Ha! The Aeteran? The Godslayer? It&apos;s a myth. It was a myth when I was still new to this world.&lt;/b&gt;
No-one deserves this torment. Give her the Swornbreaker, free her from the covenant.
Easy for you to judge - you can just stroll out of here whenever you please! How about you go and do that now, and leave me the hell alone?
I - I&apos;m not sure. I need to think about this.
I&apos;m sorry, darling. It&apos;s a set-up. They want to rob you. Please, Gill, not this time.
*Ask the spirit who she is.*
We rescued Saheila, daughter of elven leader Tovah. Saheila turned out to be crucial to the survival of all of elvendom.
Ah. One of Lohar&apos;s, are you? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; should know better than to stick your clumsy fat fingers in the Queen&apos;s secret operations.
Interesting. Seems I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; mistaken. Must have been the predator that I smelled on you indeed, not the magic that dare not speak its name. That much we have in common...
Ifan&apos;s old boss Roost and his Lone Wolves are hunting Godwoken. Roost was last heard of in Driftwood.
&lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt; Hey, wanna have some fun? &lt;i&gt;Hahaha!&lt;/i&gt;
Apply status to target
I can&apos;t deal with any more interruptions today.
*Say nothing. Stand beside her, taking in the scene: Thousands, millions of souls, trapped here by the demon inside you.*
...Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
&apos;til next time, darling.
*Say it&apos;s a shame it all had to be cut short by the attack.*
You! Vandal! I&apos;m taking you to a prison cell. Nothing you can destroy in there, now is there?
In a place not even the dead could invade! The traps which surround it are of a cunning not seen in a thousand years, and-
A wealth of knowledge, not of shiny trinkets...
Just as I thought. You die here and now, Sourcerer!
...and do not concern yourself with the well-being of the servant within - he has had his chance. Perhaps his death will gain you the confidence of the prisoner.
Ain&apos;t you the poet? &apos;ere - &apos;f Death comes near me, I&apos;ll rip &apos;is boney &apos;ead off.
*Step away from the cursed soldier and take your leave.*
*Kemm nods.*
But it matters not now. Your contract will go unfulfilled. Look around. You&apos;re outnumbered, outmatched.
Dashing June
To betray me shall cost you everything.
*The crocodile tries to shuffle to its feet, but soon gives up and slumps its head.*
*Look confused: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Ifan? Ben-Mezd? What are you talking about?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
[OUTLAW] *You smell an opportunity and ask her to elaborate.*
I &lt;i&gt;hunger&lt;/i&gt; for you, Ifan. There&apos;s no stopping me now.
F17
This is bad news, cupcake.
*Leave the spirit to her grief.*
May the Devourer bless your endeavors, champion of the dragon.
Immune to Freezing
You know, I had looked forward to something of a vacation. A bottle of something strong, a lover or three hundred. Now it seems I&apos;ll have to focus on preventing endtimes. &lt;i&gt;Again.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you are.*
I am truly sorry, Lohse, but do not despair. I will not give up on you. We must simply take a darker path still: confront Adramahlihk in his lair and deal with the demon, face to face.
I can&apos;t offer you more. May the memory of our kiss remain... sacred. And may you remain ever as graceful as the day we met.
*The spirit of the poacher suddenly turns and notices you. It is the last thing that he does.*
What&apos;s that?!
Mage&apos;s Gloves
You make the world worse simply by moving through it, and I will not be a part of your caravan of misery any longer.
*The boy begins to cry.*
*She spits at you. From the darkness of the look in her eye, there&apos;ll be no talking to her.*
I see you. The trial remains incomplete.
Do you know you are not welcome here, therefore soon to be cast out, therefore leaving me in peace in my cellar?
*The Magister grumbles under her breath.*
*Bar the doors into your mind and take your leave.*
War is coming. We shall harrow the earth with the blood of humans, lizards, and dwarves, and from it a new forest shall grow.
*Ask him what comes next.*
Polymorphed
Look - I don&apos;t want to do this, but I&apos;ve got orders...
Go on then. Tell me the one about the waiter and the dog and the horses.
We all want to escape, but the Magisters, they have these... &lt;i&gt;Shrieker&lt;/i&gt; things that kill anyone who tries to pass. We barely managed to flee from them the last time...
Take heart, kin. Saheila says the Mother chooses her heir. There is hope for the elves. For all of us.
Catching, killing - I don&apos;t care! There&apos;ll be gold for whoever puts an end to this rat.
You got a problem with simple instructions, friend?
*Then the awareness recedes from you, ebbing back like a tide until you are left completely alone. Alone with your thoughts, alone with the blessing Amadia left you with.*
You&apos;re wrong there. I&apos;ve heard rumours of... well... let&apos;s just say that there&apos;s other places where I&apos;d be appreciated, more than I am in Driftwood...
Of course, I&apos;d much appreciate it if we manage to find Bahara first.
*RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRR!*
No, it didn&apos;t!
*Leave it be.*
*Go down on one knee and ask Her Highness if she&apos;d make you the happiest lizard in the world by accepting your proposal of marriage.*
We entered the Academy - part of the Council of Seven. We draw ever closer to the Well of Ascension, and Divinity.
*You disagree - you and your kin make up the most powerful race on Rivellon. Your Empire has stood since time immemorial, and your bloodlines are pure.*
Then... the prophecy is secure? They will fly. They will fly. They will fly...
Barworth! How many times?! &lt;i&gt;Don&apos;t let just anyone walk right in here!&lt;/i&gt;
No... no, this can&apos;t be...
*The capacitor sparks and fizzles, then the pulsating light begins circulating throughout the automaton...*
&lt;i&gt;...death is but an illusion...&lt;/i&gt;
For you? Hell no.
My princess! Noooo!
Baby will hatch soon. Baby will grow! And I&apos;ll watch over him.
You... your time is short... your time is short...
You&apos;re in luck, Sourcerer. Gareth&apos;s back, and he&apos;s going to get us out of here - all of us!
Fitting, I assure you. Not that you&apos;ve much time to grieve, for &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;are soon to follow.
My journey has ended, but the world still needs a Divine.
*Stare through the bars at Alexandar&apos;s unconscious form, and note that the Seekers have a valuable bargaining chip.*
the monsters swarmed.
The log described the life of Sech Zapor, a pirate captain who worked for Braccus Rex. It speaks of his enchanted armour, which is now hidden around the island. It repeated the phrase &apos;High and hale waves take us&apos; over and over.
Really? And he had all those pets? He sounds so weird!
Good luck on the Path of Blood, pilgrim. I hope you&apos;re truly free from sin.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Red Prince - the prey that my master seeks... Godwoken...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
[LOHSE] *Tell him the whole of it: You were giving a concert, your Source flared up, the crowd went mad (and not in the good way), and they took you right after.*
The feeling is most mutual. Blessed are we, then, that it shall not happen. I was a Master of the Source once, but no longer.
Go now, Beast. Rivellon and its Masters await.
Trouble is, we came across something no-one ought to have. Not the Magisters, not my folks, not the gods themselves.
[OUTLAW] *Tell him that you did bring in &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; culprit. You deserve your reward.*
*You see so much. Flashes pass before your eyes, none of them indicative of what&apos;s in front of you. Your so-called blindness is a red herring. You are nothing &lt;i&gt;but &lt;/i&gt;sight.*
A more potent version of the Ferocity herbal mixture whose effects should last quite a bit longer.
And who would&apos;ve thought it? You&apos;re sure not the collared wolf I first met, that&apos;s for sure! You belong to Rivellon now.
Find the Mother Tree.
The drudanae&apos;s inside the oranges, prince. Do with it what you will...
*He looks away, whistling an old outlaw tune pointedly. It&apos;s clear that your presence is unwelcome here.*
It was quite the august display of violence, but I must question your business acumen, Godwoken. It is not recommended to deny the terms of a deal, only to carry out the requested task.
Unknown Body Part
Hmm. Care is not the point. The point is right and wrong.
Easy there, chief. I don&apos;t bite. Or have cooties.
Howdy. Feeling better?
I will be your surgeon - that much I promise - but first you must do as I&apos;ve asked. Then we&apos;ll operate.
Vitality
Your Majesty...?
Sanguinia Tell gave us a loan. For collateral she took a vial of our blood.
We don&apos;t move from here - &lt;i&gt;not one inch&lt;/i&gt;. The Sallow man wants us here, so we stay here until he says otherwise.
I warned you already - you can&apos;t just come in here as you please! I have an investigation to carry out!
*Thank him and agree to meet him there.*
I don&apos;t make exceptions for anyone - not even the Divine himself!
The Shadow Prince didn&apos;t show.
Take a breath there, friend. We&apos;ve lasted this long, haven&apos;t we?
Well there&apos;s only one Seeker who can help you with that...
The clock ticks to our final breath, twinkle-bugs. But Lucian makes the hours wide and green.
*You scramble forward blindly, but slip and fall. The floor is slick with... something.*
You have returned here too early, my child. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
Fane. &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.&lt;/i&gt;
I hope order&apos;s restored soon. It isn&apos;t the same, praying to the Divine out here...
*The alcohol hits you like the Void itself. Your head spins and your feet feel unsteady. Suddenly, being stuck in a prison ruled by the despotic Order doesn&apos;t strike you as the worst way to spend time.*
So... farewell. May your table always be bountiful.
&apos;Shopp here for Sundries, Oddments, and Generall Miscellany.&apos;
Welcome to the Combat Log. &lt;br&gt;All filters are on by default.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Ask about the other races. What of them?*
Our souls are lashed to this plane, never to enjoy the rest of the Hall of Echoes. It ain&apos;t the afterlife I had planned, if I&apos;m honest. I were sure there&apos;d be more drinking...
Ha! You&apos;re joking, right? Good one.
Boots heavy enough to drag a knight to drowning. Oh.
The payload of the Peacemaker is here.
