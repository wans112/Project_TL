*Leave her to her prayer.*
Not a minute&apos;s rest in this damned city...
*You see Ifan in earnest conversation with the dwarven woman. All of a sudden, he pales and staggers backwards. She laughs, a tinkling sound like glass smashing on a stone floor.*&lt;br&gt;
*Her eyes gleam with a truly unpleasant zeal. Reflected in them you see yourself standing there, white-faced, jaw slack with horror.*
*Ask if it can wait - you&apos;re about to enter the Nameless Isle!*
We needta move on, &apos;n we needta do it &lt;i&gt;now.&lt;/i&gt;
No need to be rude about it. This isn&apos;t the best news I&apos;ve had today.
[SEBILLE] *Say that you know what it&apos;s like to be mutilated by those who&apos;d force you to act against your will. He should consider you an ally.*
Figure out who the girl is.
Ladder
It&apos;s a grim day that such gore would bring me pleasure, but Helan Everhart&apos;s death was wrong, and this goes some way to righting it. Please, allow me to reward you.
Toy Bow
*Tell him he gives up the gear now or he dies.*
Restores Magic Armour.
We destroyed the pillars that held the possessed lizard. Now free, she proceeded to attack us.
*He narrows his eyes to shadowy slits, not a hint of a smile on his face.*
I heard rumour Mordus is working for the Order. What say you?
Hope you don&apos;t go blind after all that.
*The dwarf is interrupted by another crack. You see his femur has developed a break. The fracture spreads, shearing the bone in two. Mordus stumbles to the ground, oddly silent.*
&lt;i&gt;Pardon me.&lt;/i&gt;
*Look nonchalant.*
*Say he was in good spirits. He&apos;s a sprightly one!*
*Say you just can&apos;t believe that you&apos;re meant to save anyone...*
We have ascended the mountain, but our path to the Wellspring is blocked by a gate that refuses to open. The court is filled with statues to the Seven, each with runes of the sun or the moon, but I cannot discern their purpose. I will investigate the temples, for I do believe that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The remainder of the diary is waterlogged and illegible.]
*Whistle and tell him you like his wolf.*
*Keep a hand near your weapon and tell her you meant no intrusion. If she stays civil, so will you.*
Justinia!

Better than one bug-a-boo, which is what I&apos;m stuck with.
Everyday Miracles: Scrolls &amp; Spells
And what makes you such an expert?
Enjoy making a slave of you, will I.
Tell me, Sourcerer - what did you hope to gain by interrupting these proceedings?
Rawf! Rawf!

My husband...? What is it? What&apos;s happened?
Air Shield
What&apos;s... what&apos;s happened?
Bite yer tongue, why don&apos;tcha. Last thing we need&apos;s another bout with the Black Ring.
*He rolls his eyes, sensing his answer didn&apos;t quite satisfy you.*
*Deathfog... Tell him you&apos;ll kill him for asking you to unleash this horror!*
That despite all the blood and guts, it&apos;s been perfectly wonderful.
Hydrosophist Skillbook
It&apos;s hard to know what&apos;s rumour and what&apos;s true. I&apos;ve heard there are Voidwoken in the city walls; I&apos;ve heard the Paladins and Magisters are at war.
Sworn Ancestor Tree
First of all: I&apos;m rash. If this comes as some kind of surprise, you ain&apos;t been payin&apos; attention.
*The burly guard looks around to check that he&apos;s not being watched, then grabs you by the scruff of the neck and hisses urgently in your face, spittle flecking your cheeks.*
*With a glint in her eye, she reaches into her pocket... but then her face falls as she realises that what she was looking for... isn&apos;t there.*
*Ask Ifan why the Magister suspects him of murder.*
Greetings, stranger. May the dawn greet you warmly, and the twilight guide you to peace.
Whatever it was, it has my pity.
It&apos;s a terrible sin to disturb the dead. I&apos;d prefer to leave &apos;em in peace.
*Look down at Lohse; her face is painfully contorted, her skin waxy and lifeless.*
We killed Dunaâ€™s Undertaker.
*You&apos;re done with the dwarf. His Source is yours.*
Meet Brahmos the Wanderer.
ALL will be well.
As we passed through the Hall of Echoes, Alexandar vanished.
*He can&apos;t - or won&apos;t - look you in the eye.*
I am not for sale, fool. Come with me. You need to spend some time in a cell.
Barrel
Spiritless stone. A comfort to the living, perhaps, but never to the dead.
The portal will return you to Rivellon. May the fires that burn within you remain mighty, kin!

*Shake your head. Not this time.*
Plate
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;DUSTY FEATHER&lt;/b&gt;.*
Smoking ominously, this dye will bleach anything to the hue of bone.
Magical Compound Crossbow
If it looks wicked and smells wicked...
My sister Dagmare wrote a leaflet to help me remember, but my eyesight isn&apos;t too good these days. Maybe you could read it?
*Wait. You had a conversation like this before. Apparently you&apos;re not to be trusted.*
What are you doing, dwarf? Trying to get the drop on me? Sneak up and slit my throat?!
&lt;i&gt;...abandon your quest or destroy the world...&lt;/i&gt;
Toy Dressing Screen
Only Sister Avenny has permission to enter, and she quietly lets herself in, deposits whatever refreshments Lord Arhu may require, and leaves in silence, locking the door behind her.
Authority
*The Magister&apos;s mouth twists into a crude snarl.*
Rain and wind! Voidwoken everywhere! And our hero Beast - the valiant, selfless Beast - surrenders himself to the Magisters so the Wavedancer may escape amid the rising chaos! What bravery! What sacrifice...
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the vaults of Bloodmoon Island behind.
Until then, savour your victory! And a spectacular victory it was. Believe me when I say I&apos;m quite, quite impressed.
Thieve again, and great pain is yours.
[SCHOLAR] [MYSTIC] *Insist he stop being so coy. You know he&apos;s a necromancer. It couldn&apos;t be more obvious.*
A storm rages in the target area, hitting enemies with lightning bolts, each dealing [1].
*Roost bursts into laughter, great peals of it wracking his frame. Then, too quickly, he sobers completely and pins you with the venomous stare that earned him the moniker Viper Eye.*
*Insist you&apos;d do it again and more if it meant granting dwarvenkind a free and fearless existence.*
*Say you are proud of who you are, though it takes some effort in the current moral climate.*
As a matter of fact, yes. You doubt it, do you? You think it was all but a trick of the dying mind to stave off the trauma of fast-approaching oblivion?
Ha ha, good joke. You got me!
Perforation
Shiny Ring
I am merely a very honest man.
As per your own testimony, you can cook and groom, but you have the fashion sense of a monkey in a clown suit.
The Scion of the Mother Tree. Let me talk to her, please. She and I have business.
I&apos;ve got no use for empty platitudes - not from some tattooed killer marked as the Seven&apos;s special pet.
To arms! The dead are back! Keep an eye out for their Voidwoken pets.
This has been a difficult day. I think I shall retire.
Here, look down those steps and tell me what you see.
Good to see you. You take care, now. And don&apos;t you let me down!
*The dog stops in its tracks and stands stock-still. The hair on its back bristles as it focuses on a spot in the middle of your chest and growls.*
I. Just. Can&apos;t. Stop. Thinking. About. It. That &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; answer, the one I couldn&apos;t get in time!
*Reflect on the past and future. What happens next for you?*
*Very well. You will go to her and father dragons, as is your destiny. Where is she?*
CHEATER.
Enter.
*Ask how she knows about that.*
*Offer to lend a hand.*
We did as the Paladins asked and received our reward.
A military lance crafted in the Dwarven style.
*Lohse looks bewildered, body trembling with the effort of containing whatever it is that resides within her.*
If so, there&apos;ll be hell to pay.
Feder
All the threads lead back to Alexandar. I want answers.
*Huge, hideous, Voidwoken bees.*
...and soon, the Dwarves will dominate the stage!
*...*
*His jaws clack together in a show of self-assurance.*
*The chest still won&apos;t open, and you still don&apos;t know the magic word.*
*Ifan draws his weapon. His hands are steady, calm and controlled as can be.*
Please... please! I beg of you. You... you... you...!
Only one way to find out, isn&apos;t there.
Pox. Can&apos;t say I much want to carry it around, but Gershwin&apos;ll skin me.
*Decide that you want Samadel to join you in the battle. Her elemental skills could save lives.*
Come back later, then. I need a bit of time to carve up somethin&apos; useful.
I... I remember it was warm... there was smell... cinnamon... she took my uniform... I heard it crackling in a hearth...
Something about this doesn&apos;t smell right. Keep your eyes open.
Leave me be, brother. This traitor needs my attention.
The Red Prince came home a hero. Soon prince became emperor, and his armies marched on their neighbours. The Red Empire was born, and his House remained true to its name: there was never a day without war.
Follow Lohar&apos;s instructions.
I stand with you. Let&apos;s finish this.
*Say that you do, and take your leave.*
A Prize Kill
If you&apos;d asked me yesterday, I&apos;d have said they were the only ones left in the Divine Order worth their weight in salt. I have honoured their devotion to our lost Lucian.
*The indignity! How dare he pity you?*
Have to say, I&apos;m amazed I haven&apos;t &lt;i&gt;accidentally &lt;/i&gt;killed you yet... what with all the sneaking up on me.
&apos;tis a misfortune, sister. *Hack!* You lot can&apos;t help your condition, but at least the humans of ya ain&apos;t celebratin&apos; the Source plague!
*Examine the area around the skeleton.*
*Justinia&apos;s ears redden and her voice rises. She is still queen - and she would not have you forget it.*
So you eliminated the butcher responsible, I presume? You have earned your swagger, my good woman.
Hairstyle
*Psst.* Hey. You&apos;re a little light in yer pack there gorgeous, ain&apos;t ya? Who could blame you with the garbage they&apos;ve got fer sale around here.
*The spirit looks pleased, but no less confused, as tranquility enshrouds her.*
Can&apos;t say I&apos;m that surprised... angry? Oh yes. But not surprised...
If you tend to lose sight of characters in combat, activate the character outlines by hitting [IE_HighlightCharacters].
Pick a class preset if you want to dive in immediately with a balanced character, or customise if you want to tweak every detail to your heart&apos;s content.
That looks like a strange mushroom...
*Tell Beast you&apos;d return to the kingdom, be vigilant. Someone needs to keep Justinia in line.*
*Tell her you think she&apos;s pretty special too.*
Ah, the humans&apos; chief: Alexandar. A curious name, but no more bizarre than anything else that species does.
*And all of a sudden, it&apos;s over. The spirit disappears. All that remains is a vaguely unpleasant aura... and the feeling that there is more in this universe than you could ever possibly hope to understand.*
*She gives you a long look of approval. Then she raises a long-fingered hand and places it lightly upon your head. The pressure from her fingertips causes... pain. It tears at you.*
Ready when you are.
