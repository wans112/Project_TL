...unless you&apos;re a clam or something. Did you know that? Prying open a clam kills it? Poor thing.
So the great Magister city of Arx is in trouble? Seems fair to me.
*The first dial must be set.*
Mysterious Figure
With the living scar you see on my cheek, this horror that takes no more than a song sung by Master dearest to control my very thoughts.
What can I say? I&apos;m a popular girl. Hadn&apos;t even felt him hanging around in there. Well, we made short work of him. &lt;i&gt;Ha&lt;/i&gt;.
*Say that you know a lizard who&apos;s as distinctly red as she is.*
*Moan*
A fatal mistake. Say hello to Lucian for me.
If only Lucian were here...
*As Alexandar staggers back, blood streaming from his nose, Ifan tightens his grip on Alexandar&apos;s wrists and spits a question...*
*Get to the bottom of this Deathfog business. What is the Black Ring&apos;s end game?*
It was amazing - the kind of discovery on which a civilisation turns.
You don&apos;t know what this means to me. I&apos;ll send word to Magister Reimond right away. He should send for me soon enough.
She... I... you&apos;re correct! I feel her dark heart beat within my own no longer.
So this. This is how you repay me. After everything I&apos;ve done for you. You should have died in the Deathfog.
Cannot activate or deactivate skills in combat!
We are whole. Do you see? And soon we are many.
I... like to be alone now.
*You try to replace the bone extract - it doesn&apos;t seem to line up with the hole very well. You shove it in as best as you can and draw the scalp down over it.*
Hrrmm... fortunate for me, it seems. Let me return the favour...
*Say that Higba was greedy, but didn&apos;t seek to harm anyone - the cook must have sold him the contraband, in order to throw suspicion on him.*
*Say you met her not too long ago. The Magisters got to her, though...*
Klaud? Klaud...? Can you hear me?
*Duggan wraps his arms around her and pulls her close, whispering softly to her crown.*
*Tell her you don&apos;t care much about her sob story after all. Tell her to return your gold and you&apos;ll both be on your way.*
Haha! Open your &lt;i&gt;eyes. &lt;/i&gt;War, slavery, disease. Void, death, and the fall of a Divine. Do you suppose these happy accidents? His work is all around you. And you can consider me...
*Cowering is no solution. Ask what you must do to become the Divine.*
Listen, there are such things as courts of law; due process; judges and jurors, but these are all things that stand in the way of honest-to-goodness &lt;i&gt;justice&lt;/i&gt;.
What... what have you &lt;i&gt;done?&lt;/i&gt; Voidwoken!
The hens are dead or gone.
I will stand for Alexandar! I owe him... everything. If I die, at least I do so with a clear conscience.
A Sourceress, as it happens. A master of portals - and a lizard too. And there&apos;s naught wrong with that. Our snake-scaled Sourcerer seems unable to escape, but we can&apos;t get close enough to bring her down.
*Tell her that Arhu is dead - he was being held captive by her very own husband in the vault beneath their home.*
Snow
*You must find Roost. And have a chat.*
You may proceed.
*Browse her supplies.*
Atta gal! Who wouldn&apos;t?! Finally someone with a little sense around here.
Oh. It&apos;s you. Shouldn&apos;t you be... running and screaming or some such?
Leave me be, leave me be!
Poison Infusion Scroll
Here. This is a land of thieves - but coin is nothing.&lt;br&gt;
Silver Cup
*Try to open the hatch.*
Walking Corpse
More humans. Just what we needed.
Manifestation of Cruelty
Amyro was killed.
Paladin Tara Bree
Tutorial messages appear when new game concepts are introduced. If you are familiar with Divinity: Original Sin, you can choose to show only tutorial messages for new features.
&lt;i&gt;INTRUDER!&lt;/i&gt;
Growing
Don&apos;t you worry, though. She knows what&apos;s best for our people. And she&apos;ll do what&apos;s best for our people. She&apos;ll do what Lohar couldn&apos;t.
Portrait of a Woman
*Ask how you can help.*
You must stow your weapons.
Look at that.
Corrupted Blade
I salute you, monster-slayer.
*Offer your commiserations.*
Wasn&apos;t any &apos;we&apos; about it. Lucian licked &apos;em. And it killed him.
Kin should know better. More sign that we are lost without the Ancestor Trees.
Your loss, I suppose. Return if you want another taste of musical perfection!
*Say you&apos;d strongly advise against siding with some tyrannical tree.*
*Bow your head. Ask him what you must do.*
So, uh... can&apos;t you cut a guy a break and unbury me?
Stingtail mentioned a cook, as it happens: fellow named Griff. Two birds, one stone. How about it?
I tend to the more typical matters of the Cathedral: guiding those who visit us in their worship, and organising the feeding and housing of our brothers and sisters - Lord Arhu included.
*Ask about the small Voidwoken he spoke to. It seemed like an important conversation...*
*It doesn&apos;t budge.*
Still sniffing around? What do you want here, anyway?
[IFAN] *Tell the tiger you are not to blame. You lost loved ones in the Deathfog too.*
*Gareth bows his head out of respect, but only a few seconds pass before he breaks the silence.*
*A lizard in ritualistic garb keeps her vigil. Her eyes flicker upward to meet yours.*
*Slip the gem from around his neck. Place it in your pocket.*
...unless, uh, wait, what did you mean exactly?
*So, those assassins trying to kill the Red Prince... is he worried?*
High Quality Augmentor
Don&apos;t waste my time, Lohse. You&apos;re soon to become Adramahlihk&apos;s thrall; you ought to enjoy your last few moments of sentience doing whatever it is you like to do.
Dead Magister Priestess
No! No, it cannot be that you... that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; would harm our children; would harm &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
Medium Frost Rune Of Power
*The massive presence fades, but you aren&apos;t alone. A cold aura lingers nearby as the last ashes fall.*
*You think you can help it with its pain. Ask the dog to sit still.*
It matters to me! Now answer me - is the murderess alive or dead?!
You&apos;re just determined to stay in trouble, aren&apos;t you? Come on. A prison cell&apos;s waiting for you.
I am the rage that reigns, red cousin... I drain you dry... I make you pay... I WIPE AWAY THE STAIN...
*Say that you see memories. Childhood days spent in the sun.*
If we kill Dorian, Micheil Ros will match his price.
Please, my child, I am no Divine.
There&apos;s something about you, friend. Can&apos;t quite put my finger on it...
That doesn&apos;t rhyme, and you can thank me later.
But I can only give you the one bowl, lest I run out before all the pilgrims have had some supper.
*Ahem*
*The whiff of chemistry assails you. The spirit of the Widowmaker gives you the broadest hook of a smile. You have set him free. He&apos;s ready to depart...*
There is no good answer, indeed.
&lt;i&gt;GUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Well! &lt;/i&gt;Well, well, well...
You are about to leave for a higher level area. If you have unfinished business in Reaper&apos;s Coast, you should take care of it before venturing forth. Are you ready to leave?
Right, right. Sorry. Just hard not to see yeh as that wild-eyed troublemaker you used to be. It&apos;s been... what? Over a decade, yeah?
Magical Two-Handed Slicing Axe
Our business is done.
C&apos;mon! We were just getting started.
*Ask what&apos;s wrong with this young woman.*
Too long have you eluded the House of Shadows! You have killed the mother of dragons, but you didn&apos;t kill the dragons themselves! What was born in flame must perish in flame - as must you!
To arms, Lone Wolves! Battle on!
*Clear your throat and claim that you indeed bear a message from Braccus...*
Paulina Kemm&apos;s Wedding Ring
All we need to do is close our eyes and let *cough* sleep take us by the hand.
*Say you&apos;d have thought he&apos;s a Master of the Source himself.*
The bad man hurt me.
I&apos;ve no idea how long that&apos;ll take, but. Could happen any moment. Could take millennia.
When the crackdowns and decrees came, I defended her. When she exiled you, I joined in the applause. But this new plan of hers... I want to believe, I do. But... Deathfog? Something&apos;s not right, Marcus.
Levelling Up
Next Level [1]: +[2]% Critical Multiplier, +[3] Movement speed.
You cannot know. You may not know. You &lt;i&gt;shall not know&lt;/i&gt;.
Ah. One might be tempted to say fate lured you here, but the Divine is quite dead. There is no more fate but what we conjure.
I will always be an ally to those that carry Source, to those whose blood is of the heroes of old. And so, as always...
[Constitution Persuasion]
*With a sigh she turns away.*
*The crushing heat disappears, but the sharp change in temperature leaves you dizzy. A cold presence lingers nearby.*
Ooze Barrel
*You gasp as you are thrust into the present. You take a few deep heaves, then glance at the spirit. Her mouth continues to gabble, but you&apos;re grateful that only silence reaches your ears.*
&apos;Here lies an unknown farmhand.&lt;br&gt;Not a dwarf but of them.&lt;br&gt;&quot;A smallish man of no small heart.&quot;&apos;
&lt;i&gt;Men!&lt;/i&gt; To me... this common thief is threatening me!
Just because something is &lt;i&gt;bad &lt;/i&gt;doesn&apos;t mean you ought not to do it, love.
To Driftwood, then.
Can be resurrected.
Painting of the Council of Four
Reset
Toggle
Don&apos;t worry - as soon as she changes her tune, you&apos;ll know about it.
This sturdy staff appears to be carved from still-living wood; tender shoots and fresh green leaves bud along its length.
No! Wait. Surely... maybe... maybe some day they can be fixed... when all this Source nonsense is over.
These slimy rascals we can handle, but what happens when it&apos;s something with a bit more teeth to it?
Told you, didn&apos;t I? They crossed my wires. Hammer goes clang. And then the worms crawl in.
Hand Water Pump
Vile Burst
*Shrug and say that you were merely speculating.*
Equipment
Gettin&apos; it done, come hell or high water. Likely both, eh?
*Take your leave.*
You were? Atta boy! Like a swift kick in the Reds&apos; bollocks, that! You gladden an old dwarf&apos;s heart, fellow-me-lad! And even these rotten kippers smell the better for it!
To stop the God King, Dallis has to be found and the powers of Divinity reclaimed.
Void-tainted Sailfish
*Maybe later. Decide to take your leave.*
Did you come for the show, elf? Good timing. The interrogation scene is over, so we&apos;re almost at the climax!
Simple Bow
You&apos;ve been making quite the mess! Come on then. I&apos;ve got a prison waiting for you.
*Tell him you&apos;ll put the money to good use.*
*Whistle in amazement. Ask what else is going on.*
Thievery level too low
My painting... it&apos;s gone! You there - have your seen it?!
You won&apos;t take me! I&apos;ll see you in the Hall of Echoes!
On Source Orbs, Part 2
Fine. Be on your way. But I&apos;ve got my eye on you.
*Say that you found the sealed hatch nearby... is it safe to assume that he devised the security measures...?*
*Tell her you are a master, the Champion of Driftwood Arena.*
*Tell her that if she&apos;s serious, she ought to keep her wits about her.*
Tier [1] Rune
Yes?
A military-issue longbow crafted from simple yet functional materials and emblazoned with the insignia of a long-extinct regiment.
There is no separation, do you see? Human, dwarf, lizard - all one, all equal -
Please. I really need your help.
Sabotage Skillbook
Trousers of the Pilgrim
*Jonathan&apos;s face remains defiantly still.*
Anathema,&lt;i&gt; I&apos;m called, but only half&apos;s before you.&lt;br&gt;In archives rest the blade.&lt;br&gt;The path is marked; now on to isle embark.&lt;/i&gt;
