You&apos;ve been misinformed I think. I&apos;ve seen quite a few things on this island, but riches aren&apos;t one of them.
[SCHOLAR] *Respond that there&apos;s not empirical evidence that one species is consistently faster than the other... but you believe the answer here is &apos;false&apos;.*
*Say yes. It&apos;s been quite handy in keeping your information straight.*

Worms take you.
There must be some other, pulling the strings of these ghouls...

Well, this is awkward.
We found a bag of stolen property, but ours wasn&apos;t in it. Our things may be gone for good.
Hmm. Is that so?
Listen to Elodi.
*You heard that he&apos;s had some trouble with Voidwoken.*
[LOHSE] *Tell it the most obvious thing: You wish to be rid of the thing inside your head once and forevermore.*
Maybe they were shipped to Fort Joy.
It is so good to be among my people again. It is so good to be free.
*Hands up, tell her to calm down. You mean her no harm.*
*Remain quiet.*
Exploration Theme 14 Cello
*The world is a crudely woven tapestry, but you are an artisan beyond compare. You want - no, &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;- the finest craftsmanship.*
I can categorically state that a short, sharp shock with something of a magical persuasion would absolutely not solve my problem immediately.
Withermoore has promised to show us a way out of the Fort if we help him break his bonds.
Amyro claimed he could help us escape - but we&apos;d have to free him first.

*Stepping back from the spirit, the feeling of her panic starts to slowly fade from your mind.*
*Reach for the doorknob.*
I heard the thump of my beloved father-in-law&apos;s skull knocking against the floorboards upstairs. By now he&apos;ll be dead as the rest - but I need his will and I cannot be seen to go near the body.
Wish I could say the same...
*Matis rests upon the stool, humming a low song. He nods at you and continues humming.*
Enter your feedback
*Smile grimly. You know exactly what Voidwoken can do: you&apos;ve killed a few yourself.*
What&apos;s that amongst them, on top of the pillar...?
*You&apos;ve done as he asked. Insist he level with you on what&apos;s going on.*
We&apos;ll keep her distracted while you get close. Go on then, if you&apos;re going.
Gor-Gor
Hired Terramancer
Hands out of my pockets!
*Warn her to cool it. The state of Lord Arhu&apos;s chambers has nothing to do with you.*
If you happen across our reinforcements, be sure to tell them to hurry up.
I have waited centuries! Watching lives come and go, while my soul lies locked in a cage!
Roost... He&apos;s the one who abducted me - delivered me to the Master. I&apos;m going to find that man, and we&apos;re going to get mightily reacquainted.
*Tell him they can take whatever they want from you, including your spirit. Buyer beware, though.*
I don&apos;t fancy repeating myself, so let this be the last time!
I wonder what I would have done in his place.
THOU ART... &lt;i&gt;SWORN TO THE ONE WHO MUST NOT BE.&lt;/i&gt;
With spiritual aid, we&apos;ve defeated the Devourer.
Really? It&apos;s all I can think about. Us. Alone. No guidance. No protection. And the Voidwoken... there&apos;s more by the day...
That so? Maybe you aren&apos;t who I thought you were, then.
Its blade patterned with nicks and scratches, this hefty gut-piercer is an excellent sidekick for bartering, threatening or general intimidation.

*Question his tone. He is still your lesser, and he mustn&apos;t forget it.*
*Squint. What the hell is she talking about?*
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;push you. I want only bread.
*Lohse&apos;s eyes flash eagerly. She turns from Jahan, renewed enthusiasm in every step.*
Marvellous. Great things abound in our future, I&apos;m sure.
*Nod and say you&apos;ll let her know if you hear anything interesting.*
You woke up and your world was gone. The last of your kind, you hide behind a charmed mask, searching for the truth about a history that no-one knew existed.
*You recall Nior. House of War. Never is a man more vulnerable than when he lies in bed expecting a kiss instead of a kidney dagger.*
Your lies end here. Get her!
He&apos;s a deviant named Higba, a grubby little tinkerer with a criminal mind. Some of my Magisters have vanished from Driftwood lately, and I&apos;m certain that fiend is responsible!
Paladin Apprentice
I wanted to help you: teach you to become a demon killer like I am, so that you could cut away the leech that suckles from your soul. How vain was my hope.
You&apos;re nothing but a raving pyromaniac! Keep away from me!

*The arm divides the sands like a macabre waypost.*
Good news, at least for now. I thank you for your kindness. Shall we pray together?
*Run away.*
You&apos;re gonna need to blow this pop-weed stand if ya want t&apos;stop her, but maybe this&apos;ll help.
Hello, Jahan. How nice of you to invite me to the party.
But I have a solution. You. You are my Godwoken. My replacement.
You were on that luckless lot of timber that met with one tentacle too many, weren&apos;t you? Yes, I remember your asking me about my dice...
Veeeeeery generous, and veeeeeeery fair. Seeeeeeee you then! Haha!
[Translate49_f51fc195-f146-4605-ab1a-db3fdc15077a]
I guess so. I just can&apos;t help but wonder if there&apos;s something more... real behind it all. More &lt;i&gt;me. Just &lt;/i&gt;me.
*Say that whatever happens, a change can only lead to greater good.*
*Remark that the Magisters seem to have set fire to their own building in an effort to destroy evidence - hardly sophisticated encryption...*
Oh really now? Well, well, well. I guess this makes us MORTAL ENEMIES. For now, at least. *Winks*.
Our Scion falls - we mourn. Go no further.

Oh, I don&apos;t know. She was a sweet soul. Quiet. Loved her family. Always seemed strong, as I recall, but she didn&apos;t come across as no fearless military leader back then. She was just a girl.
Hi there. Bye then.

All we&apos;re saying is don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest. Or &apos;ad things&apos;ll ha&apos;en. Ex&apos;loding things.
But I&apos;m a... a roadside inn. Red door, flowers out front, friendly lady at the door beckoning you in for half price.

*Ask what Roost Anlon and the Lone Wolves wanted with her daughter.*
Come one. I&apos;ve got young&apos;uns to think about!
*Ask what happened to Jahan.*

[FANE] *Wave your hand dismissively. It is nothing, Amadia just... reminds you of someone.*
*Gareth shakes his head at the unconscious Magister lying at his feet.*
I&apos;m a Magister alright. Well... I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;. But yeah. Dwarf Magisters&apos;re as rare as a three-eyed imp, but when you&apos;re hard up... well, sometimes you gotta make choices.
The love of my life. Griet. She passed in the night - something in the stomach. Doctor couldn&apos;t help her.
Withermoore
Why, the Undead of course. We rise, we &lt;i&gt;rise&lt;/i&gt;. There is a stirring, have you not felt the whisper of the grave upon the winds?
*Tell her you&apos;re just glad to have survived this entire ordeal. The realm will cope with these changes as it must.*
You should go.
A bow with a guitar snare for a string.
It is as though Tir-Cendelius himself forgets us. There is no fate for us.
[BARBARIAN] *Eye the lizard suspiciously. He&apos;s got lots of long words, but you&apos;re short on patience. Speak plain!*
Don&apos;t make this harder than it has to be. We&apos;re on different sides now.
Hannag,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is our &lt;i&gt;third&lt;/i&gt; communique!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again: we recovered the Deathfog Delivery Device you made to Farzanah&apos;s instructions, but we need your expertise to repair and attune it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;substantial&lt;/i&gt; sum of our war chest has been set aside for your aid in this endeavour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weâ€™ve been sending missives to you at The Blackpits but we understand you are in Driftwood Fields presently, hopefully on your way here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We really need you to hurry and hope this letter finds y...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[The rest of the letter is covered in a quite sizable inkblot.]&lt;/i&gt;
[ELF-FRIEND] *Offer a prayer to Tir-Cendelius for the repose of the soul of Sarias.*
Mmm. A clever question, that is not.
*The cat stands up, wobbles, then sits back down.*
...they know the past so future may be bright.
*Leave the dragon behind.*
[JESTER] *Tell her it&apos;s a cat-has-trophy.*
*Tell her to relax. She&apos;s no reason to apologise.*
That means there is but one place we can go: the Well of Ascension.
Small Chest
We were told to register with Magister William at the other end of the ship.
*Grimace at the towering monstrosity, and prepare for battle...*
Look at you. Beautiful inside and out.
An ancient metal-plated belt with an ostentatious W etched deeply on the buckle. Not exactly the latest style, but it&apos;ll hold your pants up.
*Braccus Rex - evil incarnate! Reach for your weapon; you cannot let him live!*
No entry. So scram.
You can&apos;t hide who you are, killer! LOOK! Look at him, it&apos;s him! It&apos;s the Silver Claw himself... Ifan ben-Mezd!
*The music swells as the spirit&apos;s dalliances along the piano keys are joined by a ghostly violin. A distant orchestra fills the room with melody.*
There is a handwritten inscription at the start of this weighty tome. It boasts that even the feckless ones who only flick through the pages within are permanently improved. Only one way to find out...

Mmmm... is my shift over? Are you here to relieve me?&lt;br&gt;
*Reach out to touch the device she is tinkering with.*
Don&apos;t... I&apos;m so hungry.
*Shake your head. The dead had their time already. Now is the time for the living.*
*Ask what has this caravan stranded.*
&apos;Here lies Withermoore the Cold-Hearted.&apos;
The Doctor still lives... I can sense his presence - he corrupts the very air around us. Kill him, &lt;i&gt;please, &lt;/i&gt;or more will suffer as I did.
Looking fresh from some hellish abattoir, it&apos;s hard to imagine that this partially-dismembered torso was once a walking, talking, thinking being. Just like you.
*Your hand falls from the jar, your bones prickling and cold after the vision. To die down here would be a terrible. To live down here for eternity...  you shudder at the thought.*
Good. You did well. These Seekers were blind without their leader, but you returned their one-eyed king.
*He turns away as you leave. It seems he&apos;s forgotten the dagger you still carry in your hand.*
*Grunt!*
Find the blueprints for the building! There may be hidden chambers.
