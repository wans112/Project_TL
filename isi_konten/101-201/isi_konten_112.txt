*Keep circling with your thumb. You have time.*
Get an eyeful, your holiness. I expect it&apos;s the last we&apos;ll see of each other for some time.
*His face breaks into a grin, scaled features crinkled in mirth.*
It&apos;s the best approach in a city teeming with the faithful. Pilgrims, revelers... with every one of their cheers and prayers, they draw wicked eyes. In Arx, strength is found only in silence.
Outside the bones are gnashing. In here the Magisters are... are cutting, slicing, grinding, smashing...
I think about superstition a lot. A &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt;. You&apos;d be QUITE amazed how much thinking you can get done in &lt;i&gt;millennia&lt;/i&gt; of imprisonment. P-p-praise the - the Seven, right? - praise the Seven that&apos;s all over.
I&apos;ll never forget you... whatsyername.
Target is too close!
Maaaaaaad! HA HA HA, &lt;i&gt;YESSSSSSS!!&lt;/i&gt;

What could that have done?
*Eyes closed, the tiger seems to be... &lt;i&gt;praying.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Gratiana? Show her the jar with her name on it and ask what she knows about it.*
No, no. Forget it. I shouldn&apos;t have said anything. Please, do excuse me. I&apos;ve got... preparations to make.
*The stone relic pulls on your consciousness. You feel the tendrils of an ancient hunger trespassing within your soul, seeking something. Something you have. &lt;i&gt;Source.*&lt;/i&gt;
Original Price: [1]
Perhaps I should demand the same from those red-cloaked humans. They laid their hands on me more than once...

Elven Treewarden
New-forged Amulet
Oh aye - forgot your lot still keep slaves. Yer empire&apos;s rotten as this catch. But the boss found a buyer for this muck, so maybe there&apos;s hope for you yet.

*Before you can strike a blow, Daeyena snaps rigid. A voice booms from the helm.*
Here, this is the elven fare - try it for yourself. You&apos;ll see that you&apos;re missing nothing special.
Tome on the Godslayer
*Ready your weapon.*
*Looking closer, you recognise the device she works on. It is &lt;i&gt;identical &lt;/i&gt;to the portal you were given to save the elves... right before the Deathfog annihilated them.*
Wiping out the Black Ring with a side order of elves in the last war. Don&apos;t mess with the Divine Order, ha!
*There&apos;s nothing in the spirit but pain - its own and that of its captive. He resists the agony, but it&apos;s only a matter of time before the spirits tear his Source away. The pain begins to hurt you too.*
Masterful Assassin
&quot;Fate is driving the Red Prince to this ill-fated city. He must know I am here. He must know I&apos;ll await him, hidden deep within the sanctuary of dreams. He must find me, so that we may unite and fulfil the prophecy that binds us.&quot;
*Ask why this jar has her name inscribed on it.*
Queen Justinia&apos;s orders, of course! Can&apos;t really say more than that to you.
Well, I... I didn&apos;t mean... Obviously... Look, serves &apos;em right for shelterin&apos; Sourcerers.
Red Noxious Bulb
I am. I was. But our kind are practical; we are fair. When a link the chain is weak, we take action.
Now I must do the job for which you were made.

Look who&apos;s come to join the party!
Fill up on tales lived by cultures past...
A tattered ribbon loops twice around this key, bearing a small sewn label that reads &apos;Gathering Room&apos;  in Ancient Empire script.
Game Master Lobby
Royal Amulet
*Nod your assent. For now.*
My master empowered me to treat with your kind, and have you rid this isle of Black Ring filth. In return, I was to grant something of great value to you...
Never mind. If you need to suit up, I can offer you a fair price. If not, I would thank you to move on.
The King soon comes to claim my spirit.

It&apos;s a terrific waste. Still, without the proper tool to remove the face from a corpse, I cannot take advantage of the many cadavers you&apos;re providing.
Fuligin black and so dense you can feel it tugging at the tendrils of all life and energy surrounding it.
Stay near me. You don&apos;t want to get lost, where we&apos;re going.
That&apos;s it. You&apos;ll pay for your arrogance!

Electrified Steam
Let me show you. I had a spot, near the... the place where they buried the otherssh. I hope there&apos;s somefink there you can use.
Cleric
The fount requires a... fresh offering. I upheld my part of the bargain and kept my teeth out of your so-called &lt;i&gt;innocents&lt;/i&gt;. You can&apos;t spare a little blood to save another precious life?
You might say I&apos;ve a soft spot for royals who dabble with demons.
But before you begin, a word of warning. I gather that you travel with a pack of others?

Nice poem. Kinda wasted on humans though.
Surely you&apos;ve accomplished &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; of note.
*What&apos;s done is done. Leave Ifan be.*
Wares
That&apos;s right. Move along. Nothing to see here.

[OUTLAW] *Tap your dagger and say you&apos;d rather buy directly from her source.*

Elvish elders consider twisted and bound wood to hold the greatest potential power within.
*Refer to the Source amulet Arhu mentioned. Only the Keeper could have known about it.*
[RED PRINCE] *You spot a mark on the side of the figurehead - it&apos;s a living scar, like the elven slaves had back home.*

I saw what you did, you fiend! I will teach you &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;, hear me?!
Don&apos;t make much of it one way or the other. But the farther we get away from the Joy, the better.
Those Black Ring dogs. They took the universe. &lt;i&gt;But they don&apos;t know what it is!&lt;/i&gt;
I am not sorry...
Yes, yes. You have already offered your condolences.
Potent solvent blast, wiping out nearby surfaces.
I know who you are. I know what you want. You will not get it. &lt;i&gt;For you are nothing. Nothing! GET OUT!&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm... quite sensible of you, to admit when you&apos;re outclassed. You&apos;d be amazed how few people think to study their surroundings for clues about...
*Tell it that property is a lie - there is no such thing as theft.*
Loyal
But I will see myself destroyed rather than be forced to betray you again, I swear.
*Thank the door and take your leave.*
Lovrik&apos;s Lizard Lover
The Magisters found something called &apos;The Aeteran&apos;. They seem to be in a hurry to send it to Dallis. It must be important.

That is our business. I thank you for honouring Sarias. But perhaps it is best if you move on.
Source Hound Phyllip
...they know the past so future may be bright.

Hold on there, lad.
Got that right! It&apos;s a new dawn and a new order! Out with Source, out with Void and in with the days of Dallis! Hurrah!
*He grins, and holds his hand towards you. You feel yourself... change. You feel a new self rising...*
You cannot stop us now. Evil will not prevail today.
I guess you really &lt;i&gt;can &lt;/i&gt;get anything in prison.
So you&apos;ll lead our next assault?
*Refuse the God King&apos;s covenant.*
Oh, Lohse. I understand people all too well. That&apos;s how I know that, when the time comes, you&apos;ll do what you need to do.
&apos;sides, wouldn&apos;t expect you to understand. I got a&lt;i&gt; code,&lt;/i&gt; you know.
Stand
She left as you did your work here. I did not ask questions.
And what kind of Divine was Ifan ben-Mezd as the world battled the demons?
