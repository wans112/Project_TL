What - you thought I might just hang around here until that madman finds a fleshy place to stick his dagger? Fat chance of that.

*She is stock-still, waxy-skinned, her eyes dark. Greyish-black veins run from her eyes down her cheeks.*
An&apos; got you a tail! That&apos;s disgusting!
*Share the contents of Dorian&apos;s diary. He only married Isla for the money.*
I know we&apos;ll all meet again some day. I just wish it could be sooner.
Go on. Round up the whole team. I need to have my way with all of you before we can leave.
*He takes a step backwards. Throws a sultry look at you.*
These creatures are so prone to violence. Naturally, the weaker specimens suffer.

Madam, now that I can count you among their number, I should never find fault with them again!

Well if it ain&apos;t the Beast o&apos; the Sea! I&apos;ll be. Shouldn&apos;t you be off yo-ho-ho&apos;ing on your ship &apos;stead of stowin&apos; away on this one?

You... How dare you interfere?!
Loyalty is cheap these days. Seems the Black Ring could buy it wholesale, if they have the coin.
As good as I&apos;m gonna get.
*And with that, he&apos;s laughing uncontrollably again, waving you away with both hands.*
*Ask what she and her people are doing here.*
Aww. The big lizard&apos;s as weak as a kitten. There there. It&apos;ll be okay.
Spoke to the lady captain, didn&apos;t ye? I seen ye, cosying up. Are ye hers, ye bag of bones, or sail ye with us?
I don&apos;t want to be lauded. If word spreads of what I&apos;ve done... the Magisters will swarm all over me in an instant...
Lord Ruaney&apos;s Boots
Almost a pity you weren&apos;t a witness actually, for you would have seen the conception of a new world!
What&apos;s this, woman? I know a bomb when I see it. OUT WITH IT.
*Say you&apos;re here for a way off the island; nothing more.*
Get out of here, Sebille. I can&apos;t be seen with you. I&apos;m... sorry.
*Ask him if he has any special skills. If he&apos;s useful, he could join you aboard your ship, the Lady Vengeance.*
*Thank him for the warning.*
We learned that a group of dissident Magisters called the Seekers are helping Sourcerers to escape - we should try to find them.
Speak with Griff.

The Dragon Knight Slane destroyed the Shriekers by the shore. The way is clear!
Loadin&apos; and unloadin&apos;, that&apos;s been the way for it for so long that one day bleeds to the next. Last I remember, we&apos;d locked up that Mordus fella and, Duna willin&apos;, threw out the key.

Eh? What? Dunno whatcha mean.
Focus not on death and irony, Sebille: on life and ascension instead.
Enter through the portside door.
There was a couple staying in my place. Young folks, sweet folks, hiding from the Reds. But then came the end... I wonder if they made it... I wonder if they made it...
We&apos;ve found a cavern bristling with Magister traps.

He&apos;s close! We must turn back now, or he&apos;ll have me under his thrall once more.
You have my thanks, monster-killer. We need all the help we can get.

I wish I had some sort of reward I could give you, but alas...

Oh my &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, look who it is! Our brand new lord and saviour.
I don&apos;t give a rat&apos;s arse what they say downstairs - the Magisters is all that stands between us and the Voidwoken. We should be grateful!
Or octopuses! Did you know they&apos;re secretly pl-...
Do you know who you are, Godwoken? Do you know what you seek?
I spoke words in haste, but let us not part as enemies. Let us instead deepen our alliance. What say you?

I was never very fond of that verse actually. But tell me, how would &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; like to be remembered? As a hero or a lover?
Elemental Havoc (Earth)
*Your hand reaches through her. As you pull back, a shiver overtakes you and a cloud descends. You see through the woman&apos;s eyes. You feel the discomfort of a Source collar as you tug at it.*
Your gold can&apos;t save you, not against blades...
*Think better of taking her hand and stand away from her.*
Tell me, please: did you see signs of battle? Of my Magister brothers and sisters?
*Ask the spirit what happened here.*
*Say you never were one to trust a Magister.*
*The goddess carries a strange expression, one of expectation mixed with... sorrow.*
Higba trusts us to help him escape. There&apos;s an opportunity here...
*Inspect the bloodstains.*
Hold there, elf! I answered your question, but you did not answer mine.
The Doctor began to chant his possession spell.
There isn&apos;t any chance you could spare a moment to help me look, could you? I wouldn&apos;t dare ask if it it weren&apos;t terribly important.

*Nod. You&apos;re a Lone Wolf, you travel alone.*
*Say you&apos;re interested in someone with a little muscle. Ask if he has any martial experience.*
I admit, it&apos;s hard to crack a joke these days. After all, what could be funnier than Gods cowering inside their subjects? Well - I do have &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; idea...
And what kind of Divine was Marcus Miles,
In the meantime though, let us continue our search for a Dreamer. The search in Fort Joy proved to be less than fruitful.
*She holds your face, eyes soft and heavy.*

I- I suppose you deserve to know. Before I knew Amadia&apos;s grace, I was a very different person. I was the concubine of Braccus Rex.
I set my course far on the map...
