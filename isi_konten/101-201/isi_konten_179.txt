*Tarquin turns away but continues to mutter excitedly, almost religiously, about Anathema.*
Antivenom Dome
Custom-Fit Wizard&apos;s Robe
Ancient Forge
Be wary. The child must not walk free!
The Mother Tree is dead.
Void Crystal
*You lie in the darkness and join them.*
*The sculpture is covered in strange glyphs. The only visible ornament is a deep-set stone that emits a gentle glow.*
Don&apos;t mind us. Just patchin&apos; up before we head home. Gonna put a few reinforcements around the place, in case a few more of those Void-bugs show up again.
Remember email address for session
The dwarves&apos; royal seal? It couldn&apos;t be...
Your next words will decide the heights to which I will take your pain. &lt;i&gt;Make them good.&lt;/i&gt;
*Try to take your leave while the leaving&apos;s good.*
Oh goodie! You&apos;re a good long tree-like human. Yes you are! Who&apos;s a good long tree-like, then? You! That&apos;s who! Would you like me to widdle on your leg?
Buy me a drink and I&apos;ll think about it.
*The spirit freezes, somehow sensing that this is the end. She closes her eyes.*
It ain&apos;t right, promising bones they&apos;ll live again. It ain&apos;t the way of things.
Official Proclamation
We found an encrypted hatch in the barracks.
*As your fingertips graze the cold urn, memories dance across your mind.*
*It bites down, hard enough to crush bone. When you yank your arm back out, it&apos;s covered in marks from massive fangs.*
*Grimace at her. So she stole from you just to get a quick fix of Drudanae...*
*Wish him good luck.*
*Quick as a flash, the Magister has an arrow notched on his raised bow. He falters - a glimmer of recognition crosses his face... followed a moment later by a wry smile.*
*He&apos;s exposed. Consume his Source. Take it all.*
Help... me...
Wreckers&apos; Cave - Reaper&apos;s Cove
Manage
*Tell him the process might be a little... unpleasant. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
*Lay your hand on the relic.*
*He reaches towards you to take a card, and...*
- PECKER!
The Black Ring risked much to prise secrets from an Ancestor Tree.
Reflexes
*Tell her you&apos;ve never really thought about it.*
*Once, this was a courthouse. Or a guardhouse. Or an outhouse.*
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Very well. Go, in service of the God King...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*The cat emits a flimsy meow and begins to hack, but fails to spit up a hairball.*
Delicious. But every grape you eat now is a mouthful of wine stolen from your future self, so hide the stalks.
[JESTER] *Laugh and say he&apos;s quite the devoted botanist.*
Bring the evidence to the authorities.
I don&apos;t want to stay here longer than we have to.
Genocide
The Disciple&apos;s Leg Armour
*Tell him to take his proposition elsewhere.*
*Tell the kid to go find his parents.*
Cherish this purest of pearls I have given you: a droplet of untainted Source, and a promise of things to come.
I found a thief!
We left the island without exploring the armoury.
*Suddenly, you&apos;re on this very ship, crouched in a corner, hugging your knees. A figure approaches - an older woman. Her eyes are kind. She comes closer; she says she wants to talk.*
Character is very vulnerable to elemental damage.
*Stand back and let them catch up.*
*Ifan stands steadfast beside you, drawing his weapon slowly and aiming at the Doctor.*
*He &apos;enchanted&apos; a dead cat? Say that it sounds like necromancy to you.*
*Demand to know what the voice wants from you.*
&lt;i&gt;Yyyyyeeeeesssss.&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm. Fine. I don&apos;t hold it against you this time. Not sure I am so generous if it happens again.
*Approach her and ask what has her so enamoured with that lizard.*
The Shadow Prince told us of Sadha, the Red Princess. Her union with the Red Prince will beget dragons.
*Say that you&apos;re eager to return home at last.*
Pike
*A harsh, rattling laugh.*
*Nod with appreciation and say that his work seems to be &lt;i&gt;most &lt;/i&gt;skillful. You could never hope to overcome it.*
Quercus is ready.
Squire Parry
*Growl!* You&apos;re a very! Long! Stick! Be good! Bark!
Meet your new companion!
*Ask what her name is.*
Greatness is often thrust on us, unbidden.
Don&apos;t let their less-than-inviting appearance mislead you. Just like the slithering worm feeds the high-soaring bird, the abundance of Source in these demons can expand your own.
You can fake an etching, no problem. I&apos;m telling you, he wouldn&apos;t&apos;a done it!
*Nothing compares to your own fantastic deeds! Share with her your story so far.*
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; brought the Eternals back to the world, and saw the God King enslave the thieves.
Hazardous concoction vessels generated!
Bless you.
[VILLAIN] *Tell him he&apos;s cruel &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;clever. Give him your compliments.*
I&apos;ve dreamed of this moment so often. You can&apos;t even imagine... my thoughts are always, always consumed by you: your smile, your spirit, your &lt;i&gt;soul&lt;/i&gt;.
We can! Pretty soon we&apos;ll lick &apos;em, same as we did the Black Ring.
Please! Stop that! I&apos;m quite defenceless here.
Can&apos;t... breathe...
An undead, eh? Why, this vessel truly attracts &lt;i&gt;all sorts&lt;/i&gt;...
Makeshift Axe
*You tried to make a break for it, from Fort Joy to the beach. You didn&apos;t make it. You died to the sound of your own echoing screams as the Voidwoken gnawed your bones.*
*Tell him to get out of town.*
A medium-sized potion that enchants and strengthens your Physical Armour.
Ryker is dead.
I won&apos;t ask. Long as it weren&apos;t a Voidwoken, that&apos;s all I need to know.
Bloody STUPID... bleeding IDIOTIC... &lt;i&gt;I&apos;LL SHOW YOU!&lt;/i&gt;
I do not care.
You SHUT that filthy gash in yer face afore I cut it right off ya!
[SCHOLAR] *State that every culture through history has established its own code of ethics. Within those codes, right and wrong are strongly defined.*
*Tell them their charity is all well and good, but they&apos;ve done terribly wrong. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;seek to reverse the damage - if they can help you further, they should.*
as
The right decision is often the hardest to make. You should&apos;ve made it anyway.
This is acceptable. You have proven cleverness that has eluded Driftwood&apos;s... well, I won&apos;t say &apos;great minds&apos;. But... &apos;minds&apos;, at least. So tell me...
But of course. You&apos;re Godwoken, after all; to ascend is your birthright. And now that you and I are joined, it&apos;s mine too.
That&apos;s one. Who else do you want to join you?
The Mother is dead and we are free.
The Doctor says you&apos;re beholden to evil. The Doctor says you&apos;re too sick to be healed. The Doctor would prefer that you die.
Couldn&apos;t add custom image. The file is probably corrupted. If you&apos;re trying to add a JPEG-image, try to open it in an image editor (for instance Paint) and re-save as a JPEG.
*The tallest, strongest elf, whom you take to be the leader, considers you for a moment. She seems to give you the benefit of the doubt, and turns back to the task in hand.*
Naptooth
Yes, he pestered me for aid. When I finally told him about a cache of Braccus&apos;s soulforged weapons hidden in the marsh, he rushed away to find it.
*Order the facts: They harboured a Sourcerer, who brought down Voidwoken upon their farm?*
*Tell Gareth the Seekers should move forward in spite of the Shriekers.*
*Ask if he knows where the Sallow Man is.*
|Short Temper|
Here, take one of my eggs and engulf it with fire. Do so, and a dragon will be born, ready even now to fight by your side!
Come here, you.
*Say that Cat the Appraiser wants to get his artefacts.*
To see an &lt;i&gt;elf &lt;/i&gt;burning the body of kin. It turns one&apos;s stomach...
*Consume the spirit bull&apos;s Source.*
Fish Bucket
Yes. You could.
Talk to the girl.
Of course he did! Like he was bid to - by a Master; by a higher force than he!
We killed the Eternal.
Squeak, squeak. It smells faintly of stale dog&apos;s breath.
*Leave her to her grief.*
*A massive man looms over the desk, his hair a tangle of matted knots. Scars upon scars cross every inch of visible flesh, from his hands to his gnarled face.*
Once this was a place of holy learning.
Adventure Missing
*Tir-Cendelius grimaces with disdain.*
Decaying Mound
*The Meistr grabs your sleeve and pulls you down until you are inches from her bloodied, glittering eyes.*
*Tell him he&apos;ll pay for what he has done.*
Silver Cup
Don&apos;t just vanish like that - I was talking to you!
*You hear its whispers. &lt;i&gt;&apos;I see what&apos;s inside you.&apos; &lt;/i&gt;And then it is gone.*
*Tell him he can&apos;t judge a book by its dirty, bloodstained cover.*
Spider Legs
What is this? Pickpocketed. Curses!
Item Added: Iron Ore
*The Magister narrows his eyes, searching your form for any sign of treachery.*
There is a safe place.
Godsdammit. We need to get off this wreck, and quick.
*Hold her chin in your hand. Give her one last kiss. Walk away.*
*Say you make it your business to investigate the local goings-on. That&apos;s all.*
*Wonder if he can give you any insight into Dallis, following his time in her captivity.*
When the demons start frettin&apos;, you know you shoulda started frettin&apos; &lt;i&gt;yesterday&lt;/i&gt;.
Squirrel
Forget about them. They&apos;re the relics of a bygone age. They&apos;ll return to the dust they conjured themselves from.
Gareth is reluctant to attack the Magisters without the means to defeat the Shriekers that guard the approaches to the harbour. We should investigate on how to defeat such creatures.
We were at a wedding. Event of the season, over at Micheil Ros&apos; estate. We were meant to be there to... represent our boss.  Duna rest &apos;im.
*Say she&apos;s not exactly your type.*
Ah! Well I&apos;m very glad to hear it. I can&apos;t help but feel bad for children these days... it&apos;s a hell of a world they&apos;ll be inheriting from us.
*Fire runs through your veins, licking at every nerve in your body. Every movement from him sparks a charge, like chain lightning in a storm.*
*Sigh and nod towards the cave&apos;s mouth. He&apos;s free to go.*
Like yourself, maybe? *Winks.* I don&apos;t mind the kiddies. Usually.
Dagmare&apos;s Amulet
*Try to find a joint and remove it piece-by-piece.*
Don&apos;t underestimate the power of true prayer! This is a place of incredible power, where a single prayer holds the weight of thousands. Your heart and soul will fill as quickly as they&apos;re drained.
I must admit - I always wanted to give her a good whack.&lt;br&gt;
We&apos;ve been here centuries, our Source sealed away. We&apos;re not about to let you lock that door again.
This is your skill screen. If you want to learn more skills, you need to find or buy &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;skillbooks&lt;/font&gt;. Skills belong to various categories or skill schools. To be able to learn skills from other schools, you need to invest Ability Points in them.
*Pavlonia gazes searchingly around the floor near her, muttering to herself.*
The Devourer&apos;s Heart
Yes, anything! He weren&apos;t meant to bloody wear it!
*Consider his offer. How do you know you can trust him?*
The Lone Wolves were tasked with killing Godwoken. So if we want to find out who&apos;s hunting &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;, we&apos;ll need to track down my old pack to get some answers.
*He tips you a salute and walks on.*
*And then at last you see him murdered in cold blood as the Magisters left the cave, their work here finished, his services no longer required, his wages paid with his own soul, which he was allowed to keep.*
*Suddenly, it&apos;s gone again. She winks, and you&apos;re left wondering whether you saw anything at all.*
Xiuh had hoped to keep his master&apos;s secrets until the end of time, but it is right that a kin of your majesty should know.
*Laugh and apologise. You&apos;ll turn it down a few notches.*
Dominator
The curse is lifted! Thank you, stranger!
