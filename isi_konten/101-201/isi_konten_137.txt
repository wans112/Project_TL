Elodi is dead. After we saved her from the bullies at the front gate... I&apos;d hoped she wouldn&apos;t be returning her memories to the soil just yet.
A little dose of drudanae will kill your pain. A bigger dose&apos;ll kill your mind.
We&apos;re lucky that elf don&apos;t creep up here too often. Them that&apos;s resting down below, though?
*The dog gives you a doleful look, then turns away.*
Oh, sweet thing. If you think I&apos;ll spill the tale just &apos;cause you asked pretty, you&apos;ll be disappointed in this life and the next.
&lt;i&gt;Why do you come? We have a vessel-&lt;/i&gt;husk &lt;i&gt;already.&lt;/i&gt;
Hmph.
Be quick about it, before the next Magister patrol realises something is amiss
*Say you&apos;re pretty sure he&apos;s not the gardener.*
Bah, fine, if it&apos;ll get you out of me hair: the name&apos;s Warron. Now, how&apos;s about you scarper?
Ha!
I was just thinking about someone I used to know. My cousin. The queen, in fact. A tyrant.
Only Rhalic&apos;s most faithful may carry us to the Hall.
Thirst... Dry throats... Drink... Water... Water...
*Say that it doesn&apos;t bother you one bit. The man helped enslave her after all.*
*The spirit doesn&apos;t acknowledge you. He just desperately scans his target, raising his aim higher... he fires - no effect.*
*Giggles* Yes yes! Here. Take it. Just leave me be, darling. Just leave me be.
[SEBILLE] *Tell the crab you won&apos;t be collared very long. The shackles haven&apos;t been made that can hold you.*
I make arrangements. I travel soon. I must meet... someone who can help us. I say no more than this.
A ship...?
*The royal protector sighs, but barely looks up from the floorboards.*
A sword made in the signature style of Vernivian warriors, nicknamed &apos;Soldier&apos;s Paramour&apos; by those left behind by war.
The terms of conditions of an assassination agreement. Target: to be determined.
*Nod. You promise.*
You have time for a little story, then? With nobody here but us stuck flies, let me spin you a tale...
[IFAN] *Slowly, and through clenched teeth, ask: &lt;i&gt;&apos;What? The? Hell?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Lie and say yes, you&apos;re meant to go with them.*
Proud to&apos;ve met you...
*Listen to the wisdom of summer.*
[IFAN] *Yes. But you&apos;re reserving the right to be at least a little evil.*
Fantastic. Now, on to the interesting part.
The Waylaid Knight
That little snob thinks me unworthy of being in his precious lord&apos;s mansion appraising his precious lord&apos;s collection of antiques.
&lt;i&gt;Ugh.&lt;/i&gt;
*Be on your way.*
Okay then, thanks. I&apos;ll have it.
*Ask about how all this unfolded.*
[FANE] *Quietly tell him that you are simply someone who knows the pain of confinement.*
I&apos;d better thaw this place or else get out while I still can...
*Shake your head. Tell her you don&apos;t bow. It&apos;s not your thing.*
*Give her a wink. If she lets you in, you&apos;ll have this demon under your spell in no time.*
Escape Fort Joy.
Spirit of Exter
Verdistis Necklace
That may be, but is she alone? Is she afraid? Who&apos;s there to look after the lass? There&apos;s so much I don&apos;t know. So much that scares me...
Please. You gotta stop him. He &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t!&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrink back.*
I... I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re going to accuse me of killing the mood, but the thing is, I need to talk to you about the Master.
*The tension eases out from the cat&apos;s skeletal form. It sits.*
Don&apos;t go any further, Godwoken. We need you alive.
*Address the undead. Who are you speaking to?*
*Embrace him.*
Attacking a child? That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;dark. &lt;/i&gt;And... very bad for your sense of self that must be. So let me help you. I&apos;m not actually a little boy...
Ha. I admire your pride. And ours is a hardy race, to be sure. But when great powers such as these are at play, we can&apos;t rely on either pride or hardiness to save us.
This, my friend, is the key. Give me some time, and every deity in existence will tremble at the sight of you.
Blessed Poison Cloud
Don&apos;t be coy now.
*Ask about Isbeil. Who was she? What was her role?*
*Look into his eyes. Look into his &lt;i&gt;past.*&lt;/i&gt;
Fane and I went below decks together. Once we were alone, he revealed who he really was and shared his innermost self with me. It was amazing, I couldn&apos;t have been happier.
*You look her in the eye. She&apos;s trying not to cry.*
*In the pit beyond, things move once more, as if returning to their original position. Then the mechanism rests. Behind you the sound echoes away.*

The Quorum Painting

Isbeil. Her closest advisor. It&apos;s gotta be. All it took were a few magic tricks for her to make Justinia&apos;s eyes all wide and wonderin&apos;...
*And then she&apos;s here no more.*
Sadha didn&apos;t escape? Then she must still be inside!
T-thank the Divine! No... thank &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;d be dead if it wasn&apos;t for you.
There are more important stories than mine. The Seekers. The Magisters. These are the tales of this world.
I&apos;ve prayed to Amadia real hard, but I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s done much good. Still a wizard trapped in a pig&apos;s body. Any ideas?
*Isbeil returns to her recap; she seems an endless font of knowledge.*
*Reluctantly show the guard your bag.*
*Take a breath. Tell it you&apos;re ready.*
*She glances up at you with interest.*
That one day I can be freed. That one day a new Godwoken will rise!
Is that thing... eating... corpses?
*The Magister is rubbing the dirt off his robes, none the worse for wear, apparently, from the blast of magic that knocked him off his feet.*

The demon was banished.
I have my little helpers, here, there, and everywhere. They find me the finest morsels in all of Arx. After all - why should the most delectable of foodstuffs grace only the tables of the nobility?
*Ask if he means the queen and her advisor.*
&lt;i&gt;Money. &lt;/i&gt;The very reason every Lone Wolf in the land is looking to sink its teeth into your flesh!

Please, don&apos;t exert yourself too hard. It&apos;s not as if one of us is gravely wounded or anything.
Spirit of Citizen Breifne
Me either.
What kind of power is needed to humble the gods themselves? This is starting to feel like a suicide mission...
All is forgiven - if you do right by your kin.
*Warn the bird to keep its distance - you don&apos;t want to catch... whatever it has.*
Never mind. Maybe some day. Keep the dream alive, hey?

But wars leave scars. Ruins, weapons, bodies - a story writ large across the landscape.
You will speak, or we will burn you leaf by leaf, vein by vein!

Tools for small item crafting.
Such an excellent question, but a bit premature, don&apos;t you think? We adhere to a certain decorum in this court. I am certain you understand.
And putting our faith in you is a risk Rivellon must take.
*Tell him you&apos;re not sure about committing murder in his name.*
*You feel an invisible hand grab you by the throat. Cold, unseen lips brush your ear.*
Ah. Well there you have it. Drudgery in life and insult in death.
*Say you&apos;re ready.*
*You recognise the scar as a lizard slave mark. Quickly assure her you&apos;re no slaver.*
Then it is I who must be the Prime Scion!
*Hand her the egg you found.*
[LIZARD] *Hiss quietly as you see the rage in his barbaric human eyes. Ask when the criminal&apos;s trial is  to be held.*
*Leap on him, pulling him to the ground.*
Goodness gracious me, what a &lt;i&gt;boor!&lt;/i&gt; Off with you! Quite clearly you wouldn&apos;t have done at all. Shoo!
Hearing determines how quickly you&apos;ll be able to hear enemies
*Change your mind.*
The Ancient Empire consulate... we were swarmed by Voidwoken. And everything just... caught fire! We couldn&apos;t quench it. What if someone is still there? And those monsters, my &lt;i&gt;gods!&lt;/i&gt;
You did...? It can&apos;t be! You&apos;re not pure enough, I&apos;d be able to tell if you were...

With a lot of skill and a little luck, this rogue sees the world as an open coffer
*He rolls his eyes, exasperated.*
Ultimate Augmentor Herb
As if Rivellon doesn&apos;t have enough horrors as it is...
My very life&apos;s work was to hide key intelligence from the light of both sun and Source. What I know, and what I have seen, shall remain in shadow.
Where have you &lt;i&gt;been?&lt;/i&gt; I can&apos;t keep this up much longer. We need to go.
Kemm&apos;s Deflector
Egg baby gone, gone, gone...
*Ask her why she would give herself to the God King.*
Please - none of that! I&apos;m still me. Different... yes. But you and I made this journey &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt;. Without you, I&apos;d still be in Fort Joy.
I&apos;ll help Fane fight for his Divinity and the salvation of his people.
Now close your eyes and listen to the heart. Become one with the heart.
Blimey! Must be real fun parties you throw back home. Slave folk like myself, eh? Go kiss a rat&apos;s behind, why don&apos;t you?
Natalie&apos;s Anguish
My lungs... they hurt...
Even if that person is &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, even after we&apos;ve shared so much.
So the Reds think they can butcher us like hogs and get away with it? My blade&apos;s going to taste their blood before the day&apos;s out. I swear it.
No sense hanging &apos;round here. If the Queen&apos;s anywhere, she&apos;s &lt;i&gt;inside &lt;/i&gt;Arx.&lt;br&gt;
Don&apos;t fail me.
*Say that you may make it to Arx eventually, though not quite for the festival.*

*He leans forward. Glimpsed beneath the crumpled helmet is a mangled face and crazed, unblinking eyes.*
*The petrified woman waits - but if her blood-red eyes are any indication, she doesn&apos;t do so patiently.*
Ahh get out of here, the both of ye. Y&apos;ain&apos;t worth the sweat of my brow anyhow...
*Wish him luck. You should be on your way.*
The misssstressss is mossst welcome.
*Lie and tell her you heard there had been quite some trouble with Voidwoken here, and you wanted to offer your assistance.*
The sky is weeping red tears. Bolts of coagulated blood fall on enemy characters in the area, each dealing [1] and setting Disease and Decaying. Turns water in the area into blood.
