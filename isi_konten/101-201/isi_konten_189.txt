So you dare defy the will of Braccus Rex? Prepare to be destroyed, and so on and so forth. Let&apos;s get this over with.
The key is exceedingly smoothed and polished, as though it had been rubbed in many a pocket over the years.
I&apos;ll feel far less put upon if you tell me you learned something &lt;i&gt;useful &lt;/i&gt;on our little field trip.
Am I that transparent? I&apos;m a little on edge, it&apos;s true.
[UNDEAD] *Remark that you doubt she could help you with what you &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;want.*
The great allegiance stood once more, but the war continued.

*He intensifies his gaze on the lizard Lone Wolf before him. If looks were poison, she&apos;d soon be dead.*
Yes, well, I&apos;ve got more on my mind than shuttling you from hill to dale, but even I recognise the power of &lt;i&gt;priorities&lt;/i&gt;, darling.
*He raises a finger to his temple in salute, and fades away.*
*He sniffs. He snarls.*
Pick a side.
*Apologise. You didn&apos;t mean to offend her.*
Combine items&lt;br&gt;to discover recipes
I watched the gate. But the one who should be dead is dead.
Lohse&apos;s exorcism failed. Jahan asked to travel with us to Arx, where he says the demon is hiding.
Dextrous arts? What are you looking for exactly, a tapestry embroiderer?
I couldn&apos;t help them. But I can stop him from taking any more people. Never again. That&apos;s my promise to them. Never again.
*The spirit of a dwarf watches the ceremony with a scowl. He tugs at his ornate collar in an effort to loosen it.*
Stuck up here on guard while they all have fun looting that vault down under the barracks. Kemm&apos;s got it in for me, I swear.
Keep your magical items in check.
You will be my champion. You will protect our people.
You-... you never did mince your words, Master Fane. You were always straight with us.
Grasping Gloves
That&apos;s one way to look at it, I suppose. Gareth&apos;s a man of faith. Real faith. The kind you don&apos;t much see anymore.
How can a beast enjoy this, when he&apos;s no notion of what his future holds? I&apos;ll be spooked &apos;til I&apos;m securely hitched up again.
The Paladins at the Meadows would very much appreciate it if someone were to take the head of Mummie Dearest.
Detonation
Goat&apos;s cheese? Mother, are you &lt;i&gt;mad?!&lt;/i&gt;
*Once more you&apos;re in the great dark, but you deftly follow your guide in utter silence. The unseen tendrils lash, but do not find you.*
It was only about the power of divinity!
I bet a trip to prison will help teach you a lesson or two.
*The Red Prince&apos;s spirit stands silent, contemplating the waves as they lap against the hull.*
*Show him the blood-stained sword. Tell him his &apos;Sourcerer&apos; is dead.*
*Note that Gwydian&apos;s not with her. Where&apos;s he gone?*
Our differences were many. Lohse left the party for good.
I am the push, Sebille, the push come to shove and shred.
...this world of war and cruelty they created.
It&apos;s Butter. She said she&apos;d wait for me in Arx if she ever escaped. And... so she did.
She managed to elude her Black Ring captors and make it to the safety of our consulate here in the city, only to be attacked by Voidwoken!
*Tell him you&apos;ve changed your mind and bid him a good day.*
I respect that choice, Lohse. If you knew me better you&apos;d appreciate just how deeply I respect that choice. So let me be your teacher: one who can most certainly aid you in the quest for divinity, and perhaps even in the quest for true freedom...
Level Up!
If it&apos;s bad luck when a black cat &lt;i&gt;crosses &lt;/i&gt;your path, how bad is it if they &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt; on it?
I can spare a couple. They all walk with Lucian. They will see you through.
Well. It&apos;s complicated. Where to even begin?
Can I... can I keep the gold? Please.
*She spots the lizard in your company and sighs with relief.*
See? I was right! Thank you. I knew the master loved me more, else he wouldn&apos;t have let me go down to where all the juicy meat bones are!
*Take your leave.*
Hope you can help us out, sister. I ain&apos;t ashamed to admit we need it.
And, like flies to honey,
Perhaps he may find some time for us later.
*Seize her by the hand and demand she return your gold.*
It ain&apos;t a pretty way to go.
Mind control or no, he&apos;ll be livid when he finds out what they- what we did...
I&apos;d rather mount a syphilitic sow.
...this is Livy. &lt;i&gt;Was &lt;/i&gt;Livy. Lovrik didn&apos;t like goats. Once I&apos;m through boiling her bones, he&apos;ll be rid of her for good.
Go on. Step in from the shadows. Let&apos;s have a look at the wanderer lost in the woods.
The chef? Interesting... If you have proof of that, I&apos;d speak with Magister Carver.
Must be some kind of trick...
*The innards fall to the floor, landing in a pool of dark bile. You&apos;d expect fish to smell, but these reek.*
Please, you&apos;ve got to help me! My wife - they want to kill her.
Spirit Vision: Seeing Ghosts
*Shrug and tell him you don&apos;t care one way or another.*
Blessed be Zara&apos;s memory. I pray you honour it.
Zombie Painting
That so? Oh hey, you&apos;re right; reckon the dwarf I&apos;m thinkin&apos; of was got rid of last week. Probably for the best; Griff cut her real good.
*Thank her for this information and promise to investigate.*
*The Silent Monk sways and gurgles, head cast down.*
Of course I understand it! It&apos;s the language of the demons. I consider it my scholarly duty to know what I can of them, including their common tongue.
*You hear a faint thud, thud, thud; he&apos;s alive, but only just.*
*Your rage propels you so fast she has no time to respond. Before her eyes even blink once, her Source is yours to control.*
Yvette&apos;s Chest
I&apos;ve got big plans for you, Lohse. For both of us. But you need to be strong. You need to push, to crave, to LIVE!

There will be no more war. No more pain. No more misery. They will only know peace.
The island of Fort Joy remained a Sourcerer&apos;s &apos;paradise&apos;,
*Explain that you&apos;ve uncovered a cache of Source weapons in the basement.*
Once that is understood, I am quite content. Lead on, oh adequate one.
*Say that you are.*
My slave, of course! Oh, but I see. Yes, I suppose it must take some time for the full extent of my disheartening refusal to sink in.
*The waiter, you say, leaves the scene.*
Time to go. Mummy said not to talk to strangers.
The cat in the garden may be evidence of a link between Kemm and the missing Arhu.
*Nod. It could work out well for both of you.*
*Say that you&apos;ve been mulling over his story... and you&apos;ve decided that he&apos;s hiding something.*

*A single tear rolls down his cheek.*
Set each sun/moon pedestal correctly.
*The Magisters scramble for their weapons, but pause as the smoke clears.*
Lord Horlan the Just
Why, torture. What else?
Long, long ago... many years before you were born, my little brood pudding... I was born in a desert land far from here. And stolen! I was &lt;i&gt;stolen&lt;/i&gt; from my own queen as an unhatched egg.
*Ask the judge to spare you the party line. This is nothing more than murder.*
I&apos;d give two boots and a nail for a map out o&apos;here...
The House of Shadows was after the armour of the Devourer. They believed one piece was on the Nameless Isle, with two more hidden in the humans&apos; capital city: one in the hands of a man named Kemm, the other guarded by lizards.
*Tell Sebille you wonder how she ever managed to escape from her Master.*
*Express surprise at seeing her alive. Didn&apos;t she die aboard the ship that brought you both to Fort Joy?*
*Tell her you&apos;re not quite ready to set sail just yet.*
My, my, I did get you all worked up didn&apos;t I? Afraid you won&apos;t be able to sleep tonight?
Betty
Learn the name of the demon.
Listen here: your behaviour of late is annoying me to no end!
Leave me alone, Mother.
On the Godwoken&apos;s command, a disgusted Malady left the candles burning. This, she believes, is a grave mistake.
*Nod. Say you guess that means she met one of the gods as well.*
We have an intruder. Guards, to arms!
Friend of a Friend
*Remove your hand - &lt;i&gt;quickly.*&lt;/i&gt;
These are chains of pure Source. Not even the Divine, the gods rest his tortured soul, could break them. Set me free, and I shall give you the power that you seek.
We don&apos;t need to talk about that. You&apos;re an adult. I&apos;m an adult. The heart wants what it wants.
MmmmMMM! Mm!
You can &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;delay&lt;/font&gt; your turn to the end of the round by using the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Delay Turn&lt;/font&gt; skill.
*Saheila keeps her expression carefully blank. Sebille turns away. She looks... troubled.*
I don&apos;t remember much... I barely had time to realise the Magisters were attacking before I was injured... the last thing I saw were these things, these &lt;i&gt;Shriekers...&lt;/i&gt;
Perhaps not, but your people need you. Those few of us that remain, at least.
*Offer an arm and help it to its feet.*
A thief &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a con artist? There is only one proper place for your kind: prison.
*He folds his arms over his ample crimson belly.*
*She seems a little... obsessed with Gareth. Ask why he&apos;s so important to her.*
Keep your eyes peeled for a Dreamer. Brahmos the Wanderer promised he&apos;d be here...
You lookin&apos; to buy somethin&apos;?
Character suffers the consequences of losing a Challenge.
More power to you, brother. Not many people live life to their own rules.
Thank you... and be careful. Many have rose up against him, but none have succeeded. None have even come close.
Duration: [1] Turns
That&apos;s right, Lyn. That&apos;s surely right. Here - take this. Dear friend of ours left &apos;em with us for safekeeping... but I don&apos;t think she&apos;ll be back any time soon.
Cold steel it is, then.
*The Doctor turns to Beast after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*
Bracer
Righteous
They&apos;ve heard the Shriekers shriek. I thank the goddess I&apos;m not haunted by their sound!
*Your knife slides into the human&apos;s neck. Another clean kill. It is only then that you notice a pair of eyes shining in the darkness. A dog, cowering in the corner. You smile and whistle. &apos;Here boy. Here boy...&apos;*
*The Doctor turns to Fane after the late Divine falls, lifts a vial of marrow, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*

No dagger weapon equipped&lt;br&gt;
*The spirit of a Black Ring conjurer looks around in confusion, seemingly oblivious to you.*
*Aggressively force the spirit back through its memories. Harangue it with mental images of what you want to know - who is killing Magisters?*
*Tell her you are a master, the Champion of two Arenas: Fort Joy &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Driftwood.*
Determines magic damage
*As she pushes off of you, she reaches lightly into your pouch. She rifles around for a moment, but doesn&apos;t seem to find what she&apos;s looking for.*
Find Charlie&apos;s missing ball.
The lovers thanked us.
I&apos;ll... see you around. Sooner than we&apos;d like, I imagine.
So it was an elf all this time... perhaps the Magisters were right to remove my kind from their ranks... the fiend has faced justice, I assume...?
