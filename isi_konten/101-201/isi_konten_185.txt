Well, I&apos;ll be thrice-cussed to the Void: Ifan ben-Mezd! I saw them collar you good, boy. Didn&apos;t think we&apos;d hear you growling around here again.
For I am Tir-Cendelius, god of the elves. God of you.
Go on: &lt;i&gt;Spin.&lt;/i&gt;
I know what you are, Fane. You have no right to anything! You&apos;ll have time to think about your sins when the darkness comes for you once again.
*Tell him to turn out his pockets and prove it.*
What part of &apos;talk sense&apos; passed you by? I ain&apos;t killing my brothers and, if I stay right here, they ain&apos;t killing me.
*Words fail her, so instead she throws her arms around you in a big hug. She isn&apos;t the slightest bit concerned by your skeletal form.*
*There is more, but she hesitates to share it. Then she decides that she must.*
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The Eternal. Take him. The Eternal. Take... take... the Eternal...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
But beware - many obstacles remain. I can help with only one. The Death Room is a chamber of many levers. Five will lead you closer to your goal - the rest will lead you to your death.
Decorative Lizard Sword
Dorotya, the Decadent One
*A great surge of water engulfs you. It spreads and soaks the land... not water after all, but &lt;i&gt;blood &lt;/i&gt;- the blood of armies. The blood of &lt;i&gt;your kin&lt;/i&gt;. The earth grows red and sodden.*
Fight Music
The one who makes demands, of course. The one who cowers inside you even now, afraid to face me.
Lass, you rarely lead me wrong. Call it. I know you got my back.
*Tell her there&apos;s no point in attacking you. She has the teeth, but you have the magic. And she&apos;s all alone.*
*Say the sea sounds angry, like it&apos;s trying to capsize the ship.*
Invulnerable
My baby boy. It can&apos;t be...
*Shrug, and say that they&apos;re pretty enough.*
If not for that harlot, these centuries would have been ours to enjoy in the moonlight. She stole our future and left us to rot.

Annual Vault Inventory&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Additions:&lt;br&gt;VII Dynasty cutlery set&lt;br&gt;Paired elven ritual vases&lt;br&gt;Bust of the Maiden (arms missing)&lt;br&gt;The Devourerâ€™s Maw (helmet)&lt;br&gt;Arx Cathedral Model, not to scale&lt;br&gt;Gilded Quadriga of the Second Elven Queen&lt;br&gt;Warhorn of the Dawn (dented, needs repairs)
*Politely decline. You haven&apos;t the time for a picnic.*
*Ask him how royalty finds life on the road.*
*The marking on the door was painted recently, judging from its pungent scent. You recognise the symbol immediately for what it is: a warning of Deathfog within.*
Malicious Broadsword
No, I am more your mother than some creature of flesh ever was.
*The spirit ponders your question, and seems to... shiver.*
I knew it the moment you walked in here. &apos;&apos;ere comes an enterprising lass,&apos; I said to meself. &apos;&apos;ere comes a woman who could take a sum of gold and turn a tidy profit.&apos; I can see it in your eyes.
*Say it has nothing to do with &apos;your kind.&apos; You would&apos;ve helped a human, too.*
*Accept the gift.*
I pity anyone hiding here. Voidwoken&apos;d get him before we do...
*Ask if it&apos;s found the answer yet.*
*You and Sebille spend the night playing dice, laughing and drinking.*
It doesn&apos;t matter what &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;said, &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am the authority here, &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am the Magister Inquisitor, and &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;am charged with ending Sourcerers. Kilgallion lies dead by your hand, and you, you stinking Sourcerer, &lt;i&gt;will join him!&lt;/i&gt;
*Insist a decision must be made. How does she want to proceed?*
*You feel the weight of the Black Mirror in your pocket. Ask if Alexandar is around anywhere...*
Look me in the eye.
The beggar&apos;s dog was at the Stonegarden. It told us that the memorial near the centre smelled strange - similar to the Fish Works in Driftwood.
How &apos;bout a little tune to spice things up around here.
So... where should we start?
*Look deeper into his eyes; seek the source of the flicker.*
Summons a condor that will aid you in combat.
*Give him a wink and tell him it&apos;s always a pleasure to meet a fan.*
Who needs a plate where we&apos;re going?
Home
*The spirit of a Black Ring defiler swings her ghostly blade at invisible foes.*
*Smile at the scene. It&apos;s good when a Magister gets what&apos;s coming to him.*
Divine save me, I don&apos;t want to die please, I don&apos;t wanttodieIdontwantto&lt;i&gt;dieeearrgh!&lt;/i&gt;
We found a Black Ring mirror hidden in Kemm&apos;s attic - when we gazed into it, we saw the final moments the Sallow Man, trapped surrounded by fire and molten rock as the Nameless Isle was destroyed. How did Kemm come by this? Was he spying on the Black Ring... or doing something else?
Bandit Dwarf Tracker
Catherine
Lives in my heart, doesn&apos;t he? Yours too, if you listen.
*Tell her you&apos;ve never wanted anyone more in your life.*
What the... I&apos;ve been robbed!
I might regret this, but... you&apos;ve got yourself a deal.
A Generous Offer
What? A bicorne of such beauty should never near your lousy head! You disrespect Fran, and you disrespect &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; Yeh might as well chop off my whiskers in the dead of night!
Magister Cold Case Reports
&lt;i&gt;No!&lt;/i&gt; I thought he was in his chambers, gathering himself for the Lucian&apos;s Day ceremonials.
Guardian Angel Skillbook
This grenade creates a blessed ice surface.
Sebille destroyed the Mother Tree. She liberated the elves from a tyrant.
*You think you probably &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;going to have to kill him.*
*She huffs in annoyance and rolls her eyes.*
Cave
They listened to &lt;i&gt;Lucian&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Obeyed&lt;/i&gt; Lucian. After everything he did? They allowed him to take our Source. And restored a tyrant to power.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him your name is Sebille.*
*Say you&apos;re terribly sorry for her loss.*
&lt;i&gt;You&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; not Magister Gremory.
SMASH IT. SMASH IT!
*Tell him to mind his own damn business.*
Moving to rapid-descent cranial disruptor!
&lt;i&gt;Consumed? No. &lt;/i&gt;Embraced.
Clear Vignette
*He whistles for his assassins.*
*Reach out and touch him.*
It&apos;s gotta be. All it took were a few magic tricks for her to make Justinia&apos;s eyes all wide and wonderin&apos;...
Tainted Stew
Mask Of Strength
Our finest pupil, the Divine himself, came to us here under the guise of friendship. Then, at this very table, he &lt;i&gt;poisoned &lt;/i&gt;us.
Navigate
Solid Metal Key
Ghost Whispers
We&apos;re more than capable! But if you want to stick your neck over the parapet, don&apos;t let me stop you.
*Grab the jar and hurl it into the ground, freeing the soul trapped inside.*
The ancient priestess Gratiana sent us to Braccus Rex&apos;s armoury in search of Purging Wands to aid our escape.
Higba
Ho, kin! Come, come! I know this hellish place seems devoid of welcome.
*Move your arm close enough for him to touch you.*
*You feel him in your head, scrabbling for purchase amongst your thoughts, looking for a way in, his madness and his anger and his hate banging on the door of your mind... looking for the stink of &lt;i&gt;Lone Wolf.*&lt;/i&gt;
Go ahead and try. Maybe a &lt;i&gt;purebreed &lt;/i&gt;will have better luck than I did.
Search on for a lizard dreamer.
*Level with him. His family is dead. The Magisters executed them.*
Many have sought to kill the doctor. None have succeeded. I am one of those hunters who became prey. He possessed me, and forced me to do his bidding.
Have&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;you&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;come to add me to your growing pile of corpses, Beast? How... &lt;i&gt;expected&lt;/i&gt; of you.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without helping Gareth.
*Hey, you&apos;re not done! Reach out and grab her by the arm.*
Bock BOCK!
*Push back. Burrow into the Sallow Man&apos;s head, looking for the secrets of the Council of Seven.*
I should have looked after her myself. She might still be alive then.
Such a long journey you have undertaken... in the service of thieving charlatans... in pursuit of that which you will never obtain...
*Say that you have decided to be merciful, though she doesn&apos;t deserve it, and take your leave.*
*As the cursed branches slither away from Rhalic, he raises his head. Green eyes glint with sudden fire from behind his helmet.*
*Beast&apos;s laugh trails off. He looks to the ground - an uncharacteristic moment for a dwarf who&apos;s rarely at a loss for words.*
Yes, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve all the makings of a hero and all that, but let&apos;s not get carried away, shall we?
*Tell him you couldn&apos;t help but overhear some of the nuggets of wisdom he just received.*
&apos;Here lies Corman Crossley.&lt;br&gt;Worked hard for his living.&lt;br&gt;His rest is earned.&apos;
When you&apos;ve lived as long as I have, you&apos;ll realise they are almost the same thing.
See, Ben? I told you so. If Fort Joy wasn&apos;t nice they&apos;d come home to Driftwood.
Do not, however, assume that every Paladin offers safe haven. The enemy of your enemy is not always a friend.
The lancet proudly wears your blood like a crimson cloak.
Portal
A trick I learned along the way. A way to use my... powers. They call us by so many different names, don&apos;t they? First Sourcerer, then Godwoken... all the while dangling another one in front of us: &lt;i&gt;Divine.&lt;/i&gt;
Axes of Evel
*A spirit sits behind the grand piano, her hands moving to and fro along the ivory keys.*
Meaty Stew
*You see a man, well-fed and wealthy - but stress has lined his face and narrowed his waist.*
*Ask her to tell you about the &apos;crate-dwarves&apos;.*
*She points to the Thieves&apos; Guild&apos;s location on your map, and rubs her palms together.*
To save Eleanessa, her doctor - Daeva - brought her to the island. The exorcism killed her.
Make no mistake, Godwoken - I do not &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;to work with you. I will enter the Council when I am fit and ready...
Bowl
*Say that he mentioned ciphers - what did he mean?*
Hero of Autumn
Carved from wood, bark and tree&lt;br&gt;Born from fire, blazing heat&lt;br&gt;Fueled by oil, dark and raw&lt;br&gt;A rune of flame from ashes draw
The young woman will recover, nursed by Swann. Impressed by our success, he offered his services as a healer.
Can&apos;t seem to find my... what&apos;s this? Oh, well. I just remembered something I needed to do. Goodbye, then!
Please! Help us get the boat down!
*He nods over to the corpse of a Magister nearby.*
Remove the curse from the lever.
*The whispers shuffle away and the air shifts. Whatever was here a moment ago is gone now.*
Deactivate Encounter
I can sense the expanse of Source inside you. There is only one more thing you must remember now: the spell you will need when we reach the Well of Ascension.
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Chemical Warfare Grenade
Toggle Skill
Kill him &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.
Don&apos;t know the Slaver of the Seas too well, do ye?
Just... &lt;i&gt;be careful&lt;/i&gt;. I wasn&apos;t jesting before - she was already a powerful Sourcerer by the looks of things, but whatever it is that&apos;s happened to her... it&apos;s left her dangerous.
The shinies! One moment, sun. Then, I feel darkness in me, and hear all the noise. So much noise. Clank, moan, clink, groan.
*Tell him that the ship is immobile. Does he know what might be causing that?*
Forest - River Bridge B
*It&apos;s over. The Lone Wolves are next, and your needle beckons.*
Well-hidden Mine
Incandescent Marksman
No, this piece is far beyond what those wretches could muster... this is something of my own design, to meet my own requirements.
As if your guilt could be any more plain.
I&apos;m sure your skill would prove invaluable, were there Voidwoken left to slay. I&apos;m afraid the terrors waiting within aren&apos;t so &lt;i&gt;tangible, &lt;/i&gt;however.
I suspected as much. I wonder if there is nothing those beasts will not do. My heart aches for the Seekers.
Get your general supplies while you can!
Lizards apparently have ancient magic that allows them to control slaves that bear their mark by singing a song. Dallis must have had an interest in those techniques.
The Spirit of Sarias
