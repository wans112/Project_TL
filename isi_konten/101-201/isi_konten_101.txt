I am... death! Yes, yes. Death!
*Ask the lizard what he&apos;s talking about.*
Owl Die
And yet strangely I still feel tired.
You! Vandal! I&apos;m taking you to a prison cell. Nothing you can destroy in there.
*So this mask he&apos;s looking for - what is it exactly?*
So? Heard any word about the stolen supplies? C&apos;mon, freshie, out with it!
I... I had hoped maybe I could have been the one to solve the disappearances. Perhaps my comrades would have accepted me back into the fold then...
The princess seems to have a new vigor! It&apos;s so good to see her spirits lifted after all this time!
Worm Mucus
[HERO] *Tell him that no-one needs to die. You only want to talk.*
Yup! Some stuffy duke yanks off the lid, and good ol&apos; Beastie jumps out!
It should, but it may not be enough. Braccus&apos;s vault contains powerful relics called Soul Jars. If you bring me one, it could change &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
*Zimski pointedly ignores your attempts at communication.*
A heavily perfumed diary with many competing smells vying for the attention of your exhausted nostrils.
*Ask what happened between him and Dallis.*
Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. A god no less, and me in no state to shake hands.
Prove it. Or else get out.
*Shrug. If anything, you feel weaker for what you&apos;ve just done.*
I suppose. Well, be careful out there. There are ruffians of all sorts wandering about.
*The cold slips away from you, out of your brain, neck, shoulders, arm, and fingertips. The vision fades.*
Sadha, the Red Princess, was in the consulate when the Voidwoken attacked.
Find Saheila and her people.
*Feed her the potion.*
*BAA!* This is madness! I&apos;m... I&apos;m having flashbacks from the Great War!
Godsdamnit. Well if that be the case, you can be on your way.
*Shrugs.* The usual fuss - the groom&apos;s a local alchemist, marryin&apos; the daughter of some bigshot merchant.
*Samadel smiles with relief at Han&apos;s healed leg, bowing gently in thanks when your eyes meet.*
I... I... I really can&apos;t tell you more. I owe Alexandar everything. I don&apos;t question him.
You can grab me all you like, mortal, but a man&apos;s books? Is nothing sacred?
*He considers you for a moment - and tells his tale.*
Here you go breaking my heart.
*Bow your head, and share the story of your journey along the Path of Blood.*
Only you know the truth.
*She stiffens and stands upright, running her fingers through her hair. She smiles. Smirks, really.*
*Ask what she&apos;s smoking.*
Help! Over here!
Dungeon - Empty Room
*Several hours later, Sadha and the Red Prince exit the wagon hand in hand. He glares at you and is about to say something when you suddenly witness a group of lizards appearing as if out of nowhere.*
Crafting Panel
*Say that despite the Shadow Prince being a villain, you think he&apos;s right and that the Red Princess may have to be undone.*
Do what you must, but above all you must tell the truth. I see your shadows. But I see the light in you too.
Ferocity Herbmix
Sunny
Shieldbearer
LAN
*Tell him you found a ring in the water just now.*
I don&apos;t usually like people. But you smell... acceptable.
Squee squee squeeeeee! *Oink*
Select the type of clue characters and monsters have in peace mode that shows their alignment towards you. Circle is a coloured circle at their base. Outline is a coloured outline border.
No... just another &lt;i&gt;thief.&lt;/i&gt;
Poisoned status is ignored. Still taking damage from poison attacks.
*Nod and say that you have your own business to get on with.*
We entered the Council of Seven, one step closer to Divinity. Now I must be first to the Wellspring. Godhood awaits.
Are you... &lt;i&gt;sure?&lt;/i&gt;
Portal of Dreams
Well you&apos;ve heard of it now, ain&apos;t ya? Go on then, freshie - turn &apos;em out!
A gem that once adorned the head of a puppet.
*The dwarf refuses to speak and just glowers at you, a dark scowl on his face.*
I&apos;m Han. So, Ifan. You helped me out just there, so let me return the favour. You want to get out of here?
Can&apos;t be real, not real... not happening...
Mystical Small Thunder Rune
The portal will return you to Rivellon. May the fires that burn within you remain mighty, elf!
Unknown
Boss don&apos;t mind where the gold comes from, &apos;long as he gets his cut. Have a look, why don&apos;t you. Your cash is plenty good here!
*Scoff. It was more wrong by far to put their entire village in danger. Wonder aloud what the local Magisters would think about it...*
*Tell him you couldn&apos;t stop him from doing just that, but you&apos;re much better company alive than dead.*
Broken Silver Lever
But when the demons went to war, her needle would draw blood once more.
*Too little, too late. Walk away.*
Braccus, the clever dog. A &lt;i&gt;trap,&lt;/i&gt; he set. It&apos;s held me until this day, with naught but this fine coat for company.
*Growls...* &lt;i&gt;Three timezzz no.&lt;/i&gt;
*He spits over the parapet, shakes his head at what the world has come to, and returns to his duty.*
Press [IE_Interact] while facing an object to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;interact&lt;/font&gt; with it.
Lucian would&apos;ve rid us of this Voidwoken scourge in a day, as easily as he slew the Demon of lies.
*Tell her to keep it up, and maybe she&apos;ll get through to him.*
*Question his wisdom. That might not be the best idea...*
[1] was invulnerable to damage.
*Take a haughty tone, and announce that the powers that be will not take kindly to news of this harassment.*
*Argue that this &apos;traitor&apos; might have key information.*
I did. She&apos;s quite graciously taking us to demon-haunted Arx. Our pursuits align, and continue.
Soon we shall be victorious...
A big enough quiver for all your arrows.
*As the world fades away, you lose all sense of being grounded. You reach out, but you can feel yourself falling slowly, sinking into the depths of your own soul.*
Magical Two-Handed Breathing Axe
*Tell Malady the figurehead is branded with a living scar - the type your kin use to control its slaves.*
*The thick, close smell of rotten fish crowds you like a fog. Almost done: you slip something smooth and metallic into a barrel among the half-disintegrated and reeking fish carcasses.*
No rest. No rest until the killer is found...
Geyser
UI Character Creation Add Skill
May not look it, but I&apos;m pretty light on my toes, when I need to be. Did you have a specialty in mind?
Your time is up. This is &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;show.
Gods - we&apos;d best send word to Arx. They&apos;re bringing one of these right to Order headquarters!
Please, my child! Help my child!
Toys
My husband... he&apos;s gone? *Heavy sigh* I knew this day might come, given his position, and the state of things in the world. A noble risk, he called it...
Hahaha!
*Turn back to what you were doing.*

Please - would you let me compose a poem for you? It would be the most tremendous honour.
Hmph.
...everything&apos;s gonna be alright... everything&apos;s gonna be alright... everything&apos;s gonna be alright...
Mechanisms
Rhalic. The Gods. Are they dead? How can this be?
Beitris Milne
He&apos;s... he&apos;s a fellow... I know him. I know he got someone to stick me between the ribs. I know he... he wanted &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;...
Stark Trousers
Look who we have here! The boor, no less. I wouldn&apos;t have bet tuppence on your survival, yet here you are.
Alien Air Essence
What I wouldn&apos;t give for Hannag&apos;s advice right now...
They&apos;re gorillas.
*The spirit of the Magister continues to stare at nothing, ghostly shadows clouding his eyes.*
&lt;i&gt;My mind is fractured. Incomplete. If I have enough hosts... perhaps I will be whole. &lt;/i&gt;
*She raises what looks like a leash. A chuckle emerges from beneath Vredeman&apos;s hood. The chuckle becomes a guffaw, booming and hateful. Dallis flicks her wrist... and nothing happens.*
A pleasure doing business, even now.
You&apos;ve done right by me once. Now it&apos;s time to do right by your cousin.
A survivalist and a practitioner of magic, the Wayfarer is hard to hit and even harder to evade
Gregorius Swann
Poisoned Orange
Don&apos;t worry, honey. It isn&apos;t yours.
As for her neck, she&apos;s remembering the damnable Source collar she once wore. Same style as yours.
*The spirit strikes out at thin air near the cell door.*
*Ask if she removed her own collar.*
Mmm. Figured.
*Ask her to remind you what she&apos;s planning.*
I&apos;m not picking THAT up. I could try moving it...
I mean, obviously I could say no, in a variety of both verbal and non-verbal languages, but-
*...an elven child, the moon, the sun, the Void, the dirt, a death in the fog amongst the trees, the ugly hag in the desert alley whose sight you took, an artefact that powers a lever...*
[FANE] [SWORN] *Smirk and boast that &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;people are able to win back the King&apos;s love.*
*Sadha murmurs, her words unrecognisable, her spirit still.*
Shark
Gain 2 Action Point(s) immediately, but lose 2 Action Point(s) next turn.
*Lie. Tell her you can&apos;t recall.*
Temple of Vrogir
Ryker might get mad. He doesn&apos;t like it when someone... touches his things.
*Block the way.*
Clear
Do you like my new form? It serves its purpose. It allows me to speak to you. And it allows me to think. At last I see clearly. I know what must be done.
[JESTER] *Tell him a bad joke shared is a burden halved.*
*She stares at you for a moment before looking away, turning back to the face of the goddess.*
Thank you for freeing me. It seems the Gods parted the clouds and let a ray of sunshine through. My beloved Gwydian&apos;s home - and safe.
Blech.
[1] has successfully fled from combat
&lt;i&gt;Huuurgle guurgle&lt;/i&gt;
She&apos;ll be back soon. I know it.
*He gives you a cool look and nods to a bloody corpse in Magister&apos;s garb.*
...Lucian I&apos;m coming I&apos;m coming Lucian I&apos;m coming Lucian Lucian I&apos;m coming coming coming...
*Ask Ifan if he&apos;s as weary as you are. Would he like to rest below decks with you for a spell?*
Where&apos;s my mother? I was talking to her a minute ago.
*Very well - say that you&apos;ll do it.*
*Introduce yourself.*
Learning Ledger
*Poke the sheep&apos;s ample belly with your toe. Remark that she&apos;s got more meat on her than you do.*
The Seekers are dead.
Die_Magic_Elec_3
I know my duty, Sourcerer. Because this... &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;this... all this &lt;i&gt;pain &lt;/i&gt;all this &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;...
*She nods and casts her gaze back into the pit where her comrade lies.*
I wish you good luck, but I won&apos;t promise you mercy.
I was too late, though.
Oh? OH? HeheheheHEHEHEEEE! In that case...
Quite a novel thing for me, this &apos;together&apos; concept. How about yourself?&lt;br&gt;
Rename Creature
Goodbye.
*Your blood warms. The roar of the flames drowns the screams. Syrus Oates begins to burn. He does not scream.*
Sorry news indeed. The harlot may have foiled our plot against Braccus, but today is not without its gifts.
*Squints...* Was that a guess?
*Ignore the ghost and walk away.*
*He squeezes your hand and winks, only moving away when he sees your answering smile.*
*That strange longing strikes you again.*
Lyn&apos;ll be crushed...
Godwoken! Release me! I&apos;ll take you to Lucian. He&apos;ll forgive you. He&apos;ll forgive us all!
We lose too much. We lose our homes. We lose our safety. We lose each other.
*She considers you for a moment, then releases a heart-rending sigh.*

Boots of the Faithful
Magical Ring Boots
What a pity. The stories that arise from the Rivellonian rubble will tell not of a saviour - but of a sinner.
I&apos;ve gone and thrown me wedding ring in the water.
