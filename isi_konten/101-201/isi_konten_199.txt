Dwarves? The pox on those bearded devils!
[BARBARIAN] *Growl that you&apos;re not comfortable with a problem you can&apos;t club into submission either.*
&lt;i&gt;Wait!&lt;/i&gt; Don&apos;t do this, please! I owe you my life, but I have to protect the Bishop. Don&apos;t make me raise my bow against you.
Gold Key
The city won&apos;t go down without a fight from me.
We told Corbin that he&apos;s free to go.
Long-range attack that deals [1] damage to a single target, leaving them Blind and Burning.
*Tell her to be careful or you&apos;ll pick up the rock and bash her brains in with it.*
&lt;i&gt;I lost everything&lt;/i&gt;. If you will not accept your rightful blame, then I shall return to my prayer.
*You stand in the dimly-lit room once more - the altar before you.*
Hero Stats
That Magister... he&apos;s the one from the jail in Driftwood. His &apos;better offer&apos; lead to his death, it seems.
We have all five pieces of the legendary Armour of Contamination.
Ya got anyone t&apos;help ya out? Can&apos;t see ya offin&apos; that thing on yer own!
*Note that he probably means Isbeil, the poisonous thorn in Justinia&apos;s side.*
*Tell him to go right ahead. You trust him.*
I&apos;ll do business with you. But keep your distance.
*Silently decline with a shake of your head.*
Pag Joph
You buyin&apos;, or just browsin&apos;? Make it quick either way, lizard.
Very well.
You&apos;ve got no call to go looking for no cargo. Far as anyone&apos;s concerned we sailed with an empty hold, and if there&apos;s anything left to salvage you leave it where it is.
*Without looking once in your direction, Kemm hefts his sword.*
*He glances up, and you see his eye sockets glow faintly. He seems to be taking in every detail.*
A phoenix egg is a priceless treasure. It should be cared for.
*Insist that Gareth kill Jonathan, here and now. It is the greater good.*
I&apos;d say we&apos;re making good progress already, no?
Spore-Infested Zombie
Petrified Burglar
Let us away - this primitive craft may not hold for much longer.
- &lt;i&gt;Dead. Dead! Demon scum, I&apos;ll flay your skin. I&apos;ll tear your&lt;/i&gt; - *grunt* Silence! Have some respect...
*Remind her that &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;attacked &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.*
Marge&apos;s egg! Margey! EGGY! EGGY BABY, MARGE! WAKE! UP!
Armoured Voidling
Blessed Steam
Boys! This&apos;n stole from Cap!
Contaminated
[FANE] *It is one thing to chase the unknown, but quite another to be caught. Assure her the risks are too great.*
As for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;...
Nothing amiss here. These puppets must need further calibration...
Come, give your heart to me.
Fair enough. Onwards?
*Tell him you&apos;re a creature of the world, always looking to explore the many hidden delights of this existence.*
*Snap your fingers and produce a Source flame. She should tell you where to find her helpers - for her own safety.*
Eternal Plate
Jahan&apos;s Lesson
*He pauses as if about to say something else, then shakes his head. With one last nod, he whistles up his soulwolf and lopes away.*
This puddle it... glows. What could this mean?
*The Source King Braccus Rex gives you a long, malevolent look - the glint in his eyes like bait, the smile below; the hook.*
Are you serious?
*Panic rises...*
*The spirit cannot speak - or perhaps chooses not to.*
Five gold pieces for a tomato? These bloody lizards are responsible for this. The sooner we wipe them out the better.
Thanks... for standing with me back there. For taking her out.
*Maintain your position.*
A fine choice. Jules should serve you well.
Sterling Amulet
[IFAN] *Tell him that you have a job to do. And apart from that, you intend to find answers and deliver vengeance.*
Magister Cryomancer
*Scowl. Zaleskar you presume? You &apos;learned&apos; from Griff you&apos;d find him here.*
Help Stewart investigate the Magister disappearances.
Item Interaction
It isn&apos;t just slaves that suffer, though, is it? You eternally seek perfection, though offer no room in the creaking Empire machine to the sage or the savant. &lt;i&gt;What say you?&lt;/i&gt;
Don&apos;t worry that someone else got the big prize, darling. You&apos;re still &lt;i&gt;marvellous &lt;/i&gt;in my eyes.
*The eagle glowers at you balefully with eyes like shiny little buttons. One manicured and be-ribboned claw shoots forth to claim the stringy offal before him. Stretching his neck forward, he peers closely at you.*
*Stand back.*
*The rat gives you a desperate look. &apos;Help me!&apos;*
A hidden bridge? Clever. Very clever.
*Work, work, work. That&apos;s all there was in Driftwood for a dwarf like you. Until you got involved in the anti-Magister resistance. Then, the work was still there, but also &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt;. Purpose worth dying for.*
*He grits his teeth in anger.*
*Promise you&apos;ll help her friend.*
We have entered a heavily-guarded section of the Fort. We had best not alert any Magisters to our presence.
*You come up empty. Perhaps there is nothing to find.*
Hope you ain&apos;t lookin&apos; fer work in this dyin&apos; town. Besides, you ain&apos;t got the look of a fisher about ya, I&apos;ll tell ya that much.
No &lt;i&gt;harm?&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;ve heard that before - right before a Sourcerer blasted a hole through my partner!
I wonder what prize was sweet enough to make &apos;em into this.
I can&apos;t say I&apos;m sad to see Murga ousted. She was a sore winner; spoiled it for the rest of us...
This isn&apos;t the Divine Order I signed up for - not anymore. I&apos;m done.
Order&apos;s been telling us all kinds of this-and-that about Godwoken. Haven&apos;t seen any evidence of &apos;em myself.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell him that you&apos;ve never seen such a thing... if you destroy it, you can&apos;t study it... you&apos;ll have to decline.*
Hmm. Not that I could judge a dwarf for his drinking habits. After all, the Kingdom is a shadow of its former self. &lt;i&gt;Who is to blame for its collapse?&lt;/i&gt;
Sooner or later, you&apos;ll have to make up your mind.
*Say that you suppose the entire race of elves will always be grateful for her sacrifice.*
I know it&apos;s the same ol&apos; sea breeze I&apos;ve always smelled. But it&apos;s different now, with Malady gone. I don&apos;t know how to explain. Maybe you do.
Permission indeed...
Rajjarima stole some of our Source powers.
And you&apos;re just an overweight newt, yet somehow your kind *sniff* has built an entire empire. Now leave my sight, lest I make an unseemly squeal.
Cannot use skill: skill not memorised&lt;br&gt;
Earth Resistance
&lt;i&gt;Haw! Dig your hole wherever you like. Dig your hole wherever you like. The Void is coming and all is nothing. Dig your hole wherever you like, that&apos;s the key.&lt;/i&gt;
We learned &apos;The Taming of the Holy Fire&apos;.
Maybe not now. And maybe not ever, too. Doesn&apos;t change how I feel.
The spirit of the Craftmistress proudly proclaimed that she shaped the Devourer armour from dragon&apos;s bones. She clearly worshipped the Outlaw Empress, and does not believe that she&apos;s dead.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 14: Hydrosophy
Like a newborn babe, this dough&apos;s potential is as vast as the imagination itself.
Despite what she did to me, I can&apos;t help but admire the woman a little... she&apos;s unwavering. She will break before she bends...
I stole it from Lord Kemm&apos;s house, didn&apos;t I? And so what? I only took one of them. The other two were too heavy.
Arrow Freezing
*He draws his sword and heads towards the barrel.*
*Ask her why she suddenly wants the Mother dead. She was telling you to listen to the Mother last you saw her.*
Clear Surface
Stop that elf! Her Sourcery must be silenced!
Have you made any progress with my request, dear? Have you found that tablet?
UI Cancel
It&apos;s good to be wary. But you needn&apos;t be wary of &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;d sooner cut off me own hands than kowtow to a tyrant - Boy Bishop least of all.
We found the graves of the stag and the poacher who&apos;d killed it.
Rogue
Explorers
The Covenant is broken. I feel it in my blood. I am sworn... no longer.
HOLY MOTHER OF DIVINE, THAT&apos;S LOUD!
DICE TYPE
*Both of you die.*
*In the span of just a few seconds, panic crosses her face, then sadness, then numbness.*
Holding Cells
Game Master
Fulton? What&apos;s going on? Can you hear me...?
You can do that?
We entered the vault. What lies within?
*She looks up to you, eyes wide with shock.*
Malevolence. Darkness. It hangs off you like an ill-fitting cloak, like rancid skin.
*The man taps his foot in time to the bard&apos;s tune - though he stills it as you draw near, and clears his throat.*
Swann&apos;s cellar was being used as a makeshift infirmary - with only one patient.
You shouldn&apos;t be sneaking around like that.
*Assure him that he&apos;ll probably have new work soon.*
I... I don&apos;t know. The names... They are Scions?
Once you see the world for what it really is, there is no un-seeing it. It&apos;s amazing, really - the lies we tell ourselves. The lies we tell others.
Stairway
*Unscrew the top of a healing potion, hold his head in your hands, and tip the contents into his mouth.*
There is no time to waste. I wait for your signal.
Be that as it may, whatever divinity committed to the rather dubious honour of being your creator, he does leave us with a question, doesn&apos;t he?
*Tell him you bring word of death. The beach is soaked in blood.*
We gave Gratiana her Soul Jar. She was deeply grateful.
She fell for you. It happens. I wouldn&apos;t get big-headed about it.
Potion of Focus
I am here to serve, Master. In this realm and any other, for as long as I must.
Now, now. Let&apos;s not intimidate our guest further, Isbeil; I am yet too intrigued to give him leave. Why do you allow the crimson prince before me?
Now get the hell out of my face.
*Say you&apos;re sorry, but you don&apos;t know what she means. If she explains, you may be able to help.*
*She bobs her head back and forth to an unheard hymn, then bids you a pensive farewell.*
&apos;Here lies an unknown thief&lt;br&gt;Who drank too much&lt;br&gt;And gave herself away.&lt;br&gt;We are glad to give her rest.&apos;
Find shelter. They search for you.
I tried potions already - no use.
You are not friends with the truth, it would seem. Tell me true &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, or be on your way.
If those things get to Ma, they can get to me too.
Rocks ahead, Cap&apos;n! Avast! Hahahahaha!
*He winks at you so hard and so theatrically, that one whole half of his face seems to squint.*
May he return indeed. Maybe then we can stop praying and get back to our lives.
My kindness only extends so far. Let her go - but keep the Swornbreaker.
[MYSTIC] *Tell him you value what you see beyond the veil more than what lies upon the earth.*
You&apos;re a slaver prince. Why would I chain my fate to one like you freely, like I was once forced to?
Yes, I can imagine it might be somewhat difficult for you to forever be in my shadow.
*Ask about the &apos;oss. The boss. The chief.*
*He slaps his thigh, tears of mirth rolling down his cheeks.*
Feral Howl
I did this... I did this...
*Insist that elves are not addicted to memories. They simply record them, so that all might learn from the mistakes of the past.*
But we&apos;ve got to move, then. The Order will be upon us soon.
Do not weep for their fate, my child: their doom is of their own making.
Maybe.
Not an imbecile. Just misguided. Wiser ones than him were lured by the promise of all that power. And it brought them to nothing but ruin.
Corpse Explosion Void
Barin! He still shoutin&apos; high hell from that cliff? I tell ya: that is one loyal lad.
&apos;Arthyr Bree lies here.&lt;br&gt;Sadly missed,&lt;br&gt;By customers and family alike.&apos;
Language
That&apos;s the demons&apos; way. They give out promises like sweets. Lure in the weak.
