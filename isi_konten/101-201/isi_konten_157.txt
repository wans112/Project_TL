*Gesture from your head down your frame with a flourish and tell her you&apos;re here.*
*Ask the pig how she came to be so cursed.*
Being behind bars suits you, murdering scum!
[JESTER] *Laugh in spite of yourself. Is this tragedy - or comedy?*
*Panic swamps her eyes and she hurriedly returns to her work.*
*The spirit continues to stand by and scowl at the ransacked barracks.*
Heavy Branch
Well... I would have helped you if I could... will you spare me anyway?
To see &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; is the only time that matters.
*Trying to read the symbols, you hear a faint whispering at the back of your mind - as if you&apos;re listening to the echoes of a past age.*
Someone, help! Murderer!
Ribbon
We persuaded Brother Robert to let us into the inner vault.
*Frown at the rabbit and ask if it&apos;s feeling unwell.*
Character is drunk. Can be sobered up with Clear-Minded status.
&lt;i&gt;C- ...cared fer?&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;m just... just restin&apos;. *Cough.* Ain&apos;t nothin&apos; wrong a strong... drink won&apos;t set right.
*Cautiously ask what happens next.*
Don&apos;t you know the prophecies? &lt;i&gt;&apos;One day a man and a woman will be born, and their skin will be red, and the fruit of their union will be Great Red Dragons.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
There is no safety in numbers.
*The squirrel turns away from you and crosses his arms. His cat lets out a long, low hiss.*
Bock bock bock...
*Ask him who the Magisters are looking for.*
*The tree sits lifeless now, bereft of memory, its Source gone forever. Dead wood now, it shall fade into the past.*
I see you. An elf by appearance is not always an elf by heart. Prove yourself - overcome the trial, and stand as a true elf.
Are you sure you want to stop hosting? Everyone will be disconnected.
That&apos;s not like them. Those boys grew up attached to the hip! And they were both so devoted to Lucian.
Memorised Skills
*Take a closer look at her.*
One hides in an enclave of the lizards. The other is locked away by a man named Kemm. Do not disappoint me.
Leave her to die.
Summon Oily Blob Skillbook
Ghechswol the Arena Master
I just need to get out of Driftwood. I can&apos;t risk being seen, but if you can get out of town, I can escape to Arx.
Although now that I think on it, the flesh may be optional. There are some talented necromancers in this world...
What is this? What is this sudden resolve?
*The hardwood door is staid and silent.*
The howls... they are silenced. How?
*Apologise, and ask if there&apos;s anything you can do to help.*
*Question how she could have kept her own father imprisoned here.*
If you are to be my champion, you mustn&apos;t be so easily seduced. I shudder to think I saved you from the roiling seas for nothing.
I refused Sadha&apos;s advances. Unknown lizards ambushed us, wishing to force our union! They were not of the House of Shadows.
*Try to comfort him: Those are just bones. His spirit is intact...*
[BARBARIAN] *Laugh. Yeah, he&apos;s dead. Tough break.*
You&apos;ll get what&apos;s coming to you. &apos;The good guy.&apos; &lt;i&gt;Everyone&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;their own good guy.
Remarkable! So hard to find a nice original such as this these days.
I&apos;m not sure. I have prayed to Amadia, but she offers no answers.
The Black Ring&apos;s pullin&apos; her strings. Should&apos;ve figured. But I gotta say - I&apos;d rather her just be straight-up cruel than simply too weak to resist an evil as flippin&apos; obvious as the Black Ring.
Sweet mother, bringer of magic, hear my prayer.
Do you feel clever? Good. Now, shall we get back to the matter in hand? We should work together, you know.
*Spits.* Then leave me be, coward! You&apos;re... you&apos;re of no use to me...
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him you wouldn&apos;t trust a Magister to get to the bottom of a butter dish.*
Increasing this ability shrinks NPC sight cones and improves your movement speed while sneaking.
All I know is that we don&apos;t want Deathfog catching a ride on the roarin&apos; Arx winds. Long as that stuff&apos;s around, no-one&apos;s safe.
You&apos;ve returned. To what end?
Do as you wish. The doors remain closed meanwhile.
Well, well, well, looks like the Reds&apos;ve been real busy lately. Are you gonna be as bad at cards as your friend? Wanna find out?
We need a boat. Now.
My people had an operation up in the caves outside town - good access to Red ships and plenty of privacy, too.
*Leave the spirit in peace.*
*A slight grin crosses the spirit&apos;s face. Whether her smile is sincere or not, you can&apos;t be sure.*
*Take your leave.*
Increase FreeCamera Rotation Speed
*Tell her to wait. You have some questions.*
From now, our paths must diverge.
Stand down, Magister Roe. This one is... &lt;i&gt;an old acquaintance&lt;/i&gt;, shall we say. Let her approach.
Baran&apos;s Electrifying Dagger
Keep your weapons stashed, hothead. I&apos;ll tell you what I know.
Did you really, now? Well and truly?
*The priestess breaks off her prayer just long enough to shoot you a look of disgust.*
*Say nothing, but get on the floor, hold Birdie close to you, and stroke his head.*
I sure hope so. But if it isn&apos;t... well, I meant what I said last night. I can&apos;t believe I went all these years without having &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;-
*Laughter rolls and echoes into infinity.*
Glad to see you made it, Ifan.
*Say that you want to hear about this &apos;bad place&apos;, that it came from.*
Took you for the smart kind. Looks like I might&apos;ve overestimated you. Pity.
Magical Headdress
Sounds like the same language as the Lone Wolves&apos; password &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar&apos; &lt;/i&gt;is from... but what could it mean?
Shrine to Amadia
But I can certainly do &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;honest work, which is to ensure you don&apos;t enter any further.
*Sigh* Yes, I suppose we had better find those that decided to elope with their winged friends.
*Tell her she&apos;s awfully casual about death. A trait not quite shared by the &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;dead.*
*Roll your eyes. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to talk to a &lt;i&gt;door&lt;/i&gt;. You can stand here all day.*
Snakeroot is dead. The spirit of the Black Widowmaker will be satisfied.
Been getting yourself into trouble, I see. You&apos;re under arrest, thief!
*You&apos;re not quite ready. Come back to your destiny later.*
Bow Kit Part II: Branch
*Nod fervently; there&apos;s nothing you want more.*
*An amused expression crinkles the crow&apos;s feet at Ifan&apos;s greying temples. His face looks a lot older than the bright green eyes gazing out.*
Spirit of an Adventurer
Now we must part ways. Happy hunting, Godwoken. Perhaps we will meet at the trials... or perhaps not.
Shoe
*Watch and listen.*
A tyrant? The Gods will see me rewarded for bringing killers to justice. Who cares what shite the historians scribble in their ridiculous fables?
Neat. You don&apos;t feel anything like scabs! Mum always said that&apos;s what lizard scales felt like.
Roost Anlon. I own this place. I&apos;d ask you to introduce yourself, but I already know who you are, &lt;i&gt;Prince&lt;/i&gt;. Or do you prefer being called &apos;Godwoken&apos;?
Robe
*He quickly recovers his composure.*

Ancient Empire Songbook
What are you looking at? Where have you taken me? This is not Arx.
Now, listen carefully, Shield. The plan is thus: Do. Not. Die.
*The ship trembles beneath your feet, but the kid&apos;s right. Say you&apos;ll go back to the lower deck and look for survivors.*
*Tell her you&apos;ve already spoken to Gareth. You saved him from his predicament.*
Yes, great!
Speaking of keeping up appearances...
Permafrost
*She locks her eyes with yours and smiles, then unsheathes her weapon and rises from her bow.*
*Ifan pauses as if about to say something else, then shakes his head. With one last nod, he whistles up his soulwolf and lopes off.*
The only thing you&apos;re buying from me is an early grave!
It thinks it has defeated me, defeated all the gods. But it underestimates human might. &lt;i&gt;Your &lt;/i&gt;might.
A very, very large-sized potion that restores your vitality. It makes a soft, tinkling sound when you shake it.
*He swings a backpack over his shoulder. It&apos;s filled to the brim with potions, grenades and magical charms.*
Horrible, isn&apos;t it? Horrible, horrible. Someone ate our last little baby...
Each day may be the day that I will finally be punished.
Come on then, come meet your maker!
*Say that you&apos;re no snitch.*
Toggle Combat Mode
*Answer &apos;Cassandra&apos;.*
Easy now, old chap. It isn&apos;t my fault she&apos;s dead.
Distinctive Trumpet of Death
T-that&apos;s it; two Seekers to fight at your side. Are you ready to attack?
Damned if I know. Some ancient ritual, he said. It gave him the power to twist our minds - to turn us into his puppets.
*List for Exter a variety of tactics taught by teachers past. The more robust the Seekers&apos; combat repertoire, the better chance they have.*
My baby! My girl! There you are!
Same as those poor souls. We finished clearing out this blasted room and wanted- *cough* wanted to move on to the next.
Did he regret becoming Divine?
*This isn&apos;t the time. Shake your head and move away.*
The Beast of the Sea returned to the dwarven kingdom to lead the dwarves in the fight against the Void. After a series of public blunders, Marcus eschewed political power and returned to the sea. The Beast and the Lady Vengeance sail on.
Search Isbeil&apos;s laboratory.
So often must we flee. So often must we run. At last I see that we must stop.
Magical Dagger
*She searches your face. A grin spreads upon her own.*
This is bad. Not just for me and mine; not just for you and yours. This is bad for... everyone.
*Refuse to help Gareth in his quest.*
*The altar shimmers as the power of your blessing washes over it. You close your eyes and find yourself looking out over a fetid mire, choking clouds of gas filling the air.*
*Tell them you work for the Magisters. You&apos;re here to retrieve Order property.*
Squirrel Die
Go ahead.
The sky cleared. I put down my beer. And she sang.
*Ask him to undress.*
[IFAN] *Say that you&apos;ll pass. You&apos;ve spent more than long enough in the company of your deepest self.*
&lt;b&gt;But perhaps we can make a deal? The world has changed since you started your nap.&lt;/b&gt;
*He stares past you, unblinking, unmoving.*
Do not mourn the- *cough* the fallen, my child.
*See what he has to trade.*
[SWORN] *Admit to knowing the lure of the God King yourself - and how you wish to rid yourself of his curse.*
We hold the key to her freedom. Give her the Swornbreaker. It is her only chance.

Keep a keen eye for clues. Whatever&apos;s happening here, we&apos;re on the back foot.
*Ask where you&apos;ll find these Soul Jars again.*
We found our way into the mill.
What are you, a Magister in disguise? &lt;i&gt;Demrou, demrou evdekeis!&lt;/i&gt;
Target a surface in melee radius. Elemental damage matching that surface is added to your ranged weapon attacks and ranged weapon-based skills.
Not like it&apos;s some common parlour-table book. I&apos;m looking for something more particular... a tome to teach me how to make corpses &lt;i&gt;explode&lt;/i&gt;.
*Leave the spirit in peace.*
*Say you remember her from the boat. Ask how she made it out of Fort Joy.*
I suppose... I suppose now I know.
*Mother and son fall into a tight embrace. One tear rolls down Mari&apos;s nose falls on the black stubble on Barin&apos;s head. She strokes the wet drop away, smiling.*
Let them come I say: keeps one sharp.
A well-made bar of metal fairly itching to be hammered into something useful.
