*A Magister guard approaches. Behind her, on the gallows, two lizards: one, in a Magister uniform, hangs dead from her neck; the other hangs from her hands, still alive.*
Gareth was going to check in on his parents in Paradise Downs. Perhaps we&apos;ll see him there.
I got Brannt out of here. He was wounded - he wouldn&apos;t have stood a chance if I hadn&apos;t helped. Hopefully some more made it as well...
Lohse&apos;s demon lives in Arx. We should be wary.
Nice. Have a good day!
Kemm&apos;s daughter Maddelyn saw her father in the garden with a strange cat. Could this have something to do with Arhu?
Sibyl&apos;s Gloves
*Leap as if to attack.*
*Ask her where they&apos;ve taken your stuff.*
No sooner do I fix t&apos;gear&apos;n the pallies here break it again. Them Voidwoken have heads of stone. Still, I&apos;d rather be fixing stuff than be lying there dead.
Ayup, sure do. Or did, leastways. All bulls can see the future. I&apos;m surprised you don&apos;t know that.
Oh, what have we here?!

Rich Carpet
Special
Swish! The Magisters certainly don&apos;t spare expenses, do they...
Sorry about that, but it had to be done.
Y-yes. You... you are right.
How lovely! I could really do with a banquet right about now. No-one among you is a gourmet chef by any chance?
Find the rest of the armour.
Magical Two-Handed Axe
&lt;b&gt;I&apos;m sure you know what being &apos;cooped up&apos; is like. In fact, I know that look. You&apos;re hungry. &lt;/b&gt;
Pray at each altar on the island.
*Tell him you saw Barstan Tungs. Ask why the Doctor cut out his tongue.*
Whatever I&apos;m looking for, I&apos;m not finding it...
Sign
I&apos;m lucky I was posted indoors - doubt I&apos;d be drawing breath now if I was in the garden...
You seem different to the others, Godwoken. Have you progressed far in the ritual? Tell me, what have you learned?
We convinced Cottontail and Dot that their master favours them equally.
*Tell them of the Silent Monks you&apos;ve met on your travels; putting them down is a merciful act.*
Alchemist Breeches
*Ask if she can explain what she was doing just a moment ago.*
Now, I’m a mercenary killer, one of the infamous Lone Wolves. And my next target is none other than Lucian’s own son...
You set right the original wrong.
Grrrrrrrrwuh?
Hey! You! Out with it - where&apos;s Griff&apos;s crate?
*Reach for the release mechanism. Forget the others; you just want off this bloody ship.*
*Kemm looks about, then returns his eyes to you and gives you an imperious nod.*
Burning Arrows
Overpower Skillbook
The Beast of the Sea returned to the dwarven kingdom -
Two-Handed Axe
Remember, Lohse: What comes next is for you and you alone. If another Godwoken surpasses you, you&apos;ll have no control over what comes next.
You&apos;ve changed your mind, haven&apos;t you! You do want to make a deal - my freedom for yours!
I will not stand by while you interfere with my darlings! Cease, or there will be consequences!
*Rhalic smirks and releases you.*
Most people are idiots, old boy. Spend more time among them and your capacity to be surprised will quickly vanish.
Francisco Hookbeak
I do too.
Venombite
Frolie, we gotta go! This one&apos;s crazy!
*You obeyed him once already. You may as well again. Do as he commands and kiss his feet.*
Get out of here. We got things under control.
The Hollow Marshes
Jump to a conclusion, and you might fall off a cliff. People do what they do for a lot of reasons; there might be more to this story.
*Announce that you&apos;ve had a change of heart, and reach for your weapon.*
His was a terrible story, that leaves few of us covered in glory. But the story, at least, is over. And yours goes on. For that, I&apos;m grateful. I pray we do not make the same mistakes again.
*The memory comes to you - deep underground, in the home of the children and the trolls, sits the painting that completes the triptych.*
*Turn to take your leave.*
Well... that was certainly &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;.
*But then the image shifts and you see her in another place entirely. A city... A cathedral...*
*Say you&apos;re intrigued by the colour of his skin. How come he is red?*
Fight Theme Oud
*You remember Roost telling campfire tales of a Lone Wolf who lived in a graveyard, in a mansion protected by talking doors. Ryker, his name was, if you recall correctly. And from the tales Roost told, he sounded like a lunatic.*
Queen Justinia&apos;s orders, of course! Can&apos;t really say more than that to you. No matter &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;closely you&apos;re related to Baron Whatshisface.
*Wonder why the Magisters reacted so strongly to him having the scroll.*
Magister Leadership in Driftwood
Be careful, and become the saviour of all lizards, Red Prince. Become the true emperor of your people.
What a shameful act!
*Keep distracting the White Magister. She should tell you all about this Hannag...*
[IFAN] *Tell Alexandar he will never &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; know what you intend. Consume his Source.*
Spend 1 extra AP for every action.
By whose hand - &lt;i&gt;yours? &lt;/i&gt;It should have been my own axe to slice her neck. Take me to her bones; I&apos;ve a mind to chop them into pieces, the foul witch.
*Ask him what word he seeks.*
Accept
Skullcap
To the Lady Vengeance
There&apos;s nothing inna chest! So don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
*Ask where exactly it came from.*
Crafted by the hands of a wizard and emanating an eerie glow, this staff holds as much potential as you hold within yourself.
Bed
We found a letter from Isbeil, Justinia&apos;s advisor. Deathfog is being shipped to Arx, and the Queen may be a puppet of the God King.
Sebille... The &lt;i&gt;scarred&lt;/i&gt; one. The woman bearing the mark of infamy.
Nothing makes sense, and right when I most need it to.
Tiger Form
Oh, I think of them as little as possible.
*The Divine you thought dead lords over the chamber from a granite throne. He moves to speak, but it&apos;s Vredeman&apos;s voice that next pierces the air.*
I see you... &lt;i&gt;unnnnh...&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m a prisoner, of course. Do you think I&apos;d be sitting here calmly if I was a Magister holdout?
You don&apos;t mind if I have a word with Ms Lohse, do you?
It&apos;s only about one third bad, really. Maybe two fifths, depending on the weather?
*Tell him you want to know how to escape the prison.*
*Take the jar and smash it to pieces, freeing the soul inside.*
*Take your leave.*
We face Murga, the champion of the Driftwood arena. If we win we claim her title.
*Ifan smirks and shakes his head.*
*Ifan frowns, then raises the crossbow again. He lines up a shot at a faraway tree and fires.*
Mmmm. The sweet taste of remembrance. The titillation that is one&apos;s first kiss.
*The unwholesome murk clears... to reveal more unwholesome murk, as if the mirror is lying forgotten at the bottom of a well.*
Before you go, milady, perhaps we could trade? I&apos;ve many desirable trinkets from the &lt;i&gt;ancients.&lt;/i&gt; For the smallest of costs, I tell you. Barely a trifle...
*The great forge is black with the soot of ancient work. Inside is a casting for an ornate handle, flecked with glittering bits of silver.*
*Say you hope to gain great power.*
Geraldine, she turned you into a cow and made you her slave.
*Worst of all, as your own death draws near, you fear in your heart that the God King is right.*
You are so delicious. Please... go west. My master awaits.
Show Unavailable
Believe me, a Prince of the House of War survives his first attempts at assassination in the crib. His mother is not so much his keeper as his bodyguard.
...and Mordus with them.
Poisoned Cup of Tea
*Ask what he did to get himself laid out so badly.*
...kill her!
*She returns the smile with interest, a twinkle in her eye.*
*He flashes an appraising glance at you.*
You honour our ritual, but not our lives. For shame.
*Ask about the consulate. What happened?*
Unlearn
*Snorfle.*
We encountered the Sallow Man - leader of the Black Ring forces on the Nameless Isle.
*You hear a dry cackle from the platform above. Turning, you see a rickety corpse staring down at you.*
Eh? Stop your mouth-noises - no cave for you.
We told the kids the truth about their friend.
The lizard assailant said that Sadha is betrothed to another king. Sadha has vanished and the Red Prince is vexed.
*It&apos;s a domestic. Leave them to it.*
You&apos;re no ordinary traveller, are you? You positively reek of Source. Are you the one responsible for this mayhem surrounding us?
Come now. After all this time you still think there&apos;s no more to me than the needle? How disappointing.
*You&apos;re a little hazy on that. You don&apos;t owe her money or anything, do you?*
*He mumbles a goodbye.*
Provides bonus fire damage.
Highlight a trap, press [IE_ControllerContextMenu], and select &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Disarm Trap&lt;/font&gt;.
What do you want?
[IFAN] *Scoff. Do you &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like a man who&apos;s interested in flowers?*
*Tell her not to bother; he&apos;s just some stir-crazy prisoner.*
*Intense fellow, this one! Keep calm and courteously bid him good day.*
Yes, your Source will be gone. But your sacrifice will mean the salvation of hundreds - thousands!
I prayed at each of seven altars and gave my strength to the Gods.
Don&apos;t even think about it, Tatcher. I&apos;ll see you sent to Fort Joy myself.
[UNDEAD] *Look undead.*
Game Master Menu
She tended to get &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;bored.
She betrayed Alexandar! I&apos;d sooner die than free her.
But I suppose one can only help those who want to help themselves. It was nice knowing you, Lohse.
Lord Arhu is a very busy man - I won&apos;t interrupt him on the whim of a stranger. He&apos;ll make himself available in his own time.
The hammer feels heavy as gold, but tough as tenebrium. When it catches the light, you swear you can flames reflected in its sheen.
Only you know the truth. You and one other - but of him you are free. The God King no longer calls your name. He no longer whispers your shame.
[DWARF] *You&apos;d never leave a fellow dwarf in a place like this. Ask him what happened here.*
*Tell her obedience is part of life sometimes. She shouldn&apos;t take it to heart.*
Leave me alone, Dallis, you nasty woman!
*Take our leave.*
Get off me, and stay off.
Well, isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; rich? Cursed by a coffin and rescued by a dwarfling. The &lt;i&gt;indignity&lt;/i&gt;.
Within each individual lies the power of an empire - of a god. Some choose to ignore it, but others... others choose to seize it, to hone it, to bend it into the tool through which they will claim greatness.
Good morning, lovebirds - holy hells an Undead! Again, Zharat? Really?
Gods, no. Literally.
M-my hands have g-gone numb! Can&apos;t s-stay here!
Be on your way, my lovely. Unless you want to join me for dinner.
*The dwarf looks right through you, no interest whatsoever in making your acquaintance.*
[Translate96_814c1caf-d06e-4afe-990f-aaa29c7e4dd3]
Yeah, it&apos;s real. I seen the one they put on Joe&apos;s mum &apos;fore she got sent to Fort Joy.
Choose target.
Remember what I told you. Betray my trust, and you&apos;ll pay - just like those Magisters did.
You do. Some day.
