Not much. People don&apos;t want to leave town. Can&apos;t blame &apos;em. There&apos;s no safety in solitude.
I don&apos;t need your dirty money. You&apos;re under arrest!
What is it he holds... a tome of prayer, or a tome of judgement?
Right goddamn NEVER! You messed with the wrong dwarf, ya rat! I&apos;ll gut you like I do all them fishes! YAAAHH!!
Sleeping_3
But if I am to honour their memory, I cannot sit here and mope. I must go on for them. For my family.
It&apos;s like this: I didn&apos;t sign up to move Deathfog. Other weapons, even soulforged weapons, sure. But &lt;i&gt;Deathfog?&lt;/i&gt; Absolutely not.
There&apos;s never been much love lost between the Paladins and the Magisters, but this? Brawling in the streets? It will be the end of us all.
Walk In Shadows
Looks like we&apos;re on the Wanted list.
Big Elven Club
Wanting &lt;i&gt;what?&lt;/i&gt;
Messenger Owl
*He looks up at you with a sheepish expression.*
This egg could be precious beyond our understanding... it should be safeguarded.
It ain&apos;t right...
*Tell him you think you&apos;ve got the size of the situation. You&apos;ll be fine.*
It&apos;s not about appeasement. It&apos;s about innocent lives. I can&apos;t let you release the Deathfog!
*He recoils from you slightly, but then his face contorts in fury.*
You... everything is so dark, so grey. But you, you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;bright&lt;/i&gt;.
A Black Ring prisoner told us that the Magisters were searching nearby caverns for ancient relics.
Shite... my hat. Fran! Floatin&apos; miles off the coast by now.
So: Now that my voice is mine again...wanna hear a song?
Massacre the Magisters.
Take good care of her. Bring her somewhere peaceful - don&apos;t disturb the demon within her. There&apos;s no telling what could happen if it breaks free.
*You remember reading a book that mentioned this place.*
Don&apos;t see much good anymore. Some, though. Mostly in... in you.
[1] gives you one extra use of a wand skill.
Gawin
More Voidwoken? It seems our company is much desired.
What...? No, &lt;i&gt;please!&lt;/i&gt; DON&apos;T -
Drunk_3
It is good. I see it.
You&apos;re trying my patience, Sourcerer. Come back to me when you have something to show for yourself.
*Snort* Squeeeee!
*Shoo the rodent away. You don&apos;t want it following you any more.*
There is not one who will choose Divinity. What fools! They have power within their grasps, but they fail to take it. These races truly are inferior. Victory is &lt;i&gt;mine.&lt;/i&gt;
Why&apos;n&apos;t ya take a gander at the goodies I&apos;ve got. Stuff you won&apos;t find anywhere else in camp, procured by special means...
Ah. Another poem about humans, then. Since ya don&apos;t command enough attention &apos;round here.
*The fantatic frowns at the craftmistress, mystified. After a slow blink, his attention returns to you.*
[MYSTIC] *Describe the scene in detail. Even the dead would tremble at the despair you witnessed.*
Lucian, we should tell him the truth.
Owls have been flocking in and out of the Kemm mansion all day. I suppose Lord Kemm is trying to drum up support for his revolt against the Magisters.
*A feeling rises in you - Amadia, telling you to reveal her presence. Trust that feeling.*
HNR!
*Ignoring you completely, Roost turns to face Ifan.*
*Nod and say that is exactly what you&apos;ll do.*
Huge Ring
*Say you&apos;d like to talk about what happened on Adramahlihk&apos;s home plane.*
Move out, &lt;i&gt;ON THE DOUBLE!&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask him to tell you what &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;is first.*
Spirit of Fane
Find the Ancestor Tree.
*Agree to do as she asks.*
Once, when the Ancient Empire stretched across all Rivellon, there was an emperor called Rezha. A good lizard, but a sickly one. Scales flakin&apos; off, eyes buggin&apos; out - that kind of thing.
I&apos;ve use for neither gods nor men. I myself am the island that is my destination, you a mere port along the way I tolerate - for the time being.
Having performed the greatest act of necromancy ever witnessed,
The louder people shout in a god&apos;s name, the duller becomes their understanding of its message. Lucian would be appalled.
I have failed the Gods. The only thing left for me now is nothingness. Please, Godwoken. Consume my spirit. End my shame.
*Express surprise. Doesn&apos;t he know that Ancestor Trees carry within them the spirits of real, living people.*
*The Magister draws his sword.*
Oh what do you want from me? I am not here to gossip and titter about my lords.
A moment years in the making... Soon I will have my vengeance.
Wh- what?
Fight Theme Cello
*With delicate movements of the hands, she casts a spell.*
I denied the Red Prince his union with Sadha. Angry, he left.
Cave Exit
Well, look at that, elf. The Silver Claw is back.
Not run off yet, little mutt? Are you paralysed with fear and awe before Septa the Ineffable? I&apos;ll show you mercy... for now...
And then we rise.
It&apos;s so gratifying when all my hours of arcane studies pay off!
Circle &amp; Highlights
There&apos;s something odd about this ring. More than a simple pledge of eternal love... it appears to have been carved for some specific purpose, like a key.
*The Shadow Prince&apos;s spirit snarls at you, claws at you, but his spectral nails move harmlessly through your body.*
We even had to put one of our own to the sword for disobeying orders. You saw that, didn&apos;t you?
*She extends her arms, reaching towards you with a look of total concentration on her eyes.*
*...and at the last, part of the key to the mountain: Rhalic, Vrogir, and Zorl-Stissa, worshipping the sun.*
Quartermistress Anna... saint of a woman... sometimes throws me some... for... dinner.
Team 3
Alright. Here&apos;s how you help: I can hold the Magisters off, but I can&apos;t put them down. Do this for me. &lt;i&gt;Kill them all.&lt;/i&gt;
You don&apos;t know me, but I know you. The rebellion lives, Marcus.
*A tri-forked tongue licks blood-red lips as she drinks you in.*
You must think I&apos;m dumb as a Wollock.
Oh no need to be jealous, Quercus. Fur maketh not the cat.
*There&apos;s nothing left to say. Turn to take your leave.*
Ghost Deer
*The troll&apos;s spirit has abandoned his attempts to pick up the rock. He now stands looking around, at a total loss.*
Still, I must admit, you were right about the Shield. It proved to be more than adequate.
You can&apos;t use brute strength to open every door, warrior.
The spirit of the One shrinks from defeated souls. You have failed your test. Be gone.
Garrick
Magister Urlan
*A humble builder, when your Source powers surfaced you knew you were in for the Joy. But you ended up here, stolen from your cell. They took you apart in search of your Source. You died screaming.*
Unghh. You need to go... Dallis... after she took me... she did something - my head... I feel like someone&apos;s rummaged their fingers through my skull... Get out, while you can...
*Leave the loopy priest to herself.*
The Nameless Isle had vanished. Although only open water remained, by instinct ships would steer clear. None of the captains could articulate why.
*Ask him to slow down. He&apos;s not making any sense.*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
A simple vintage with notes of almond, cinnamon, and the winemaker&apos;s wasted youth.
*The figure recoils as if struck.*
He&apos;s a demonologist. Jahan by name.
Oh, never you mind. What&apos;s one dress when there are worlds left to conquer?
By Lucian&apos;s locks, how did you cut up your leg so badly?
A gift of forbidden knowledge for my champion. A mere trinket compared to what I will give you.
*Herein, Huwbert recounts an encounter with a pool of blood that rises from the floor and attacks him. He barely keeps his life. Once suspects he loses his lunch.*
I thought I&apos;d seen fear in all its flavours, but I&apos;ve never seen a &lt;i&gt;demon &lt;/i&gt;nervous.
You! Halt! I need to look through your belongings. There&apos;s a common pickpocket straying about.
Finesse
Wear the ring.
*His eyes snap up to meet yours.*
There are signs of Source use in the area. Explain yourself!
Can&apos;t say I&apos;m not disappointed. But... I&apos;ll live.
Cave - Broken Bridge (With Lift)
*The salamander&apos;s tongue flickers - tasting you on the air. It turns towards you, letting out a long, low rumble, followed by a series of hisses and chattering clicks.*
He&apos;s &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;m more alone than ever...
May my wares offer the comfort you crave.
I need a shovel.
*Tell him that whatever happened in the past, in the future you&apos;ll stop the Voidwoken. Together.*
The Eternal now known as Dallis  was a secret advisor to Lucian, and to his successors. For aeons she would walk in the world, and would outlive the peoples, and all, and wander alone amongst the dying stars.
Excellent!
Disconnected from the global chat server
*Resting his kindly face on steepled fingers, Marg eagerly awaits your tale.*
*Nod; you heard it. What&apos;s it supposed to be?*
You may not think it, but I prefer action to dreams, my dear. The Void cannot be turned back on the power of wishes.
I&apos;ll talk to my husband. He loves children so.
*Question what he was doing snooping around Griff&apos;s kitchen anyway.*
*Touchy subject. Leave it at that.*
I would speak with Saheila, my kin.
AP
Measures must be taken to bring you up to speed - one last lesson to sharpen those dull wits of yours...
Yesss. Yes I have. But though the mere sight of that needle may make lesser men void their bowels, bowel-less as I am, and impervious to pain to boot, you fail to impress me.
That&apos;s the welcome the Crossleys give to law-abiding Magisters. Sourcerers, though - they get bathed and fed! Ain&apos;t that right, woman?
Another Seeker! Quick, get the scum!
*Twisted and torn in her heart and her mind, the spirit emits an unbearable desire for it all to be over, for good and forever.*
Not today, I&apos;m afraid. You can see I&apos;ve got quite a powerful ally. Godwoken, in fact.
*Leave her be.*
His appetite grows...
Keep your nose clean.
...my father. The scholar Fane.
And now they want to execute me? Please, you have to help me. I have to get out!
*He looks at you... his lip quivers again... wobbles...*
Dallis used the Aeteran to purge the Wellspring.
None can predict where the winds of fate will take us. But as they have blown you here, please stay as long as you wish.
*Finish his sentence for him...*
*Change the subject - ask if he has anything to trade.*
A wretched little fly in our ointment.
Radiant Aegis
*Respond to Gareth with anger of your own. It is Jonathan&apos;s fault, and he will pay for his betrayal.*
*Tell him you saw him club an innocent kin to death over a few remarks. Murder&apos;s the &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;word for it.*
No! No, no, no. Oh, Amadia. Forgive me...
*Keep your distance and ask how he came here.*
Hah. She sees my trouble, of course. She already knows. And she knows I help you out of here in exchange.
How about sense of honour, lizard - or do you even understand such a thing?
*Ignore the squirrel and walk away.*
*Hold the statue&apos;s gaze, resist its gift... then turn away.*
*Tell him better the Undead&apos;s skull than his own.*
Mihaly put himself at great risk to free me from Magister captivity. We made it clear, but he picked up quite a &lt;i&gt;nasty &lt;/i&gt;wound. We found refuge in this charming hamlet.
You shall make a fine gift to our master. Rather, your skull shall. I have no need of the rest...
Parry Master
Hmm... *tuts* ...no. I don&apos;t think &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;be of much use.
[IFAN] *Say that you have been known to kill on occasion, yes.*
Ah, the fanatical soul. Hunted by Zorl-Stissa&apos;s followers, he fled back to the Outlaw Empress with the Devourer&apos;s words on his lips.&lt;br&gt;
Pallid Frostweaver
Close your eyes.
