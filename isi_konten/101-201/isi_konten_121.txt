It&apos;s so shtrange... moving my own lipssh. Feelink my own sshkin. I need to get... used to it.
A target was marked for death. You start taking damage if the target does not die before this status expires.
Walk away then. I&apos;d expect nothing less from someone as evil as you are.
The story of the Outlaw Empress continues to pit historians against one another. Many believe she is a myth, while others claim she is the only explanation for a bizarre civil war in the Ancient Empire starting approximately 450 A.R.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some elements are consistent among the tales: she was a ruthless warrior of the desert tribes, uniting hundreds under her banner. Her combination of charisma and heresy drew the attention of the Empire, who reacted with outrage at her plans to conquer the throne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All record of her disappears after this point, although one exiled scholar declares that she was assassinated by the House of Shadow. Remnants of her cult claim that she lived on in her dragon-bone armour, devouring souls to grow her strength and be reborn. Fanatics are prone to fantasy, of course. After so many centuries, we may never discover the truth.
Fair horizons.
*The battered dwarf pulls her lips back into a garish, open-mouthed grin, flashing blood-stained teeth.*
Listen, then. The Shriekers keep watch. We must silence them with a Purging Wand. Without one, we cannot take the Lady Vengeance.
Debt Collector
Palisade Gates
Dragonstwine
*The tree&apos;s spirit embraces its putrid host. An elven ancestor, lost to the same demonic disease that infests all of Bloodmoon Island.*
Only a fool would decline such a rare chance. You&apos;re no fool - I can tell by your hair cut. Think it over, won&apos;t you?
I can&apos;t think. I can&apos;t clear that damned fog...
Jitterbug
*Tell the ghostly skeleton he looks even more dead than you&apos;d expected.*
*You don&apos;t like this one bit. Slap away Tovah&apos;s hand.*
Good!
&lt;i&gt;&apos;The slave. Take her. The slave. Take... take... the slave...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
*Admit that you would like him to join your party.*
Pyromancer Guardian
It seems the wounded will pull through. Thank the &lt;i&gt;gods&lt;/i&gt;.
I- I- I didn&apos;t mean anything! The God King has promised us thralls of our own, that&apos;s all.
These look like they were never worn but only ever used to smack people around with.
*The heirloom is silent once more.*
*Gareth winks farewell and hums to himself. You don&apos;t recognise the tune, but you imagine it to be a hymn praising Lucian.*
*Ask if she&apos;s interested in trade.*
The stew...? You&apos;re saying that the cook did this?! I never would have eaten food prepared by a filthy &lt;i&gt;elf&lt;/i&gt;... I never would have found out...
Sturdy Chopper
RAUUUUGHHHHHHHH!
Warfare
*A voice that is not your own rises within your skull.*
Am I the only one who thinks this is dangerously close to necromancy?
*Shrug and pretend you don&apos;t remember him at all.*
Aloysius Whitefeather
*Say you&apos;re looking forward to meeting the real her some day.*
I&apos;m here to hunt, remember? Here to play a game of tic-tac-terminate with a special certain someone.
Feh! Fend for yourself then, sweetheart. I&apos;ll take what I want after the Reds get to you, anyway.
Stun Immunity
*Sigh.* I guess I&apos;ll have to face herself instead then. She won&apos;t be happy. Better get fishing then. A bit o&apos; gold for dinner at the tavern might soften the blow. Wishin&apos; you a better day than mine, stranger.

Troll - Any
*She smiles and hugs you so tightly you think your bones may break.*
Scorched earth... with scorched souls to follow.
The Dreamer knows, he passeth by, chased by shadow...
*The spirit of the warrior storms right past you, his axe raised over his head. Suddenly you hear the echo of a &lt;i&gt;shriek...*&lt;/i&gt;
Sewn Scale Pants
Gareth is back! Gareth is safe!

&lt;i&gt;You e&apos;er hear the wild Beast jus&apos; sails on the ocean?&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s docked in the bay and comin&apos; your way!&lt;br&gt;Off in the yon you hear the commotion,&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s docked in the bay and comin&apos; your way!&lt;/i&gt;
High Tier Blank Air Skillbook
*You close your eyes and hear the great ancestral heart beat, louder and louder, in unison with yours.*
As for me... I was freed of one covenant, only to be enslaved once more. But I am fortunate. I serve Master Fane now. My task - to chronicle the rise and fall of the Godwoken. This was their story. Master, I hope you approve.
Amulet of the Dead
Alright then. Anyone else want to step up &apos;n&apos; prove themselves?
...so tired of these mongrels.
Character is immune to Slow effects and has increased physical resistance.
I&apos;d wring Mordus&apos;s neck if I still had the body for it...
The God King? But... but why?
Kayla McNait
This bouquet&apos;s mine...
We want each other after all.
*Say that you&apos;d like to trade: what is she after?*
Wanted Poster
Really? It&apos;s a good story...
*Look at him with incredulity. After all that&apos;s happened today, he wants to &lt;i&gt;kill &lt;/i&gt;his father-in-law?*
Alas, another lost cause. The demon has merged so completely with its host that it is hard to tell which one you are speaking to at any given time.
If that&apos;s the case, let &apos;em show themselves. Lucian, at the very least! All these Reds runnin&apos; the realm for him, and he ain&apos;t even here! Anyhoo...
[JESTER] *Sing the next few lines of the parody version: &apos;A Bloke Sits on Your Pie&apos;.*
*Your fist hits him in the jaw with a sharp crack. It flusters him none, but your hand smarts something fierce.*
We&apos;re waitin&apos; for our friend. He went for a swim. He&apos;ll be back soon.
Arrogance is only arrogance when it masks weakness.
*Ask if the cub happened to notice what was being transported on the cart.*
*Tell her you questioned Roost, but you didn&apos;t bring back any of his flesh.*
Big Dwarven Shillelagh
The Vault of Braccus Rex
*He grins and claps you on the back, full of good cheer.*
*Say that if there can be only One, it will be you.*
Then I came upon the Victory. Nice ship. The royal sailors walked the plank as well as you could hope for. That&apos;s where I found the notes, right there in the open, next to the manifest.
Who lives here? It seems terribly... ordinary.
*Remind her that if she stays, she&apos;ll be at the Divine Order&apos;s mercy. You can take her to safety.*
*Apologise for leaving him behind when the ship was sinking.*
Ha! Oops, I think I broke him.
I like your company, but &apos;trust&apos; is a word for babies and sailors. I&apos;m neither.
To the Heart
A hidden room in the sewers? Past the traps? And the spiders? Not likely! I need to think about this.
Attacking guards in a city is one of the fastest ways to end your journey.
*You catch the soul cleanly between your teeth and swallow it whole.*
Hail, Lord Kemm!
Living Armour
*A look of horror appears on Stubb&apos;s ghostly face - and in an instant he flees for the Hall of Echoes.*
DON&apos;T! Those are demons. Highly dangerous. They CANNOT be freed. Try that again and I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; kill you.
Bock! Bock! Bock!
[OUTLAW] *Offer to lever the collar off with your sharpest blade.*
...he&apos;s got Source in him. Now that his folks are gone, we&apos;ve all he&apos;s got. He&apos;s been stayin&apos; with us. We thought we could keep him safe.
Superconductor Scroll
*Try the dials once again.*
Tell Carver everything you know - we&apos;ve got to catch this killer!
You are... indiscreet. You work with the one known as Jahan. The Doctor does not approve.
At the start of an encounter, you gain one of two statuses: Cycle of Fire and Water or Cycle of Earth and Air. Cycle of Fire and Water increases your Pyrokinetic and Hydrosophist combat abilities by 2. Cycle of Earth and Air increases your Geomancer and Aerotheurge combat abilities by 2. Statuses swap each turn.
*Ask the creature who did this to it.*
Queen Justinia
Once you claim the amulet and the scroll, I&apos;ll explain how to use them.
Disturb the peace, and you&apos;ll wind up in the cells. Understand?
Bottled Inferno
Rat? *Sigh* Just dust bunny.
Tell Lord Kemm that we won&apos;t let this lie. Five hundred and sixty-four prisoners. Five hundred and sixty-four. We &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;let it lie.
*She holds you tighter and kisses your chest, where your heart is.*
Please. Don&apos;t make this harder than it has to be. It&apos;s not your fault, but still you stand in the way of peace. This must be the end of your journey. For the salvation of all Rivellon.
*Nod. You are Rhalic&apos;s chosen.*
Glad you&apos;re with us, Leya.
I&apos;m not risking my life to save no lizards.
*Tell him you&apos;ll go over there and fix his Sourcerer problem.*
Damage dealt depends on your weapon&apos;s damage rating.
What a sleazy deal. Well, you can forget it. You belong in prison.
*...and you realise she&apos;s trying to tell you something.*
Who, if anyone, shall be Divine?
Blood Pact
Painting of a Battle
Food: Fish
*You lean in, a sweet smell wafting around you. The smell of fresh wood, of blooming flowers, of a gentle summer&apos;s night.*
Excellent choice. Now answer me: what are you doing in here?
*You take a deep breath. You have escaped Fort Joy at last.*
Why are you still here? You have a duty! Gather more Source and complete the ritual!
You trying to make a fool of me, boy? Let&apos;s get this over with, then. It&apos;s not as if our little chat was leading anywhere.
I see your guilt. You pay for your sin!
Take the plunge and don&apos;t look back, huh? As good a plan as any, I presume.
Tovah is our hope. Tovah leads the way.
*Fane lets out a gasp and knocks your hands away.*
Oh, I could complain about the food and the lodgings and the sheer barbarity of the common folk, but in truth, all of that fits within the larger frame that is adventure. &lt;br&gt;
This is my investigation, I won&apos;t have the likes of &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;telling me how to conduct it!
*Lohse&apos;s eyes flash black, her skin grey; she looks at you and smiles from ear to ear.*
*Rub your hands together. Time to kick a demon&apos;s face in.*
*She searches your veiled face for the lie. Doesn&apos;t find it in the darkness there. The compliment touches her. She smiles. Reaches for you...*
*You try to tamp it down, but it&apos;s expanding from your belly outward - down into your toes, up through your hands and into your fingertips. A single thought pulses upward into your mind...*
*Scoff and say that would-be slaves have no business engaging professional warriors in battle.*
Join Malady and escape the island.
New Exported Character
*Nod hello. Ask how she came to be injured so.*
*Tell her she and her God King can go to hell... and she&apos;ll be going first.*
Dallis you snake. Where are you hiding...
Another mistake, another tragedy. What have you done?!
You always bring me to such wonderfully destructive places... I&apos;ll never find somewhere quiet to settle down at this rate.
Well hello there, Madame... what was your name again? I&apos;m Lohse.
*Fall to your knees as a sob shakes your chest. Not again...*
The others died... dead bones keep secrets better than any living thing.
Ah, no sense getting riled up about it now. It&apos;s not about me, it&apos;s about... ah, never mind.
The Deathfog attack on the elves strengthened the Void. Things go from bad to worse.
*Nod. Time to destroy a demon.*
*The dwarf&apos;s fingers clamp around a splintered chunk of wood nailed to the skeleton of an old ship. His whole body strains with the effort of wrenching the plank free - to no avail.*
