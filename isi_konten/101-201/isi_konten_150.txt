Murga&apos;s... &lt;i&gt;partic&apos;lar.&lt;/i&gt; She&apos;ll want a talk with you herself before she&apos;ll assent to any challenge. Watch your words, mind. She takes against you? There&apos;ll be &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; talking yourself into her good graces again.
Bah! I should whip her &apos;til she&apos;s as red-skinned as I am, then leave her for the birds to peck clean.
You&apos;re right to question me.
We owe you a debt. If you hadn&apos;t rolled in when you did, I might be whistlin&apos; teedle-dee in a Voidwoken&apos;s belly by now.
Travel beyond...
Besides, like any elf, Tiriara&apos;s head floats in the clouds. They tell wonderful stories, but live fantasies as absurd as any lizard dreamer&apos;s.
[UNDEAD] *Adjust your headgear. She seems fearful; has she noticed something... untoward?*
Ingredients Cupboard
*Press firmly upon the glowing rock.*
Yet another victim...
Fine. I don&apos;t regret it.
Bitten
Lyn and Conway Pryce both died.
Voodoo Ghost Scroll
*Tell him to hang on a minute. Is now really the best time?*
I tried that. It won&apos;t move. It&apos;s too heavy. We need a grownup!
*They begin to hum in unison, a low, rumbling note held over several out-breaths.*
I just wanted to lighten the mood the smallest of scooches. I mean, we&apos;re at the Nameless Isle, one of us is about to ascend to Divinity... and we still don&apos;t know exactly who.
*You understand. Tell Gareth to take the time he needs.*
I still can&apos;t believe the Magisters worked together with the Black Ring.

Your ragged bones think they can admonish us?

*The Eternals doomed themselves. If it were you, you&apos;d live your life and stop worrying about the mistakes of others.*
Nice try, but I can see through your lies. Off to prison with you!
Go. You&apos;re done here.
As one of Lucian&apos;s pawns, I stood for weakness. &lt;i&gt;Frailty. &lt;/i&gt;And then... then the God King showed me the world as it could be. He made me a promise.
Garvan&apos;s head was eaten. Without proof of his revenge, Liam can&apos;t be at peace.
*Hold your tongue.*
Set yourself free Sebille, like you have set us all free!
Mangler
And until Eternity comes for us both, it shall come for neither.
Nowhere&apos;s safe, not while these Void beasts are still appearing...
Miraculous what a Sourcerer can do with a little arcane lore.

*Ask if by &apos;he&apos; the rat means Mordus.*
Alexandar is Rhalic&apos;s minion. Zorl-Stissa would justly disapprove of his candidacy.
&lt;i&gt;Kill him.&lt;/i&gt;
*He shifts uncomfortably.*
My soul. Mine to claim! What remains is yours. Whether your soul can again be whole, Lone Wolf... I cannot say.
Escape? How you do tickle me. Most of the misguided dears around here would argue such a thing is impossible.
Sturdy Crossbow
*Disagree. There are other ways to resolve conflict, and you don&apos;t want to see intimidation like that on your watch.*
I humbly request your pardon, but I do not address lackeys or pack animals. If the head of your troupe wishes to speak to me, they should do so themselves.
*Tell him he&apos;s dreaming.*
I knew Lucian would defend Rivellon from oblivion. I thought he would be equal to the task and easily succeed. It seems I may have been wrong.
Hannag died before she could help us with our Source powers.
Help!
Applies Regeneration.
*You need to learn how to channel more Source. If he helps you, he &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;walk out of this cave.*
*Plead with the squirrel to slow down, take a breath, and explain what it&apos;s talking about.*
There are kin in Arx. Perhaps they could help me find dreamers - and my destiny.
Manifestation of Madness
Do yer bones sail with her, or are ye with us?
Ah, the Empress! Her violence was a work of art. I was enthralled when I watched her. So inspired...
*The ghost turns and tries to run, but your Source is already twisting around it, dragging the spirit towards you.*
The door to Braccus Rex&apos;s ancient armoury lies near the beach, east of Amadia&apos;s sanctuary. What weapons did the Source King keep there?
*You sense a blur of movement to your side. Before you can react, there&apos;s a blade under your chin and a slim, pale hand upon your weapon. A voice whispers in your ear with a breathy purr...*
*He points you towards the nearby temple, where a skirmish continues...*
Large Constitution Potion

We&apos;ll mourn our dead and rebuild. Arx persists.
Mmmm hmmmmmmm.
Black wax? Am I to blame for this?
*Mention that you&apos;re more of a carnation type.*
*Smile and tell her you&apos;ll join her when that day on the beach arrives.*
*Ah, yes. That... Ask for a quick summary.*
*Tell her to stand aside - you&apos;ll go where you please.*
Craft a new Mask of the Shapeshifter.
W-w-w-w-where? H-h-&lt;i&gt;how?&lt;/i&gt; I... I... I...
Yet - I am glad she lives. Her throne still awaits her. And a new home awaits me, I&apos;d like to think.
What a Fuss to have Wrought
I didn&apos;t get the chance to thank you earlier. Without your help against the Voidwoken, things could&apos;ve been much, &lt;i&gt;much &lt;/i&gt;worse. So, er, thank you.

*Ask the trader about his wares.*
This is incredible. I&apos;ve never felt so alive!
He&apos;s back! Gareth&apos;s back! There&apos;s a chance we might actually get out of this alive now...
*Tell her you don&apos;t have any hard evidence.*
Or indeed, any questions beyond &apos;can I eat this?&apos;
*Steer the conversation in another direction.*
[SCHOLAR] *There are strange symbols on these stones. Inspect them.*
Well, isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; rich? Cursed by a coffin and rescued by a stiff in disguise. The &lt;i&gt;indignity&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask why the power of the Magisters would need to &lt;i&gt;negotiate &lt;/i&gt;with one man.*
&apos;Welcome to the City of Arx&apos;
To eat an enemy, to steal their secrets would be... to defile them.
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;BRIGHT WHIP&lt;/b&gt;.*
You have a decision to make. I say give the potion to Geraldine here.
*Wonder if she really thinks you could become the One.*
After we retreated here, our leader, Sir Gareth, set out looking for some ancient weapons that could counter those things. Then we could break the Magister blockade and escape this island.
*Lay your hands on the cool, smooth wood of the altar.*
Mastermastermastermastermaster! Wake! Up!
*You need to know: who is she?*
Get out of here, Lohse. I can&apos;t be seen with you. I&apos;m... sorry.
Hellloooooo?

Keep your shields stacked clean.
xxxhhhnnNNOOO! I was so CLOSE...!
*Sigh.* I should have sold this place when I had a chance, and moved somewhere quiet to spend my twilight years.
*The longing turns sharp, obsessive. You must return to your workshop! As the pangs fade,  someone else lingers near you.*
But wait... I know you, don&apos;t I? Yes, of course...
Still no entry, I&apos;m afraid.
We learned how to brew the potion that turns polymorphed cows back into humans.
Of course... but place your order with Lovrik, out front - I must return to my work...
The Mother Tree is to blame here. It&apos;s no wonder he rebelled.
*Change the subject and ask to see her wares.*
Maybe I should hear your confession, Kemm?
You come to fight. You come to prove yourself. You come to be worthy. There can be only One, and you have but &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; chance...
Trade: Traders&apos; Supplies
No more talking, hear me?! There&apos;s only one way this will end...
Now, do you wish to sharpen your wits?
Not so much. But I do have a sense of humour...

Aye. And I&apos;m sick of listenin&apos; to ye natter.
*The chick&apos;s joyous flutters launch a few stray sparks into the air. It is elated by the very sight of its adopted father.*
*Explain that you&apos;re on his side - you&apos;re the one that sent the owl which warned him about the Magisters and the Black Ring.*
What am I even looking for? Will I know it when I see it...?
*As you begin to hum and match her droning rhythm, her dead eyes swivel to meet yours. The blackness of her pupils grows to fill your vision and the sound in your ears becomes &lt;i&gt;everything.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Watch him. He can&apos;t hurt anyone now - not even himself.*
Go now, Sebille. Rivellon and its Masters await.
Hey, lookit you! Made it off the island, did you? Good for you! Now, where are you hidin&apos; your boss?
*Say you&apos;d love to luxuriate all over her sumptuous slimy self on that most promising of slabs.*
Please! I failed my duty, and let myself be corrupted. Now I&apos;m just a potential weapon to be used against you. Grant me oblivion, I beg you.
Plate Boots
Yes... yes. You&apos;re right. There&apos;s little time for tears. When it is time to sail, I will be ready.
Your lizard lover finally returned to the Ancient Lizard Empire,
I pray he remembers what we were. And what we still might be, should Lucian will it.
Draw Surface
You&apos;ll need the Scroll of Atonement. It&apos;s locked in my desk on the second floor. The password is &apos;Giyora&apos;.
Zzzz...
So powerful that you&apos;ve been overpowered by clowns in red capes and a glowing necklace? Well, colour me impressed!
*Grimace and spit out the wad of rotted flesh.*
Crocodile Die
YOU! &lt;i&gt;Vermin! &lt;/i&gt;Always treading where you are least wanted. &lt;i&gt;Enough.&lt;/i&gt;
Some of us are meant to remain. Some of you are meant to leave. There is a way. You see in time.
*Say you&apos;ve heard enough and take your leave.*
Where is she? WHERE IS SHE? You know who I mean. I need an audience with our Lohse. &lt;i&gt;Now.&lt;/i&gt;
Would you rate your displeasure as great or very great?
*Express surprise. Doesn&apos;t he know Alexandar is gone?*
Bone Cage
Master did!
*Pet the dog.*
F10
*Ask him what he has in mind for the person who did that.*
Freedom! Can you taste the ash on the air? My legacy is reborn.
*Shrug. Maybe you don&apos;t need anything after all.*
*Even after all you&apos;ve been through together, it seems Ifan&apos;s no fan of protracted goodbyes. He simply nods once - throwing you a half smile - before loping away.*
I can&apos;t stay. You shouldn&apos;t, either. What did Lucian say? Ah, yes. &lt;i&gt;&apos;Evil feasts on the indolent.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
You said there were other people down there. We... we need to help them!
*She gives you a long look, considering the request...*
Let&apos;s talk back at the ship. I&apos;m busy here now, for the moment, but we shouldn&apos;t let this linger for too long.
*Repeat: no-one is beyond redemption.*
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;SILVER WHIP&lt;/b&gt;.*
*Tell her you bring news of Gwydian Rince.*
This fortifying brew may reek of sour milk, but one gulp will grant you a minor resistance to all types of elemental magic.
Oh. Erm. Yes. Show me.
Large Iron Bar
&lt;i&gt;The big Magister did this. He didn&apos;t care that I was innocent.. I heard them call him Stamley, as I bled out on the ground...&lt;/i&gt;
*The moment passes. There&apos;s another swish of metal through the air - the spirit collapses backwards; a silver gash opening the full width of her torso.*
