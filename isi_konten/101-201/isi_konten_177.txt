You must realise, Ifan, that our fates are now as one, just as our souls are now as one. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; are &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell her you&apos;re a Sourcerer and Alexandar&apos;s blood is on your hands. You are no friend to Magisters.*
Isbeil&apos;s Laboratory
I underestimated you, Godwoken. You have proven to be a formidable foe. You have my respect.
[DWARF] *Tell him a little plank ought to be no match for a strapping dwarf like him!*
You just don&apos;t know when to stop, do you? Prepare to die!
*No amount of sheer force you exert can budge the slab even a hair&apos;s breadth.*
*Step aside. Tell them to go right ahead.*
Invite Only
*Ask where he heard about that.*
Nnggh... I better try clean this wound...
Judge
&lt;i&gt;Tsk tsk.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say it&apos;s about earlier. On the boat. When you had a moment alone with one of the team.*
I saw what you did there. Convincin&apos; Burro not to lay down the law on that elf. Your kind stick together like stink on garbage, don&apos;t you.
[SCHOLAR] *Question his approach. Did he try reasoning with Justinia?*
*Shake your head. You&apos;re not going to do it.*
Using Magic Scrolls
I decided not to travel to the demon&apos;s home plane. I&apos;ll face him here, as he is.
*What does it mean? Who drained it?*
Empty Potion Bottle
*Whistle along with him. Things aren&apos;t looking good.*
Must find it, must find it, must find it...
But I know one thing - I may be the last of my line, but the hope for my people lives on through me. I must try to save them.
Yes. You&apos;re right. It wasn&apos;t a burden I was ready to bear. Thankfully, I&apos;ve had time to think. My parents led good lives. I&apos;d rather celebrate them for the love they gave me than to wail over their loss.
Travel, they said. See all the wonders of the world, they said.
I taught that boy right. Taught him to fear the Divine&apos;s hand. Taught him &apos;til he was black and blue and cross-eyed.
Jewellery Upgrade
*Tell her that you don&apos;t need some wand to kill Magisters. You&apos;ll do just fine.*
A magical, mysterious dye that can turn mere cloth scraps into something... out of this world!
*Say you&apos;re looking for an elemental powerhouse - a Wizard will do.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca] gold)
Something has these creatures agitated, and they do not seem prone to fear. I, however, am quite ready to be terrified.
Excavations. Digging out old weapons. More- urgh... more Purging Wands. Enough to turn the tide against Source.
Magister Document about The Mistake
But threatened by the Void, they rise together...
It would mean &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. The One will prove himself above all others.
I&apos;m sorry. We can&apos;t do business unless you pay the man downstairs.
My eye you got lost! What are you &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;doing up here?
Francesca
Whether we&apos;re any safer on this beach remains to be seen.
This is not the real Lohse.
You&apos;re on thin ice, mate. And I&apos;m very close to cracking.
On the contrary, I expect to be rewarded! But not in the same way as you. Come, let me show you...
Donate
*Remark that Dallis put him through a lot - if he wants revenge against her, then he&apos;d be wise to be honest with his new allies. You could all help each other.*
*Sharply command him to come to his senses! You seek answers, not riddles.*
*Black Cat blinks awake and looks right into your eyes, purring.*
*Back off.*
They&apos;ll tear &lt;i&gt;us &lt;/i&gt;down if we don&apos;t stay quiet!
Mmhmm! I bet you are. That&apos;s why you left me to drown, right?
I make that it&apos;s one fine instrument. As soon as I&apos;m able, I&apos;m gonna play the hell out of it. Something that&apos;s made with love always sounds the sweetest, and you can tell Fingal loves her work.
*Scowl. Zaleskar you presume? Griff told you you&apos;d find him here.*
Please, no more!
I think I&apos;ll take this one to the grave with me. Or... wait. You know what I mean.
Doll
They say one of the pilgrims endured the Path of Blood. I didn&apos;t think anyone had it in them, honestly.
Farewell, Mistress. Our paths diverge here.
Let&apos;s get outta here!
You&apos;ve had your fun. Bugger off.
You&apos;re covered with the stink of Source. We&apos;ve got prison cells just for your sort!
*The spirit&apos;s tail flickers in unabashed delight.*&lt;br&gt;
Gareth. He&apos;s... gone. His face and voice now just memory...
*Blink. You&apos;re not sure that&apos;s a real number...*
We&apos;re... we work to protect Source, and its most gifted wielders. We&apos;re looking for Sourcerers with... special talents.
*Say you seek to see a debt repaid.*
That doesn&apos;t matter. Let the rest of the world worry about right and wrong, good and evil.
[The smeared ink makes the journal difficult to read, but you manage to make out much of the latest entry.]
*She gives you a steady look that tells you she&apos;s not in charge... and neither are you.*
Besides, not like Alexandar is a delicate little innocent, now is it? You&apos;ve seen &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;work.
Not much to say ya can&apos;t figure out on your own. The Magisters run most o&apos; the show, but they leave us alone down here. Mostly. Then there&apos;s Griff. Collared like the rest of us but a bully all the same.
*Say that you feel... great!*
Thou art back... Let me guide thee, Red Prince...
*The dog looks sadly at you, then looks away. The cat looks at you, sighs, and... seems to... &lt;i&gt;shrug.*&lt;/i&gt;
Sir Lora
Corrosive Spray Scroll
Been nice knowing you Ifan, but you&apos;re a goner now, no matter what. And I might as well be the one to collect on the contract...
Dungeon - Empty Room (Square Stairs)
*Produce the blade you found in the archives.*
Fair enough. But the longer you wait, the more the Void may swallow. Stay vigilant.
*His eyes narrow... and then he smiles&lt;i&gt;.*&lt;/i&gt;
There&apos;s bad things in the caves. Bad dwarf things.
*Look around and say he must feel very proud of how the Divine Order turned out.*
Well, not nothing. I have enough to buy your silence forever.
*It was nothing. Wave your hands and walk away.*
*Holding a bloodied hand over his ruined eye, Stingtail stands before you a broken mess, quivering with fear and pleading miserably to spare his life.*
*Request that he repeat what he told you about your reward - this fish recipe...*
Teleport Disappear
Magisters colluded with Black Ring! Paladins clean house!
See that you are. If I so much as catch a whiff of that demon of yours, I&apos;ll put you down myself.
Find your stolen stuff.
Still with the lies, Marcus? Brought Justinia nothing but harm then, and will bring nothing but harm now. You are no beast - you are &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than beast. You serve&lt;i&gt; no &lt;/i&gt;purpose, spread &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; warmth, bear&lt;i&gt; no &lt;/i&gt;burden.
Key to the Chest in the Doctor&apos;s House
I suppose we&apos;ll see about you. If we ever make it out of here, that is. But before that, I&apos;ve got the injured to see to.
My sisters and I make trinkets. I tagged along with the Seekers for safe passage to sell them, but now - now there&apos;s nowhere for me to go.
[IFAN] *Tell him a scrap metal merchant&apos;s got no place in battle.*
*Ask what else she can tell you about Ryker.*
*Keep a straight face as you express your astonishment - a Sourcerer! &lt;i&gt;Here?!*&lt;/i&gt;
[HERO] *Reach out and take &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the straws from Kinnet.*
*No. This is a bridge too far. There is a limit to your subservience, even to a god!*
Now that you have that *cough* that delightful little nugget of gossip, perhaps you could do your damn job and let me loose?
Fran! My hat! Dammit. Floatin&apos; a few good miles out by now.
So! Still a bit groggy are we? Don&apos;t worry, the sedative will wear off soon enough.
Noxious Void Salamander
The Princess... she will take your life... she will EAT YOUR SOUL.
*His face grows stern; disbelief apparent in his eyes.*
Tell me, where will you go from here?
The future of the lizard race stands before us. We will fight the God King - and we &lt;i&gt;will win.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you&apos;ll always be back for a little more Lohse.*
To liberate the elves, Saheila wants the Mother Tree dead. Do we help her?
*Ask if there&apos;s any way you can help him.*
By all the hells, what happened?!
*Tell her she ought to have a look around with you. You can watch each other&apos;s backs.*
*Show him your charity once more.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*The world shakes, and a set of draconic fangs impale you. They rip into your insides, digging deep as they can.*
Locked
Fish
More wax? Another soul, snuffed out with a single breath...
&lt;i&gt;Fear not, Godwoken. Dallis is on the side of all that is good. She is helping me rid Rivellon of the influence of the Source. Listen to her.&lt;/i&gt;
We found a bloodied Magister&apos;s ring hidden in the kitchen at the Black Bull.
*Ask him what he&apos;s talking about.*
*As your palms press the warm stone, you feel the depths of your being crack open. Power flows from you into the relic.*
Ah! You truly are my saviour. This won&apos;t be my first bowl today, but I&apos;m certainly hoping it&apos;ll be more rewarding than the last.
Mine started out tough at first too, but it sure did get better.
You think you can poach my contract? You should know better, old boy. This whole place is a trap... and you&apos;ve just sprung it.
This again. You know, I could really do without the... the &lt;i&gt;attitude.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask him how he does that glint-in-the-eye thing. Is it a trick of the light?*
Return to the Watcher.
Congratulations to our champion!
I&apos;d tell you that was a nice try, but I&apos;d be lying.
This isn&apos;t the paradise I expected. Much hasn&apos;t been as I expected.
This is the worst day of my life.
Sailfish
Might sound crazy to ya, but that&apos;s just the way of it. Ya battle in the arenas. You get divine power if ya come out on top.
Moving to orifice manipulator!
...but I see now that my prejudice was foolish. Without you, Quercus and I might still be stuck on that abominable prison island.
*Rub your hands together; feel the energy that swells between your palms.*
Wait. I can hear it. I can hear it in every rustle underfoot, every breath you take.
*Say that what&apos;s done is done; only &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;was destined to survive.*
Almira
Divinity itself: by all means I crave it.
Green Tea Leaves
*Shake your head - idealism exacts a price. A very high price: consume the spirits&apos; Source, all in one go.*
Ahhh! I can feel my Source powers draining at the merest touch of that fuligin metal.
Ha! Sharp eyes, lad.
*Thank her for her time, then leave.*
*Raedalus awakens as if from a daze. He takes what would have been a breath, were he still alive, and breaks into a run...*
I can&apos;t. Not yet. First, you must look into my ring and tell me what you see there.
Alexandar&apos;s advisor Dallis noticed that the Voidwoken are attracted to Source. Alexandar quarantined the Sourcerers.
was a secret advisor to Lucian, and to his successors.
*Ask if this is why she remains masked at all times. To hide her true self?*
End it here and now. The queen&apos;s continued rule will only lead her people to ruin.
If you help us, then I&apos;ll help you, my dear. Reciprocation is important to me.
[IFAN] *Tell him you found evidence of Deathfog in the cave. Say that you have experience with Deathfog. &lt;i&gt;Bad&lt;/i&gt; experience.*
Thank you, Lohse. Here, we are one. Invincible in our bond, invincible in my black haven. Isn&apos;t it &lt;i&gt;perfect?&lt;/i&gt;
The vault was Kemm&apos;s shrine to the God King - and Arhu&apos;s prison. Now it is neither.
