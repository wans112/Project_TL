Nothing to see here. Not even today.
*Turn your back on the child.*
Yet time has come to ease our daily grind...
Gwydian is safe. Perhaps... perhaps the Gods have not abandoned us. At least, not yet.
Can you go in the water? I wasn&apos;t aware you fellas were ambidextrous. Well, if you fancy a paddle you can go right ahead.
The Voidwoken came, and killed all within reach. The fires consumed the rest... it was pointless to try and face them in the waking world, so I brought the Princess here for safety.
*She manipulates the ring around your neck in several quick yet intricate motions. Off pops your collar, and a sense of relief swirls from deep within you.*
Blood Storm Scroll
But now they&apos;re just... gone. Because of me. Because of this... thing I am. And the Magisters... they&apos;ll come back. They always do.
Tell me. Have you ever been in love?&lt;br&gt;
*Kick it off. Reach through the light, grab hold of what is beyond...*
No taxpayer coin has touched it in a hot century!
Please, help!
Elf Prisoner
You bite off more than you can chew, fool. Ready yourself!
I won&apos;t lie. This will be rough, Lohse. Our foe is a true arch-demon. We know him now. Adramahlihk.
Hunter&apos;s Talisman
Speak with Betty.
I think we&apos;re the lone survivors...
*Nod to his insignia. What does it represent?*
You have my sympathy.
I won&apos;t let the fallen be forgotten. I&apos;d be no better than Dallis, no better than Alexandar, if I just tossed their remains into the sea.
That looks dangerous, but maybe I can disarm it.
If you ever need anything of me, please, you have only to ask.
You take care now. Can&apos;t be too careful &apos;round here!
*Ask where the weapons are now.*
Good riddance. Thought that one would never shut up.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;Here rests the Human Hero, Garrick. He served Lucian the Divine with immense skill, and slew the necromancers who preyed upon the dead of Stonegarden Cemetery. The implements of his heroism shall rest at the site of his victory.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
*She nods an uninterested greeting.*
Alien Tormented Soul
Bloody lad. Flappin&apos; his gums in the next life, too. That&apos;s another little venture of ours. Don&apos;t concern you though.
*Say that she would have refused too, if she knew what they asked in exchange.*
*Try the word out. Godwoken. Somehow you&apos;d already suspected you were... different.*
Leya&apos;s safe back at the shelter, thank the Divine... she&apos;s not up to facing the Magisters again... not now...
This machine drips with poisonous slime.
Death is a constant risk for all who serve with the Magisters - I won&apos;t apologise for doing my duty! Now, this sordid business is ended...
You feel the power of your allies praying to you. Their devotion is providing you with infinite Source.
*Tell him there&apos;s no universe in which you could be considered his darling.*
Right. Well. Good luck with that... *Sips.* ...O Divine One.
Copper Pendant
[ELF] *Ask how Tiriara responded.*
I like an elf who knows what she wants and isn&apos;t afraid to take it. You&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. But let&apos;s take it slow. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
Actions
Deal with the child and her cat.
The undead priestess Gratiana remained in her sanctuary, happy to wait for the war to pass. She was troubled only by the silence of her goddess.
Now let&apos;s see an end to these useless gnats, shall we?
So you eliminated the butcher responsible, I presume? You have earned your swagger, my good man.
They do this to themselves! I warn them!
Once, this was true. But alas, now...
Is this... the Seeker leader? Another casualty on this tragic island. The Magisters are writing a violent story here.
Duggan
Gods be buggered, FINE! I&apos;ll tell! I&apos;ll tell you all I know!
Character Creation
*Admit to using Source.*
*Say you can&apos;t stop picturing him in a codpiece now.*
I don&apos;t know what just happened but I do know that I CAN&apos;T TASTE ANYTHING! And that is the WORST FEELING IN THE WHOLE WORLD!
*Tell him you hope he feels better.*
Nabbed the key off that Kraus fella up above. Not the brightest of the Magisters. Would stick &apos;is head in a pig&apos;s arse and call it a hat. Reckon it unlocks one of the doors to the prison, though not sure which.
The sewer&apos;s running as red as the street.
*As Mrazxken, two revelations hit you in quick succession. The first - you&apos;ll never know the answer to the question &apos;What is the Universe?&apos; The second - you don&apos;t care. And then you are gone.*
Report back to the Sallow Man.
Seeds
That isn&apos;t good enough. I have to have a guarantee. And only I can guarantee it.
Rain Skillbook
Dungeon - Empty Room (Small Square)
For they will all walk the same path as you, but they cannot be allowed to reach its end. You must be the one. Only one of our people can wield this power. Only &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, Fane.
Sir, yes sir! I&apos;ll do that sir. And I&apos;ll go find my mum!
Cat bought the lot for a considerable sum, and then left.
*Tell her to mind her own business.*
*Leave it to its food.*
Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh? Only thing I like less than Black Ring are trolls.
Enemies to the left, foes to the right. Just close your eyes and swing.
*Deep within you, you feel something change. Your soul opens up, and you feel it swell as new channels for Source start to flow through you.*
Trying to skulk away, are you? Guards - this one is a spy, an infiltrator - KILL HER!&lt;br&gt;
Magical Lute
*The skeleton stares at you, mouth agape.*
[MYSTIC] *Cry out to the God King. You reject his will. &lt;i&gt;This is not his dominion!*&lt;/i&gt;
Not my eggs, our eggs! All the family, all the eggs, every last one! Big Marge saw. Big Marge will tell you everything!
*Give her a concerned frown. You&apos;re glad someone&apos;s looking out for the young ones.*
Lo, gecko! Bow before Septa the Ineffable - bow before it&apos;s too late!
Shain
I killed Alexandar. To gain access to the Council of Seven, I must be the last Godwoken alive.
*A tremendous power enters your body all at once, as though you dropped yourself suddenly into a pool of water. You are soaked through with energy, with light.*
I&apos;m from the deserts of Mezd originally. My parents died when I was very young, no more than a cub.
English
Are you ready to join forces?
Learn the details of Ifan&apos;s contract.
The sinking of the orc fleet. The destruction of the Shadow Tower. The failed assassinations of the Godwoken. The petrification of no less than four succubi. All of these failures can be attributed to the same demon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S. wants you to uncover his name and bring him to heel!
Meowowowowowowwww!
I have given you what you asked, and still you&apos;d slay me? Very well. Let&apos;s dance, elf.
Thanks! You&apos;re probably looking for a reward, but I haven&apos;t got much. Except, you know, &lt;i&gt;the wisdom of the ages.&lt;/i&gt;
*Sigh. This isn&apos;t getting you anywhere.*
Duna feels the pull of the Moon.
*Fight the urge with all your might.*
One who can either rise to this great task... or let her people fall to ruin.
*Nod as if you know what he&apos;s talking about, then turn away.*
If you are wondering what just happened, don&apos;t ask. There was magic I witnessed, and magic was forced upon me. Yet it could all be an illusion still.
Then get to work right quick, yow wolf, and earn yore keep - the Order sends its swine, and yow must help us kill them. &lt;i&gt;Move, merc!&lt;/i&gt;
[JESTER] *Pretend to slip and drop the crossbow, deftly catching it just before it hits earth.*
Not really the end you hoped for, but at least it got resolved.
*Pull close. Run your hand along his beard to smooth it out.*
Wait, what is this? You lying- You said you&apos;d get me out!
*Declare that you&apos;ve changed your mind.*
Hauberk
...and I also want to take another trip on your party box. Is that so wrong?
Earth-covered Chest
Coldhearted... but perhaps wise. Do what you must to fulfill your destiny, Godwoken.
I&apos;m not doin&apos; business with the likes of you.
Yet here you stand, your spirit sworn to him, bound to serve his whim in the world to come. Do you suppose you are any more infallible than me?
*You reach your hand towards the device and your inner Source is stifled, as if you&apos;d never rid yourself of that cursed collar.*
*Slam into the door with all your strength.*
*Ask who this advisor is.*
*The cub sadly watches you go. It sniffles. Sobs. Mewls. Sighs. Then whispers...*
*Fane lays a bony hand on your shoulder, squeezing gently.*
What... what happened?!
Sliver
Please, good sir. You must free me! Prise this spear from my chest, where it has been stuck fast the last thousand years.
*He trails away. Falls silent. The flames crackle on.*
*Your Source link to Kari is suddenly severed. Her spirit stands before you, head bowed. She offers only two words in reply.*
*Tell him not to be afraid. You know lots of songs and stories... and you can teach him how to do a cartwheel!*
An old Lone Wolf colleague of mine in disguise: Callo. He&apos;s hunting Godwoken, but don&apos;t worry, I didn&apos;t tell him our little secret.
Saeva the Many-faced
There&apos;s more blood down there than water.
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there, pretty. Jonathan&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt he&apos;ll be caring much who or what he slices.
I was tricked into killing the elves. And Alexandar regrets nothing.
No, no... not that. &lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt; Anything but that!
Royal Protector
Exquisite Vest
My prince! With your every step toward me, my heart beats more happily!
*Laugh at his plight. You can&apos;t wait to see his face when the Magisters pull him out of that barrel.*
You&apos;ll have to wear a collar again, by the by. Nothing you&apos;re not used to.
See that heap o&apos; bark? S&apos;what happens when you cross Griff. The other newbies are catching on fast. You oughta do the same.
Honour mode
Now: Was that all?
If yeh&apos;re looking for a man with a plan, yeh&apos;ll need to talk to Gareth.
Spit poison in front of you, dealing [1].
Diplomatic Actions
Halfway to greatness; a little heat will take this simple meal to new heights.
By all means, milady. Speak!
Yeah. I&apos;m ready. I hope you are, too. I think -
*No. You long for her so.*
Walk ever in Amadia&apos;s grace, child.
Peacebringer
Hmm. Well.
Don&apos;t just stand there. Untie me!
We demand you be the heart!
Venom Coating Skillbook
*He turns back to his work. You feel the weight of his key in your hand.*
Maybe some children belong in the sewers.
Like I said, you&apos;re free to go. &lt;i&gt;Don&apos;t let me see you in here again.&lt;/i&gt;
Mordus? I thought he were under lock &apos;n&apos; key. Never was sure why Lohar&apos;d put any trust in him. All creepy and weird. Not the trustworthy kind, if ya catch my drift.
As do I it seems. Whatever that life might be...
[OUTLAW] *Say that you are on the side of whoever&apos;s paying the most.*
I wasn&apos;t sure about you back on the ship, but I think I&apos;m starting to like you, lady.
Oh, how precious of you! You know running only makes it all the more fun for me.
Blessed Fire
Lucian, wait your turn, I shall devour your soul anon. Now &lt;i&gt;you, &lt;/i&gt;who dares interrupt Braccus Rex...
Zombies - Any
*Tell her you&apos;re no Magister. In fact, you&apos;ve been invited here by a certain Sir Gareth. Ring any bells?*
