*The archeologist led his crew for months, digging for a beast&apos;s bones. His Empress needed them to forge a set of armour.*
Existential Haze
*Nod and say that you&apos;ve made it as safe as you can.*
Hard to say. That mad doctor Isbeil&apos;s the one who pulls the queen&apos;s strings. No idea who&apos;s pullin&apos; hers.
I fear the future if our trees do not take root - our lands fell beneath the mists of death, and many trees are lost. Without our trees we too, we elves, are lost.
[SEBILLE] *Ask if there&apos;s something nasty in the chest.*
I appreciate your candour, but please, have a little discretion. I would hate for my new family to get the right idea.
[LIZARD] We write history as we go along. History shall remember the city of Arx&apos;s proudest sacrifice. They shall be heroes, and so shall we.
*What follows though is far from peaceful: they claw and thrash as if struggling for dear life, caught in the hold of some hideous nightmare.*
&apos;ey up, well alrighty then. For the best, I&apos;m sure. &apos;sides, I only ever really needed three lovers: my hat, my beard, and the sea!
You should speak to Lovrik if you want some.
It&apos;s not a very dramatic stunt, but kids like it, and it doesn&apos;t freak out their parents. But I presume you&apos;re after something a little more... sensational, no?
Anyway, what&apos;s dead is done, so let&apos;s move on shall we? Despite my high hopes, this scar disfigures me still.
*Suddenly, the child&apos;s face crinkles into a grimace. She seems on the verge of sobbing when her face suddenly goes still and blank. She smiles at you and continues her game.*
I&apos;m a man of my word.
Poutine
*Demand that he explain what he means by &apos;the likes of you&apos;.*

*...and you gasp as you are thrust into the present. You take a few deep heaves, then glance at the spirit. Her mouth continues to gabble, but you&apos;re grateful that only silence reaches your ears.*
We found the Swornbreaker.
Or, indeed, you could stand there gawping as if I&apos;d just told you I was wearing your queen&apos;s undergarments.
If this turns out to be the moment I lost the Master&apos;s scent, you &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; answer for it.
*You&apos;re intrigued by his ruler. Ask what an Eternal King is like.*
Secret Document
She disobeyed orders. She knew the consequences. I expect she shall receive justice.
Decorative Elven Sword
[BARBARIAN] *You have an idea. Tell him you want his sword.*
&lt;i&gt;We only lack yours.&lt;/i&gt;
I imagine it&apos;s quite hard for you to fathom. I don&apos;t suppose I&apos;d look forward to this fate, myself. But you must understand - if your kind are left well enough alone, &lt;i&gt;the Voidwoken will destroy us. &lt;/i&gt;All of us.
I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; you, Ifan. You can&apos;t hide your true self from me. Just as I cannot hide from my own fate.
Stick with me and I&apos;ll introduce you to my pack leader: Roost. He doesn&apos;t take all comers and you&apos;re certainly a sly fish, but... you never know.
*Fine. You&apos;ll use magic on the rat.*
You must be sure. The Devourer rules his dream, and will trap us there until he is defeated.
Imperator
*Relent. You&apos;ll find the rest of Anathema.*
Damn it, he&apos;s even more cunning than we knew. Very well, thank you for your efforts. Fruitless as they were...
It&apos;s hard to see her like this. She was so... &lt;i&gt;fierce&lt;/i&gt;. We wouldn&apos;t have made it this far without her.
Equalise Scroll
I rather have the feeling we didn&apos;t do right by this poor fellow. His death could have been avoided.
You&apos;re not half bad, are you, chief.
Despite its honourable past, this is a standard-issue military lance; no surprises here, from its sturdy wood to its gleaming spike.
I would. But I&apos;m having far too much fun here.
*Whisper that you&apos;re here to find a Seeker matching her description. You need her alive...*
There shall be a new Divine, and he shall be a kin... There shall be a new Divine, and he shall be a kin... There shall be a new Divine, and he shall be a kin..
Dwarven Crossbow
Soundin&apos; like a livin&apos; hellspawn has its advantages though. I can make a man shit his pants just by sayin&apos; &apos;boo&apos;.
My goodness. Here we are, Quercus. This is it.
Ungh. Don&apos;t. Say. Anything.
The dread king will burn. My child will be the all-consuming fire!
Nice try.
Before he died, he arranged for the Lone Wolves to hunt and harry any rumoured Godwoken until they were dead or banished to the ends of the world.
*Groan.*
Did he sacrifice others as Lucian had done?
*The creaking of the ship beneath you ceases, as if it were awaiting your decision with bated breath...*
The witch Radeka! I was in love with her once. For the smallest slight - really, a trifle - she wielded a Purging Wand against me, enslaving me to her will. Now, only my voice remains my own.

*Give her an easy smile. You know you can count on her support.*
Enigmatic Figure
*The dwarf chuckles, never turning his gaze away from the window.*
*The spirit of the conjurer looks around in confusion, seemingly oblivious to you.*
Ain&apos;t no-one been standing together since Lucian died! Ain&apos;t been no goodwill among your kind, or mine, or anyone else&apos;s since the Reds been in charge!
[Translate65_6ea82e21-def8-421e-b60b-2ba366512c96]
My good lady, what are you waiting for? The experience of a lifetime awaits upstairs, and the door to you is open.
Pop... is that... is that really you?
*Great malice creeps into his face.*
*Ask if any of her people would be willing to trade.*
Wireless
Sure thing, toots.
*Step forward and demand to know what the queen has to do with this.*
What&apos;s happening? Each time I consume Source, my helmet seems to come alive.
*You are unmoved. Consume his Source and snuff out his soul.*
You know nothing! Nothing of my life. Nothing of the things I&apos;ve seen. Nothing of the things I&apos;ve &lt;i&gt;done.&lt;/i&gt;
I thank you for your blessing.
I... I&apos;m sorry. I don&apos;t know why I did that. I suppose I&apos;m a bit skittish from time to time. Skittish, like a cat that&apos;s seen too much unkindness.
Not Full
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. We&apos;ll never know what was in the chest.
So it&apos;s a story ya want? Well then it&apos;s a story you&apos;ll get!
*Take your leave.*
*Shrug. You don&apos;t intend to explain yourself.*
Spoken to Malady yet? She said to talk to the Lady Vengeance when we&apos;re ready to move on.
Fulton... I&apos;ll find you.
*Pleased with herself, she turns back to her drink. Tatcher gives you an encouraging grin.*
The Magisters bring their war. Destroy our Ancestor Trees. But not all - I escape with spore-armour. And the Ancestor inside teaches me.
*He catches himself and scrapes his throat in a brief moment of embarrassment.*
You are as perceptive as you are effective. I like that! No, I invited you here to make you a... proposition. To offer you a pact of mutual co-operation. Please. Let me help you.

I &lt;i&gt;would &lt;/i&gt;call you a vulgarian, but that would amount to a low blow against vulgarians...
We craft wonders to last through the ages long after your crude tools have rusted to nothing.
Active Search
Feels &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;, doesn&apos;t it?
So, Godwoken, I see you&apos;ve already started down your path to Divinity. Quite the enterprising spirit. So to speak...
*The hound bares its teeth in a drooly snarl.*
*She looks at you expectantly.*
Combustion
*Remark that from the look of him, too much ferocity was had.*
The forces of evil will throw everything they have against us, but I need more time to finish my research.
Your loss, my friend. Your very &lt;i&gt;great &lt;/i&gt;loss.
The wind is a gentle kiss. Come, feel it.
Help, help, help, help, help...
My Companions
Looks like I have to see a man about a wolf in the Hollow Marshes.
Someone will pay for this, if there&apos;s justice in the world.
Am I cursed? Has the goddess turned her back on me?&lt;br&gt;
[RED PRINCE] *Grab her by the throat and sneer that you should do to her what she did to Stingtail!*
*He watches you depart without another word, then turns back to face the sea.*
Impressive, no? There&apos;s a lot of craftsmanship in that small package. &lt;i&gt;Quite &lt;/i&gt;a lot.
Without you, we&apos;d be dead on that beach. My thanks, ben-Mezd.
Look out, Quercus! More of the Great Acorn&apos;s monsters!
*Notice the look of concern on her face. Ask if she&apos;s alright.*
Eager child, before we discuss the where, we must first muse the &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;. The Well of Ascension is a lake: a pool of pure Source in which the powers of the Seven lie united.
You, Sebille, the elven Divine. What did you do with your power? What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
Are you sure you want to disconnect from the game?
*Try to bargain again. Tell her you hunt flesh for her still.*
If ya win here, ya get to fight in other ones once they let us outta Fort Joy. Maybe even gain the power of the One.
Above all else, remember &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;
Sing, causing enemies in the target area to become Mad. Maddened characters will attack those nearest them, regardless of alignment.
Go on: sun&apos;s out! You really want to be in here?
Feisty! Well, don&apos;t mind me. I&apos;m in no mood to meet &apos;im again, is all. Used to be his apprentice, but I&apos;m much happier puttin&apos; my feet up in the hole than chasing demons hither and thither.
*Point out that all the fish are Void-tainted.*

*Say that you actually feel strangely empty and lost. You don&apos;t feel the elation you had thought would follow this death.*
*Hesitantly greet the spirit.*

Tomb
Notes on the Armour of the Devourer: Crafted in the Ancient Empire between 400 and 500 A.R., but not by the Empire, no. To bring a new ruler to their proper ascension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was forged by a lizard who named herself the Outlaw Empress, exiled from the nobility for the warped turn of her jaw. What petty madness, but I will benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are five pieces in total: gauntlets, sabatons, legguards, helmet, and a chestplate.  I have recovered the gauntlets, but a strange sensation washes over me when I hold them. A voice calls to me in the dark, burning like…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter. I uncovered some etchings of the Outlaw Empress&apos; cult. She served as the “voice of the Dragon”. Her cultists used a flaming arrowhead symbol to mark their secret gathering places. I wonder what else they may be hiding. Either way, it seems I would require a fire rune to open the “true path”.
Godwoken. I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s too late for me to help you - my strength is depleted. I wish you good fortune in your trials.
*Noting the attention, he straightens, revealing insignia spelling &lt;i&gt;KINNET...&lt;/i&gt; and a jagged wound spilling his innards upon the ground. He reaches a ghostly hand into your chest and &lt;i&gt;squeezes &lt;/i&gt;your heart.*
And I bring her your heartless heart!
The tigers fly, the leopards lie, and you... and you... Oh! But I know you, don&apos;t I? I have seen you in the night. Older than life; younger than death... Just a dream, of course. Just a dream.
Find somewhere that peddles intelligence herb mixes, then add the monkfish that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; gave you - the effects of the new mixture could be quite interesting...
