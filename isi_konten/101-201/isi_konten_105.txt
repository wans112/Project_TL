*She cocks her head and looks at you for a long moment. Her eyes are dull and dark, more sunken than they used to be.*
That&apos;s not for me to say. If you must kill me, then... kill me.
*Cough nervously and say her tone earlier suggested a more light-hearted story.*
An empty pedestal, in the design of my people. Whatever lay here, it was important.
Whatever the Magisters were doing down here... they &lt;i&gt;woke&lt;/i&gt; something - and it killed them all.
Between you &apos;n&apos; me, you should head down to Effie&apos;s Emporium. If you can keep yer lips sealed, Lohar&apos;ll have some work for ya.
*Taryan Graye, who died at the hand of Lucian, weeps for Raedalus, her lost love.*
*It flinches. A low, threatening growl builds within its throat.*
I&apos;m tellin&apos; you &lt;i&gt;nothin&apos;.&lt;/i&gt; My brother Delorus&apos;ll hear about this, and then there&apos;ll be trouble. Delorus looks after his own.

Mysterious Pillar
Nice weather, innit? I suppose we cling to the small pleasures in life, such as they are.
Archivist&apos;s Journal
In his mercy and wisdom, the King is willing to overlook your past sins against him. The King offers another chance.
Hahaha! Oh dear! I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re a long way from home, milady; a long way from the little bells that make a footman come a-running!
A Dreamer cannot die in the Dream. I cannot stop you. &lt;i&gt;But the Red Princess will.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask how you can help.*
I&apos;ll not forget this. I wonder if I could get a letter out of this place. Ah, my daughter would love to hear I&apos;d seen the great Bishop up close...
To be honest, I&apos;d reached the end of my tether with what &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;could do here...
Target a corpse to raise a bloated cadaver that fights for you. It can explode, dealing Physical Damage.
You see, there&apos;s...
Time for you and your belly full of litter to crawl back to the king, darling! Gonna get me some private time with prince charming myself!
Igniting Poison
Haven&apos;t seen you around here before. New?
Pain_Lg_1
[VILLAIN] *Stifle a laugh, then allow her memories to continue...*
*Deep within, you can feel your God stirring - hissing like a snake.*
*Shake your head. Now&apos;s not the time.*
*You think of what you could do with such power. The rights you&apos;d wrong. The wars you&apos;d win.*
*Bow humbly and ask what&apos;s happening here.*
Find the little girl.
But never mind that. If you need to suit up, I can offer you a fair price. If not, I would thank you to move on.
Can&apos;t say I&apos;m not sorry to see you go, but you&apos;ll be alright. There&apos;s plenty of kindred spirits in Reaper&apos;s Coast.
Hurts? My dear boy, no. All I feel is pride. My Featherfall knows just how to slice and just what to chew.
*Say you agree; she should find out what what she can from him.*
*Roll your eyes. Enough already!*
We found a list of Stonegarden visitors in Ryker&apos;s Rest. Apparently a traveler stole a set of dragon-bone boots, and the Servant sent to kill him ended up in an incinerator.
*Cough quietly to get his attention.*
*Tell the cub not to trust you. &lt;i&gt;Particularly &lt;/i&gt;not you.*
*The Paladin is still trying to stem the flow of blood.*
Targh
State your name! NOW!
Those words were your last, dwarf.
*A robed woman crawls away desperately, her face a mask of terror...*
[FANE] *You would think someone returning to the world would show a little more enthusiasm...*
Rrrraf!
And what of you?
*Your job here is done. Turn and leave.*
*Ask how you can help him.*
Perhaps it would be wise to follow it? People can do terrible things when freed. Even accidentally...
It doesn&apos;t feel quite right, but... I need all the equipment I can find.
*Tell them the bad news - there&apos;s only enough for one.*
*Ask Fane what happened to him.*
*Glance at the dead lying nearby. They look like they were caught unawares...*
Accept
Traitors will not be tolerated in Driftwood. We even dragged the Sourcerers&apos; Meistr out of town to be hung, so her blood would not stain these cobbles.
*Edden turns back to her drink. Tatcher smiles goodbye.*
*Search her for the dreamers&apos; location.*
*Tell her you know about her little contract. Is that what she&apos;s attending to here?*
Are you sure you want to return to the main menu?
That knight I saw in the Sallow Man&apos;s mirror... was that Kemm?!
Your everything... We see much the same then, in our own ways.
*Your hand drops away from the soul jar, your skin prickling. In the back of your mind you hear a small, scared voice whimper before fading to nothing.*
A worthy dream, lass. I&apos;m sure you can claim a patch for yourself after all this is over.
*A dry, rattling laugh rises from the figure&apos;s ancient gullet.*
A rival&apos;s revenge? Another merchant&apos;s madness? O, the fever of gold is reason&apos;s bane...
Become the new Mother Tree, Scion. Serve the elves. Lead your people into the light.
Curse of Scion
*The cub&apos;s maw quivers.*
*The skeleton pauses and sighs, then straightens his spine with a clatter.*
Now please. Don&apos;t let me keep you.
We defeated Mordus. He begged us to spare him.
Dwarven Customs &amp; Traditions
Adept Wizard
Suffice to say I need to speak with Zaleskar. So let&apos;s find him.
Undead... &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Godwoken? Well, now I&apos;ve seen everything.
Take otters, for example. Energetic, waterproof cats: utterly beautiful creatures!
Lo, hedgerow! Bow before Septa the Ineffable - bow before it&apos;s too late!
*Say you&apos;ve no remembrance of any such occurrence.*
Silent Watcher
So? C&apos;mon, don&apos;t keep me in suspense: What&apos;re you gonna do with your almighty power?
May Lucian return.
Hah! Say that to Griff&apos;s face and see if that knife &apos;a his don&apos;t give you somethin&apos; to answer to. Criminy, Flora, when&apos;d you get so big in your boots?
An egg... a &lt;i&gt;phoenix egg!&lt;/i&gt;
Grenade Frost
You can mosey round camp, but watch it: the docks are restricted. Even &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; not allowed down there.
I fear for the Seekers, now that he walks with the spirits. Without the wands he sought, not one will escape this island.
Evil? Yes - I suppose he is. I imagine you think the same of me. Go on, call me what you like. After all, neither of us have shied from playing the villain, have we? I&apos;m not nice. I&apos;m just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrug. Who hasn&apos;t done terrible things?*
*You reach out your gnarled hand. The victimized spirit writhes in agony as you siphon its Source into your failing body.*
*Ask him why Saheila is so important to him.*
*Ignore the warning and ready your weapon.*
I... I... Mother, I have no words for that.
Immortality is only permanent, my dear boy, until one day it simply ceases to be.
What a well of knowledge this tome is! Dallis is such a dear lending it to me.
The Little Book of Big Booms
*As Sadha and the Red Prince walk down the wagon&apos;s steps, you suddenly witness a group of lizards appearing as if out of nowhere.*
Of silver, gold, and diamonds, now dispose...
Exploration Theme 04 Light A
Ah! How good of you to come. And you&apos;ve brought my favourite person in the entire world. How are you, Lohse dear.
What&apos;s the world coming to? First the egg is HERE, then it&apos;s GONE!
This is our penance and this is his punishment. Do not release him. Do not release the monster!
*The man chomps on the bit of his pipe, generating a small cloud of nervous smoke... finally, he plucks it from his mouth and clears his throat.*
By Lucian&apos;s sword, we meet again! Would that circumstances were better here than in Fort Joy. But they are not; Voidwoken lie in wait beyond the bridge.
*Chuckle wickedly and draw your weapon.*
*Reach for your weapon and invite him to try.*
I was casting a line and I cast me bloody wedding ring instead. Guess me fingers aren&apos;t as fat as they used to be.
*The face in the door is confused for a moment.*
I-I-I&apos;m no soldier, no sir, not no more. I took off my uniform years ago, but I... I &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; have nightmares of what we did to the elves. Maybe, maybe if I walk the Path, maybe Lucian will grant me peace...
Target must be within range: [2]
Um, um, &apos;scuse me, um, Mister Scary Guy... have you seen our ball?
Eyes up, child! Look me in the face!
Human arrogance, carved in stone.
*Declare that she shouldn&apos;t have kept souvenirs - you found the ring took from one of the Magisters that she murdered.*
Boots
*You might be interested in a friendly wager...*
Engrave Item
*Try to address the girl. Tell her that there&apos;s people who&apos;re searching for her, who will help her.*
Rather large for a cellar, isn&apos;t it...
The Eternals cannot be &apos;eternal&apos; without the Source your gods stole from them.
Off to Paradise Downs. I need to make sure my parents are safe.
*Break it to him gently; his friends won&apos;t be coming. They were murdered.*
I told the red lizard royals that engendering dragons was a bad idea. They attacked me.
The Magisters are trying to keep everyone out of Lucian&apos;s tomb. I don&apos;t yet know why.
The &lt;i&gt;gods&lt;/i&gt; didn&apos;t make you into a mercenary. The gods didn&apos;t make you agree to kill that elf in Fort Joy. Oh yes, I know about that. And who&apos;s to blame?
A raised bridge stands outside Driftwood. The bridgekeeper&apos;s son says Voidwoken have trapped his mother on the other side.
For real? Finally! Here&apos;s the key. Now, come on Jhad...
*Tell her the truth. Gareth is dead.*
*Exhausted, knowing he can smash your head to a pulp on the barren ground, you give in and do as he says.*
[A record kept over months, perhaps years, written by many hands and stained with blood and gore of various hues from russet red to black, the book records &lt;i&gt;experiments,&lt;/i&gt; grievous intrusions inflicted on living Sourcerers, and suspected Sourcerers. All involve a search for Source within the victim&apos;s body. All result in the victim&apos;s painful drawn-out death. None succeed. The Source will not be found.]
*Turn to other matters.*
You help enough. My armour guides me now - and it is eager to be gone.
Gold Ring
Get. These. &lt;i&gt;Off.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask if she wants you to get her out of here.*
She&apos;s something, alright.
Why can&apos;t you just... &lt;i&gt;stop?&lt;/i&gt;
Statue of Astarte
*The verbal barrage continues, but something changes within Fane. He looks up and golden light pours from his skull. When he speaks next you understand every word, but you&apos;re not sure the words are his own.*
*Ifan strides to stand by the Doctor then turns to face you, eyes cool as a winter&apos;s lake.*
The man is dead.
They lie dead while I still breathe. That seems like an acceptable situation.
*Say that she mentioned she&apos;s a musician. Ask if she knows any good songs.*
It spreads even now, just below. I am ready to prove my loyalty.
Useless... bloody &lt;i&gt;useless!&lt;/i&gt;
*Remain still.*
You think Arx is safe in my death? I&apos;ve faced the grave before, you know, as have you. Yet through the God King, I have eternal life.
Make it quick. I don&apos;t got all day.
No frills, no frippery, all business. Much like Dallis herself. But how did they get here of all places?
She opened it and looked at the marks on the inside, how the hell else?
Everhart? The name means nothing, and anyway I had nothing to do with it. And nor did this axe - I took it from an elven raider a day or two ago.
The burden falls on you, my love. Only you can save us.
My doors only open on the occasion of truth. What you admit to them, you admit to me, dwarf.
