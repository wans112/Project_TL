*Leave Gareth&apos;s spirit in perpetual contemplation.*
No staff weapon equipped&lt;br&gt;
*Say that&apos;s something for you to worry about when the time comes. Right now, you expect him answer your question... or else.*
Break into the Magisters&apos; barracks, find their records, and seek out Masters of the Source. Without their help you will never have the strength to travel within your own soul.
*Say you&apos;ve heard of the mad Source king... and seen some of his handiwork around this place...*
[OUTLAW] *Tell her you want to be a good citizen and obey all relevant laws. Obviously.*
We need to impress in the arena to earn a shot at the championship.
Darkness will come now. We do not stop it. We cannot stop it.
Return to main menu
*The surface of the mirror ripples with a sickly haze. As you gaze into its surface, the haze forms shapes and the shapes jerk into a figure.*
*Bless the spirit to ease its passage into the next world.*
The scroll is ours. Our search continues.
*The doors loom above you. One step closer to the Council. One step closer to Divinity.*
Gods Sent Armour
*Say that the temple is done for. He&apos;d be better off redeploying his troops elsewhere, so they can be of more use.*
Warm Coast
I trust that you&apos;ll keep him in check, now more than any other time. If you don&apos;t, the result will be... cataclysmic.
[JESTER] *Tell him your name is Viktar. That&apos;s right, V-I-K-T-A-R, &lt;i&gt;Viktar.*&lt;/i&gt;
OUT OF MY WAY! &lt;i&gt;Quickly!&lt;/i&gt;
*Hand over the tablet and Swornbreaker parts to Almira.*
You... you are &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
That thing belongs in a cage!
Extravagant Amulet
It is done! The Master&apos;s dead! Finally I am free!
*Nod. He said something about deepening your alliance? How does he want to achieve this?*
Turn and leave, stranger. No entry here.
Find out what&apos;s going on in the caves, and there&apos;ll be something in it for you.
So here we are. The end of it all.
*Nod. You haven&apos;t forgotten.*
&apos;I shall not mourn &apos;til war is done...&apos;
Why, thank you.
I am Gratiana, humble priestess of Amadia and keeper of this shrine.
But you will *cough* know when he comes. You will feel his grace.
To sleep - perchance to dream, dear prince.
Permit me to mark it on your map. Do not tarry, he urgently desires to speak with you.
*Back away.*
You! I know what you&apos;ve been up to, thief. And you&apos;re not getting away with it!
There&apos;s no graveyard on the island. Stay away from the graveyard.
It&apos;s all well and good for you, with your rations. We&apos;ve gotta take what we can get.
*She takes a deep breath, then raises her head and meets your gaze. Her stare is resolute, aged far beyond her years.*
*The Red Prince cocks his head, then peers into the portal more closely. You follow suit, and notice a spot of red beyond the sandy swirls that you missed before.*
Waiting is what I do best whenever &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;around.
*Tell him you&apos;ve already explored the tomb in question, and show him the object you found there.*
*Ask about the One.*
*She waves a bandaged hand absent-mindedly, wincing slightly.*
*Leya nods her assent with a radiant smile.*
[HUMAN] *Say his story is well-known, even outside the dwarven kingdom. He was outcast after trying to overthrow Queen Justinia - right?*
Please! Help me... *cough*. She... has not much time. I... have not much time!
Please... please...! You must help me. &lt;i&gt;No-one &lt;/i&gt;here will help me... not one of these bastards! A child is &lt;i&gt;missing!&lt;/i&gt; My baby!
Corpse
This town doesn&apos;t look much equipped to entertain a nobleman like myself. Pity.
*Ask him how he can bear to see his own kind imprisoned, experimented upon, transformed into hideous weapons.*
Get the hell away from me, freak. I don&apos;t need your Void taint!
*Say you understand combat well enough.*
One of Lohar&apos;s, are you? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; should know better than to poke your nose into the Queen&apos;s secret operations.
We discovered that once the network will be large enough, dryads will sprout from these roots, equipped with the memories, experience and enormous powers of generations of elves: a vast invincible army that will obliterate everything in their path. It will be the end of all other races.
I let him out of the vault. I killed anyone that got in the way. And then I sat here as he gibbered about needing to complete his bloody Mord&apos;Akaim.
*Fraud.*
You need to go see the Meistr.
*Lie. You have seen the error of your rebellious ways, and seek to return to the court.*
Say... let me show you something...
Frost Grenade
*The spirit of a young robed man paces the chamber anxiously. He sees you approach - a look of trepidation crosses his spectral features.*
Don&apos;t look so pleased with yourself. You&apos;re too quick to act, too green still. Mastery was there for the taking, yet you refused it.
*Reveal your dreams of gilded robes and opulent castles of granite and marble.*
Greasy Door
Executioner
Find the caverns beneath the Blackpits.
*Tell him that you intend to do the talking.*
It really rather was, though I must admit that even to sit on that throne amid that eerie crowd, destined to become leaf and bark, was not so dreadful a prospect as what came next.
You can find the girl in Fort Joy. Move quickly; I&apos;ve heard certain Sourcerers are being transformed into Sourceless slaves - no doubt a Scion would make a tempting candidate.&lt;br&gt;Kill her cleanly, but not before extracting every morsel of useful information from her. The more Scions you destroy, the heavier you&apos;ll find your pockets. You can collect your payment from me on the Nameless Isle. Get one of your other little marks to show you the way.&lt;br&gt;Shadow Prince&lt;br&gt;
Military notes on correct care and maintenance of equipment. Following the advice in these notes might just keep you alive out there.
*Consume her Source. There will be no release, only Void.*
Supercharged
*Try &apos;12345678&apos;.*
Maybe I should leave like the others did. The next attack could be the death of me. I&apos;ll serve no-one dead.
A winged, bearded sage. How... quaintly human.
The Beast&apos;s Theme Tavern
Rabbit&apos;s Paw
*Ask why she opted not to do what Malady asked. She could have severely weakened the demon.*
*Deep within your soul, you feel your God stirring at the sound of the voice. You can feel its anger and fear swelling inside you.*
*She opens and closes her jaw several times before deciding to speak. She dusts off her tunic as she confides in you, leaving a musty scent lingering in the air, like an old attic piled high with mildewed paper.*
Craft a set of the Vulture&apos;s Armour.
The failure is mine.
Not now! I&apos;ve got a kitchen and a bar to run. Bloody Wyvlia! Someone should&apos;ve taught her a little decorum!
Ifan, eh? On t-the run from Fort Joy, are you?
*Grin and offer to make it stop.*
*Say Mordus told you they&apos;re already on their way to Arx.*
*The spirit sways on her feet, then collapses.*
Help me, please my lord. My lord, my lord *snarl* help me...
Grog the troll is dead.
*Ask him how the dog died.*
To feel well; to feel wholesome; to have been witness to a wonder!
...uuuuuice?
*Refuse the offer.*
Air Resistance
Well hello again.
How &lt;i&gt;marvellous!&lt;/i&gt;
*You can&apos;t hide the concern on your face. She doesn&apos;t seem well...*
&lt;i&gt;Get out of here already!&lt;/i&gt;
*Ifan bites his lip and laughs.*
The Thieves&apos; Guild is down here somewhere.
Rhymes Of The Ranger, Part 5
I have yet to learn a mortal phrase that politely encapsulates both &apos;goodbye&apos; and &apos;I hope you fall down a well&apos;, so...
Someone will yet be chosen.
Some Sourcerer who fled by earlier. And &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; paid a handsome toll too! Glory, what a marvellous day!
*The child whimpers, poking at your latent maternal instinct.*
Like so. A short, sharp shock. Your very last one.
Some years ago, a superstition regarding lucky rabbits&apos; feet led to a decimation of the local population by hopeful hunters. The trend was abandoned, but the rumours about the feet were never definitively disproven, either.
There&apos;s no time! Run, you idiot. Run!
Wait - why am I not a Silent Monk right now? So much for a noble sacrifice...
Fire Beetle
*The Voidwoken hisses as Fane approaches. It calls him traitor, but it calls him brother too.*
As true for the big things in life as it is for the little.
[SEBILLE] *Say you know a choice contract when you see it; how much?*
Disgusting.
No info
Automated Hotbar Behaviour
Raider Boss
Fulltongue
From forests fair to cities bleak...
My word, the Red Prince! It really is you! I have a message for you, my lord, from Sadha herself.
*Shrug. You won&apos;t stop the man from doing what he has to do.*
The Source Barrier
*He squeezes your hand, hard.*
You were sealed away because of what you did, not in spite of it, traitor!
That demon&apos;s already gettin&apos; in your head? Very well then, your eminent holiness.
Prey does not talk, it runs.
To be vulnerable in a place like this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; tough. You may keep your shame for yourself. An open heart knows the difference between right and wrong.
Don&apos;t be a stranger now.
Party level
It proved to be child&apos;s play to outwit her. No doubt it&apos;ll be child&apos;s play to cut her down.
*Tell her not to be too greedy. Quite frankly you&apos;ve need of all the Source you can get.*
not a summon
Well done, Lohse. You made the right choice. The sacrifice is a worthy one. Her death may save many others.
Well, bugger.
I - we - will never know the comfort of the Hall of Echoes. This is our penance and the Seekers&apos; burden.
[1] created [2] [3]
You were very powerful already; a Master of the Source, but I did not let this burst of power go to waste. It lies condensed on parchment, for you to read and learn.
*Ponder his offer. If it&apos;s about the queen, you already know about her plan; Lohar sent you.*
Wood Chips
*Very well. Reach out and lightly place a finger on the needle&apos;s tip.*
Unconscious
Leather Boots
Pocket Knife
The Paladins guarding Gareth&apos;s childhood home allowed us past.
The gods don&apos;t know everything, chief. Look around. The Voidwoken, the Divine Order... seems to me we&apos;re on our own here.
*The spirit&apos;s eyes move in your direction, trying to focus, but he seems to look right through you.*
Sweet Whisperer
*He releases your arms, but keeps you pinned within his stare. No matter the adventures you have shared together, something has changed irrevocably in this moment. There is no trace of camaraderie remaining in the way he looks at you.*
Hey! I feel... okay! Thanks! Think I&apos;ll wander off now. &apos;ere, &apos;fore I go, what can I do to show my gratitude?
*She casts a sidelong glance at the drunken elf leaning over the bar.*
Erratic Entity
Edit Appearance
*She gives you a long look. Then...*
Welcome be, Red Prince, to the haven in the horror. I only wish you hadn&apos;t faltered near the end; hadn&apos;t lost her.
Damn fools. The faster we leave them behind, the happier I shall be.
Here lies Withermoore the yellow-bellied
[JESTER] *Say that you&apos;ve always taken Jimmy&apos;s side and you&apos;re not about to stop now.*
*Ask if she&apos;s ever thought about escaping.*
Throw Explosive Trap
*A sound reaches you from the wagon. Some kind of... moan.*
[LIZARD] *Scoff at the notion - your people&apos;s records go back millennia! You have records of every king  to walk Rivellon - this &apos;Seven lords&apos; talk is nonsense.*
Look away from the past and into the future, Prince. There is so much work left to do.
