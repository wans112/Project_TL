I&apos;m alright as long as I don&apos;t think about it too much.
*He narrows his eyes.*
*The elf tilts his head backwards, but his squinted eyes don&apos;t stray from you.*
*Tell him he is relieved.*
This place is dangerous, Mistress. I can feel the ground quake and the seas boil. But I am here to serve, as you wish.
All-powerful beings reigning supreme over us little folk... I should have known better than to think they were truly benevolent. We should let the Void take the lot of them.
I am a single droplet in the storm come to engulf you...
*Squeak!*
Tarquin found the new world... unchallenging.
I&apos;m the one asking the questions... wait. Toys? Explosive toys? Explosive toys in a sabotaged cake?
[1] gives you +[2] to Bartering.
Enough. My armour wants finding. And you - &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;must pray we do not meet again.
*Remind Beast that when the sea came to take him - when Windego attacked - you guided him to safety. He must let you ascend, so you can do the same once more, for him, for the rebels, and for all the dwarven people.*
How curious mortals are. Laughing when they should be screaming. Oh how I have missed your kind.
*Ifan stalks forward and grips the Sourcerer by the throat, lifting her clean off the ground. She sputters and chokes, eyes bulging and hands flailing as he squeezes her neck tighter and tighter. As she gasps for breath, he &lt;i&gt;shakes&lt;/i&gt; her.*
*Tell him your name.*
In Arx, we&apos;ll find Micheil Ros at his daughter&apos;s wedding. He may be able to help us stop the Queen&apos;s Deathfog plot.
*You take a nearby quill and dip it into an inkwell. Then you poise its tip over the framed square of parchment...*
*The spirit of the owl hops heavily from claw to claw, squinting up at you over his bulging fluffy cheeks.*
[JESTER] *Sigh. And you thought the biggest problem with the helm was it didn&apos;t come in your colour.*
If you fight, I will watch with great interest.
You! Help my mistress, &lt;i&gt;please! &lt;/i&gt;These blue-cloaked beasts are keeping her locked in a cage underground! Please hurry - she&apos;ll be grateful!
*Skins sloughs from the nose onto your finger.*
*Say that you agree. Divinity should be more than tyranny.*
Nestor
Move along, buck. This don&apos;t concern you.
I couldn&apos;t care a jot if it was Magisters or Paladins ruling Arx, so long as they keep their bloody tax collectors away from my door.
*The sobbing bear cub looks at you, eyes filled with sadness. Then it turns away. There&apos;s nothing you can do.*
You have my apologies, fellow elf.
*Sigh and remark that you&apos;ve already had the &apos;pleasure&apos; of meeting his princess, but now you must be on your way...*
Rich Necklace
Mouldering Terramancer
Steam error
Until next time.
*Examine the egg more closely.*
*The bear gulps. It looks doubtful.*
Next Level [1]: +[2]% more damage.
He hardly has his father&apos;s qualities. Besides, he&apos;s not to be trusted.
He will not... allow the King to rule unchallenged...
Am I to shed a tear for a Sourcerer? As if any of those beasts are &apos;innocent.&apos;
Demonic Madness Shout
Magister Varland
*Tell him to wait there. Quietly.*
The Shadow Prince asked us to deliver a Deathfog bomb to the Heart of the Mother Tree.
Snuggle-friend, thonk ye! *HNR!* On the double!
It&apos;s... it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;ruined!&lt;/i&gt; That &lt;i&gt;BRUTE!&lt;/i&gt;
*He looks at you slyly. Alexandar was always easy to read, and right now his face is an open book. He&apos;s clearly remembering conversations in which your fate was chosen.*
[1] doesn&apos;t need to be repaired.
You would attack the Magisters directly? Are you so eager to die, Seeker?
Headstrong
Magic and mayhem surround us! The island is crumbling!
Candle
A demon ascended to Divinity. I may have made a terrible mistake...
Sentinel
With a new Divine at the helm, Malady had a powerful ally... until the war with the demons began. Then, Malady the half-demon fell under suspicion... from both sides.
The Seneschal
Store on Lady Vengeance
Create Frozen Water Surface
Run along, darling. Entertain my guests.
*Say there&apos;s no job you can&apos;t handle.*
The Source amulet and scroll can be found at a local toy shop. The toymaker&apos;s name is Sanders.
What... what have you done? Monsters...!
The demon within the possessed dwarf was banished.
Damage: [1] - [2]
Greetings! It&apos;s a brave elf who travels this road. It&apos;s a braver one who crosses the bridge and travels east. You have my admiration; it&apos;s a hellscape out there.
Studied under a real maestro, though; learned this &apos;n&apos; that, too.
Bloodlust
*Say that you want to know what happened here first. How did they all die?*
Ngh, no - thank you, but no. I&apos;m fully fit to burst with all I&apos;ve eaten, and it was all terribly uneventful.
The Shriekers are watching us still...
Dirty Note
How... how is this possible? Shouldn&apos;t we be Silent Monks now?
*Hold out the egg you saved and show it to her.*
And then suddenly I&apos;m here, apparently facin&apos; an inquisition.
Mod dependencies error
Are you done?
*The Meistr is examining her wounds. Prodding at this, wincing at that. Her face seems grim as she turns to you.*
Didn&apos;t I tell you to get lost?
*Tell her not to worry, you&apos;re sure the Meistr is fine.*
Summon Cat Familiar
Just doing my job. Please, I...
Of course I did! Takes more than some over-sized cuttlefish to get the better of me! Besides, you&apos;ll find I wasn&apos;t complaining, I was making a point. About oneself. &lt;i&gt;Alone.&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, I&apos;m a wizard. And I was a long time ago, too. In between, I was a pig. And I was on fire for most of that time.
*She looks down, an uncharacteristic cast of melancholy passing over her face.*
I appreciate the sentiment, but please do not spout your spittle so close to my person. Save it for the lady herself - if you must.
*Say you didn&apos;t save it alone.*
[This complicated set of schematics details the functions of the Aeteran. One drawing shows seven celestial beings bowing to the device.]
And I would destroy both, had I the power to will it so.
Well look at that, why don&apos;t you? You&apos;ve got a deal. Now be gone, before someone catches wind of this.
Of course, my child. All you did was to seek knowledge - the true crime was your punishment. And you will have justice, but first you must return to the world and escape that island.
*Insist that there&apos;s no time to spare. Enter the boat and lower it into the chilly sea.*
*Ask who made the mess in the room.*
Freezing Touch
*Ask where you can find Mordus.*
*The patient cat finally pounces. She strikes, precisely; exactly. Her needle pierces his neck: spears his vocal cords, filling his throat with blood.*
You! How dare you interfere?!
You have... conviction. Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more. There is violence. There is lust. There is foolishness. The sentence is more. The sentence is pain eternal. What is the sin?
Some crimes, like murdering or stealing, leave a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;crime scene&lt;/font&gt;. Even if nobody saw you commit the crime, they might become suspicious and start investigating.
*His face cracks into a scarred grimace.*
*Tell the girl that she&apos;s strong enough to vanquish this demon - it&apos;s nothing but a parasite.*
Bishop&apos;s the son of the dead Divine. Dunno when we&apos;ll get a new one, but Alexandar&apos;s lookin&apos; after us in the meantime all the same.
Now is not the time for that.
*Take your leave.*
Voidwoken! Trouble&apos;s always on the horizon...
*The tablet seems to glow from within with a subtle light. Etched runes cover its surface. The markings &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; familiar, but despite the depth of your study and learning... you have no idea what they mean.*
You play games with me. Very well. I never lose.
[BARBARIAN] *Demand the respect a warrior like you has earned.*
I don&apos;t know, Aloysius. Jimmy&apos;s always been the smart one. Jimmy? Jimmy, what&apos;s a mantelpiece? &lt;i&gt;Jimmy?!&lt;/i&gt;
There are many others. They are less like me - they bear less life. They are content to kill any who enter the bad place.
My thanks once again, for putting an end to those &lt;i&gt;things &lt;/i&gt;inside the consulate. They might have been lizards once... but no longer.
*At first glance, the spirit seems much like its host. Hollow. Detached. Yet in its eyes, you see something more ominous, something not apparent before: agony.*
Thievery [1]
*The Magister slides his finger along the shivering woman&apos;s cheek, and motions to the executioner to stand down.*
Stag
Only a fool does not fear the Void! &lt;i&gt;Now fight!&lt;/i&gt;
Bark At The Rune: Pixie Dust
But you know most of this already. I just get all jumpy around you sometimes, like if I don&apos;t keep my lips busy with talkin&apos;, they&apos;ll get busy with kissin&apos;.
*Ask how his principles mesh with extorting money for the use of a public bridge.*
*The woman&apos;s breathing has grown shallow as she hovers between life and death. All you can do is close her up and hope for the best.*
Five-Star Diner
*Her lips part and her mouth moves. Did she whisper &lt;i&gt;&apos;Save me&apos;?*&lt;/i&gt;
*Her brow furrows as she looks around the Shelter. When she looks back at you, her eyes are glassy and devoid of hope.*
[IFAN] *Say you&apos;ve never played a lute, but you&apos;ve certainly made people &lt;i&gt;sing&lt;/i&gt;...*
I don&apos;t like it down here... don&apos;t like it at all...
*Ask what she did wrong in her past.*
*The vision fades, leaving only the blazing fire, a glowing sun emblem on the altar, and the echoing laughter of a malicious god.*
I... was not chosen for divinity. Instead I stayed here, and guarded this temple.
Do you have news of Thom?
[1] new journal updates available.
*Before you lies the hulking, broken ruins of Eternal technology. It&apos;s familiar, but after so long feels strangely alien too.*
*Scoff. Murder is murder, no matter which banner mops up the blood.*
*Roost looks around shiftily and pats his pockets, but ignores your question.*
*Your hand straightens before your very eyes. The wrinkles smooth and the age spots fade. The pulsing blue veins that once crisscrossed are now unseen, hidden under newly taut skin.*
*Look past the guard and to the door. Does his presence mean Justinia&apos;s inside?*
You freed a master of the magical arts. For that, I&apos;ll leave you alive and untasted. For demolishing Mordus&apos; minions, I&apos;ll give you a skillbook of your choice. Choose your subject.
Praise be! You have my thanks, friend.
*Look at his hand, visibily withering before you. Is there anything you can do?*
*Tell him to hurry up, you don&apos;t have all day.*
So: How&apos;d you make it out of Fort Joy?
Dwarf Bandit Ranger
Get lost, pig.
Open the inventory panel, select the scroll and press [IE_Interact].
*Squeak.*
Dummy
Lucian returned as Divine,
*The spirit&apos;s lips curl into a sneer.*
*Ask what happened.*
Whatever that Magister told you, I hope it helps...
Let&apos;s move out, sailor!
Fane, Fane... Fane the brave. Fane the saviour...
Rivellon has suffered enough. Let&apos;s share the power. With &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;. And then? Let&apos;s all fight the Void... together.
Maybe one of these books? They must have written something down.
You, you, you... you shouldn&apos;t have done that! No, no, no!
*Ask what she did to gain the Magisters attention in the first place.*
Xantezza
I am your death... I take your all... I am your last breath... I SHALL TAKE YOUR SOUL...
*Sallow gives you a long look. The tendrils of his mind snap about yours, but they do not probe. With difficulty, he summons the power of his speech.*
*Tell Gareth you&apos;ll return later.*
Enough to sever my link to the font from which all Source flows. And certainly enough that I cannot train you.
