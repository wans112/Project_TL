*He looks around the hazy room with hasted eyes.*
Protector Deserter
A reproduction of the original First Passion. Wonder how faithful it is.
You protect me. You save me. You are my light.
Scratch the Master&apos;s name from your arm.
There still might be a day for promises between us. It&apos;s just not today.
First time, I was dragged in as a Sourcerer, same as everyone else. After I escaped, I came back in to find someone. Magisters nabbed me before I could sneak back out.
Looks like the corruption in the Divine Order goes even higher than we thought...
*Tell her you need a moment.*
*Say that if he&apos;s a merchant, you wouldn&apos;t mind having a look at his wares.*
Pillar
Perhaps lizard blood does not truly run cold then, thank you...
You &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; be serious. Do you know what I... &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; can accomplish with this sword made whole?
Brightness
I know, I know. Okay. I&apos;m on it.
It seems like someone&apos;s been telling tales about me... foolish. Very foolish...
You&apos;re under arrest! Violent types like you belong in a cell.
I shall not mourn &apos;til war is done... I shall not weep while blood still runs...
A living is nothing if you&apos;re unhappy.
*Lohar clutches his chest and opens his eyes wide, preparing for the finishing blow. Beast moves to attack, then thinks the better of it and takes a step back.*
Not eager to bow before the great Bishop Alexandar, son of the Divine himself? My sentiments exactly... but Vik here&apos;ll blow a blood vessel if he hears you talking like that.
*Ask about the wand he seeks.*
Same little beauty the Order used to wipe out Black Ring with a side order of elves in the last war.
*She tilts her head back and blinks back tears.*
*He laughs good-naturedly.*
One can&apos;t but feel somewhat taken aback by being treated as no more than a pawn, especially when one&apos;s the king on the board.
*With a new bounce in its tail, the rat wanders away.*
Gloves of Teleportation
No, I understand not! I demand you be the heart!
The blacksmith Nebora can remove Source collars.
*A demon. Say you had  your suspicions, but it&apos;s still terrible to have them confirmed.*
*Express your shock. How could he know you are Godwoken?*
*His eyes scan the horizon, and then settle on yours. A moment passes.*
Yarak
Storage conflict
Everything costs something &apos;round here. Only question is how much you&apos;re willing to pay.
Magical Helm
[UNDEAD] *Wonder what it must be like - to die and to be dead.*
If this little egg can make it... well maybe we can too. I&apos;m going to keep it safe.
Shabby Letter
A local dwarven Sourcerer may be connected to the criminal underworld. Perhaps this Mordus could make a potential teacher.
[JESTER] *Explain that it&apos;s hard to remember a name like Belworm.*
Scale Boots
Thanks, but I already belong to an elite and exclusive ship gang. We play ball every day after lunch. You&apos;re too soft for it.
Wearing this bucket as a helmet would only give you a dirty face. But its rich soil could make a happy home for a plant.
|explosions.|
*Say you were born under the full moon.*
Master Room
See you in Driftwood? I&apos;ll show you where my stash is then, if you still want stuff.
*Han stares fixedly at the dirt floor, twitching lips giving away the grimace he&apos;s trying to hide as Samadel applies stinking ointment to a deep gash on his leg.*
What a perceptive one you are.
The wand works! We destroyed a Shrieker!
The trial of combat has ended - you are victorious. Your prize awaits. Use it wisely, as a true elf.
The mere recollection of this tune... It haunts me. Sometimes, in dreams, I hear it whistled and I fear it&apos;s real. I fear I&apos;ll never wake up again because it holds me enthralled in the night.
*Scratch your chin. That can&apos;t have gone well.*
The Red Prince discharged his duty to the Empire. To Lucian&apos;s tomb we must go.
Royal Dwarven Shield
Level [1]: heal for [2]% of damage dealt.
I trust myself and the weapon in my hand. Everything else is up to fate.
General
Ssst! Listen!
*Bark! Bork! Rawf!*
Return to the Elven Scion.
I would have watched you - like I have all this time - glad to see you live, sometimes even laugh.
Grog the troll asked us to get rid of his competitor, Marg.
Gratiana
Crates of Deathfog. How did they get here?
That&apos;s what did me in. Funny, it doesn&apos;t look like much.
Still... Why not. I suppose some stories were always meant to be told.
Oh hi! Everything okay? You like it here? I like it here. &apos;part from the smell. But you know, the only thing worse than a bad smell is no smell at all.
Don&apos;t disturb me again unless you&apos;ve seen Migo.
*You are a man - a human man. They&apos;ve called you a Paladin for most of your life. As the blade slices through your neck, a single name echoes through your mind: &apos;Arhu&apos;.*
Take whatever time you need to gather yourself, my friend. When you are ready, we can proceed.
*Smile and say you most certainly wouldn&apos;t! Sebille the Magnificent? She&apos;d be more popular than Lucian ever was.*
And Lohar? Even the gallows are too good for that rat, let alone a cell! So how about you make certain he gets his just desserts?
Eyes are upon you, even in shadow.
You want me to spoil the story before you see how it ends? I&apos;d never be so rude!
*Remind him that the Divine Order put a collar around his neck and stuck him on this desolate isle.*
*Wonder what she did to get locked up in here.*
*Suggest she has the question wrong. It&apos;s &apos;does anyone &lt;i&gt;hear&apos;.*&lt;/i&gt;
Wings
Amyro may know of a way out of the fort. We&apos;ll have to free him from Griff&apos;s cage.
Spirit of Wyvlia
It is a union years in the making. Of course I am eager! But it is her safety that concerns me as well.
What did I do to deserve this?
This sturdy Dwarven shield bears the scratches and dents of many past battles.
*Tell her the Lady Vengeance looks as good as new. Ask how she managed to repair it.*
*Growl...* Mommy&apos;s dead. Mommy&apos;s dead and someone&apos;s gonna pay.
&apos;Fast&apos; most certainly being the operative word.
*The verdant pools encompass you. There is nothing else, nothing but Rhalic&apos;s eyes.*
Such &lt;i&gt;power &lt;/i&gt;she had!
*The spirit of a Paladin stands before you. He shoots you a hostile glare.*
You did well, my prince. You killed the Red Princess and destroyed her pretty little egg. I had not expected that you would have the fortitude, but so you did!
Animators Reference: WD WeaponSet
*The young woman squeezes her eyes shut in terror, but says nothing. The executioner raises his blade.*
There are feathers inside...
*Nod in acknowledgement, and say you seek to get rid of your scar.*
*A weary Paladin strips equipment from the bodies of the dead, singing softly to himself. He looks you up and down, then nods a greeting.*
I&apos;ve little for sale beyond the very history of our people. I sell not just goods, but memories that can&apos;t be restored through flesh alone.
Path is interrupted!
Well give it here, &apos;n&apos; be quick about it!
Aye?
I do so enjoy being proven right.
She may be rising through the ranks, but even princes can be thrown from their thrones. Or so I&apos;ve heard.
If you&apos;ll excuse me, darling, I have quite a bit of planning to do.
*You hear a shout and turn. Dwarves are being pushed aside as Magisters race towards you - shouting about &apos;Magister Shanda&apos;s effects.&apos; Panic fills you. You&apos;re running...*
You shouldn&apos;t have seen that...
Many a great noble perished in that sudden hell. As for myself, I&apos;m glad I lived to tell the tale, just like Sadha bid me to.
*Her hand slides into yours and you are whisked away, far across the oceans and the forests and the mountains, to a city on a dusty plain. You&apos;re in an alleyway, dark and dank, and you wear a hood.*
I don&apos;t know why daddy wouldn&apos;t let me play with that cat. Why does &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; get to have all the fun?
*Run to her and kneel down beside her, trying to lift her.*
*Dallis collapses. There is neither fanfare nor dirge - the Hammer is simply gone, victim to the Doctor&apos;s cruel whim.*
She presumed she had them in thrall...
*Say you&apos;re merely a traveller.*
Sworn Ancestor Tree
Orange Noxious Bulb
*Decide it&apos;s probably best to take your leave.*
That Isbeil. She. Will. &lt;i&gt;Pay.&lt;/i&gt;
I pledge my life, O Lucian. Please return.
You just picked the wrong fight!
*A searing pain suddenly shoots through your arm. You cannot see where it&apos;s coming from, but it feels as if a red-hot needle is grafting patterns into your skin: an ancient name in an ancient alphabet.*
The Spirit of a Corrupted Ancestor Tree
Isn&apos;t it... odd? Being a god?
Deal [1] and set Atrophy: your target can&apos;t use weapons or weapon skills anymore.
*Say you&apos;re having second thoughts actually.*
I wonder if someone will survive the Path of Blood this year.
Whisperwood Seedling
Listen up. Hand over what&apos;s mine and take your disgusting thief of a friend with you, or say goodnight.
*A faint shimmer remains about the totem.*
It&apos;s odd, seeing you here among my things, my practice. Usually it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;who visits &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
*You grab the dwarf&apos;s old, brittle arm and follow through with your knee. There&apos;s a dry snapping sound as the crumbling bone cracks and gives way.*
I&apos;ve been a good friend to you, Sebille - despite my lineage. A little gratitude is the least I deserve.
Malady brought us to the arch-demon&apos;s real home.
Laughing to me? I having an injurious brain-way.
*Ask your God to intervene - just once. You don&apos;t want to be left weakened by some God.*
[LOHSE] *Tell him justice awaits it all. You know this &lt;i&gt;deep down in your heart.*&lt;/i&gt;
*He turns his head. And then - silence.*
Please, help yourself to anything you want from our luggage. If there&apos;s anything left to salvage.
*Cling tighter to the spirit. Slowly pressure it to move further back through its memories.*
*Scold him for wasting perfectly good wine.*
Isbeil&apos;s Deathfog lies hidden in Arx, ready to devastate the city.
Three Magisters vanished so far, all within Driftwood. My comrades believe some tinkerer named Higba is behind it all, but they&apos;re wrong - I&apos;m certain of it!
Much has happened since you were away. I was Sworn to the God King, but no longer: with a Swornbreaker I was set free!
Mysterious Letter
Yes! I know that hunger in your eyes. Don&apos;t hesitate, champion! This was meant to be.
*Take your leave.*
Even an amateur tanner could make a lovely piece of leather from this beautiful hide.
Not so fast. &lt;i&gt;Name?&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell Kemm he&apos;s missing a painting.*
...and soon, the Dwarves will dominate the stage!
Axe Of Doom
I am Tir-Cendelius, most magnificent of the Seven, and you &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; kneel before me!
Trap Disarming Kit
Should she come close to ascension, you may not hesitate. Stand ready to end her, even if it breaks your heart.
*Coyly shake your head. Tug on &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;clothes instead.*
Go ahead. It&apos;ll be you that dooms us all, then.
I saw what you did there. Convincin&apos; Burro not to lay down the law on that elf. Anything for a fellow Sourcerer, isn&apos;t that right?
Nonsense. We&apos;ve already cheated death coming here. We have but to cheat the living to leave.
PAPA?!
You must make them teach you, so that you may become a Master in turn.
A long sword that exudes death from hilt to tapered tip.
