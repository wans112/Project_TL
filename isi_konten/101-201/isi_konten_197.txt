*Let him go free.*
The Irrefutable Point
*Assure her you can protect them.*
Do you suppose? Well, I guess it couldn&apos;t hurt. At very least, it&apos;s nice to have good company.
Lohse. &lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt;
Master dead.
Believe me, Lohse. I came here to help you become the person you&apos;re supposed to be.
Scounnnnndrel! Dastaaaaaaaard! &lt;i&gt;Liaaaaaaaaaar!&lt;/i&gt;
*Howl!* My poor Emmie. We&apos;re not used to being apart like this. It&apos;s... it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;awful&lt;/i&gt;.
I had a vision while I hung from this tree, halfway between this realm and oblivion.
A few of your kin managed to escape to Kemm&apos;s estate. The rest...
*Say you have some bad news. Atusa has been found out by some higher-ups and killed.*
*Show her the invitation to the wedding, the one that belonged to Lohar.*
*Shaking his head clear of reverie, the Red Prince turns to thank the spirit of the Dreamer for its aid. The old soul concludes its melody, and with it, its stay upon this world.*
*Chuckle in spite of yourself. There are some good lines in that one!*
Nothing of mine needs testing. Pay or walk - just don&apos;t waste any more of my time.
What part of &apos;talk sense&apos; passed you by? I ain&apos;t killing our brothers and, if I stay right here, they ain&apos;t killing me.
Watermelon
*Respond in the same tone: &apos;Oh, how we &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;suffer...&apos;.*
Scarred by battles of yesteryear and the rusts of this summer&apos;s rain, this blade looks fit to disintegrate in your grip.
Crafting Bible, Part XI
[FANE] *Repeat the creature&apos;s prayer: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Liberty cannot be offered one without being offered the many.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Scoff and say that a rent heart is a feeble heart.*
If you don&apos;t do this, there&apos;s no point continuing. You might as well walk right up to the demon and offer him your soul on a silver platter. I won&apos;t be party to it - I will respect your decision, but it will be the end of this little adventure in the demon&apos;s realm.
Blood Sucker
Excellent. Now if you&apos;d be so kind as to gut that startled-looking Magister, it would be much appreciated. I must secure my home before they do any more damage.
Compound Crossbow
Leave me be, elf.
*Say that the Kingdom is reaping what it has sown by stealing from the poor and giving to the rich.*
Melted Dwarf
*The spirit waits, his mind lost to memories of Sadha - and his bungled mission.*
Are you the new servant, then? My my. You look like a farmpig dressed up in toddler&apos;s clothes. You&apos;ve brought my tea, have you?
Well, sugar... now that you should mention it. *Inhales deeply* I do... I do smell something quite... delicious... on you. Almost smells like a Magister I once knew. One I never could convince to visit me here...
*She reaches out and places a hand over your heart. As she does so, you can feel a whole new power invade and expand your spirit.*
Well met. Jahan&apos;s my name. Pleasure to meet you.
Yes! I think you can, yes!
You want the Mother Tree dead? Quite the change of heart since last we met!
*Now free, the arm thrashes furiously. It doesn&apos;t relent until wriggling out of your grasp.*
Life... or the eternal Void.
I protect the Godwoken from many dangers, but not from other Godwoken.
That creature... it&apos;s not Donna. Not anymore. It&apos;s the Magisters&apos; property. Let them handle it.
Compete in the arena.
If you can hear me - demon, ghost, whatever you are - know this: &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; own this body.
*Stand tall. What does she intend to do?*
...their social norms I never could disparage.
Scales With [1]
*See what he has to offer.*
What could possibly best the greatest act of necromancy ever performed? &lt;i&gt;Reversing it,&lt;/i&gt; that&apos;s what. Here - take Anathema, and keep it close. Without it, you are nothing to Braccus.
Halt, traveller, if you please.
Vampirism? A dark skill. And one I find myself even more opposed to now.
Character cannot be healed.
*Ahem* Thugs. Heh. Look at it this way: People get lawless here, and we all starve.
Allow me - this way I can be sure you don&apos;t go &lt;i&gt;wandering &lt;/i&gt;on your way out.
*Note that you&apos;ve heard much about Lord... &lt;i&gt;Master &lt;/i&gt;Arhu. He sounds like a very good master.*
It&apos;s written all over you. In truth, I&apos;m glad to see it. A joyful god is a just god.
The Sworn one triumphed. But they reneged on my Covenant. I, the God King, seized their soul. They met... oblivion.
Um, no! I&apos;m a lizard. I just didn&apos;t grow my scales yet.
*Leave the cat to its mumbling.*
We opened a portal further into the temple.
*Pull the food away.*

Isbeil betrayed Queen Justinia and imprisoned her - and us - in her laboratory.
Ship Lower Deck in High Waves 01
Step careful as you disembark! Wouldn&apos;t want you to get hurt as you die upon the dock!
*Tell him she isn&apos;t coming back.*
*Shrug and take your leave. This isn&apos;t your problem.*
*Claim that you were just going to move it someplace safer.*
*Ask if the city is open.*
I suppose he was. Perhaps if he&apos;d been a bit &lt;i&gt;less &lt;/i&gt;honourable, he might&apos;ve found a way to survive.
Poor fellow&apos;d have an attack of the bloody flux if he knew what was &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; going on.
Mahiole
*Suggest he leave for the Hall of Echoes.*
Hgnn...
Magical Two-Handed Double-Headed Axe
Yes, sir!
I was... abandoned. Yes.
Rotate item
Dukes Up
Exactly. Should you and the Red Princess unite, it would usher in a new dawn of dragons. This must never be.
Untrack Quest
We need to act. &lt;i&gt;Now.&lt;/i&gt;
Righteous
*Say you&apos;ll do as you like and reach for your weapon.*
Scroll debug view down
...and before you ask: No. I don&apos;t have one. Even &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;have a modicum of decency. Deep, deep down.
*Deny any knowledge.*
Please, please, please, shut the &apos;ells up.
*Quickly change the subject. You like her song!*
*Steer the conversation elsewhere.*
Ma just fought off &lt;i&gt;four &lt;/i&gt;Voidwoken.
[SOLDIER] *Presume that this kin&apos;s treachery has been great... or the regime is run by the pettiest of tyrants.*
Fane retrieved his Mask of the Shapeshifter.
*If you had tears they&apos;d mingle with those of the goddess down in the tranquil, crystalline pond.*
Formation
Die_Gen_1
*The longer you gaze, the more your inner Source churns. You are drawn into her. Her mind, her body, her past. They are no longer hers, but yours.*
*Nod to the groom. You&apos;ll see what you can do.*
Well, sugar... now that you should mention it. *Inhales deeply* I do... I do smell something quite... delicious... on you. Almost smells like a Magister I once knew. One I never could convince to visit me here...
Bring it on. Combat is demanding, and your foes are devious and observant; for every surprise you spring, they will respond with two of their own. Not for the faint of heart!
*Apologise and say you haven&apos;t.*
I&apos;m not talking to the likes of you, buddy. Someone with a bit more authority rather.
*&apos;They&apos;? Ask who did this to her.*
Maybe we can get out of here now, if this thing&apos;s awake. I want to put some open sea between us and Dallis.
You can recap all tutorial messages by viewing the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Tutorial Log&lt;/font&gt;.
You should watch who you mess with!
In the Hall of Echoes, my god had weakened. Time is short. I have gained Source Vampirism - the ability to consume the Source of the dead.
Void Rift
*Refuse.*
&lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;song, of courrrse. Trrrouble not my wearrry mind with duncery!
You teleport away - this is not a polite way to end a conversation!
*If he doesn&apos;t know, maybe this isn&apos;t such a good idea after all.*
Yet so quickly, we find Source so dangerous. What in his death caused it?
[VILLAIN] *Suggest he give her what she wants. There must be a necromancer around here somewhere...*
I doubt that very much. Nice try, though.
&lt;i&gt;You e&apos;er hear the wild Beast jus&apos; sails on the ocean?&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s docked in the bay and comin&apos; your way...&lt;br&gt;Off in the yon you hear the commotion,&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s docked in the bay and comin&apos; your way...&lt;/i&gt;
Glowing runes mark this pyramid as an item far out of the ordinary. Using it will teleport the wielder to the location of a near-identical pyramid.
I &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; the device the Divine himself ordered.
*Her mouth remains closed, yet her voice settles in your mind like a damp fog.*
*Demand to know what happened here.*
Creates a glowing artefact around the edges of bright areas. Disable this if you don&apos;t like the effect. Disabling this does not yield a whole lot of a performance boost.
That&apos;ll be Forrex - I&apos;ve met no finer Wizard.
Hail, good woman. Bringing excellent word?
Our sacred Ancestor Trees... turned into the slaves of warmongers...
&apos;Here lies an unknown songstress.&lt;br&gt;Who sang in the night and did beguile us.&lt;br&gt;We found her body in the morning.&lt;br&gt;We are glad to give her rest.&apos;
I suppose we owe you our thanks for this. Stay a true friend to the Magisters, and perhaps one day salvation will be yours.
*She swallows hard and closes her eyes for a moment, as though trying to dispel a dizzy spell.*
I-... I think there might be a way. A way we could be intimate. But it requires absolute trust.
It is said to be a hollow place - stone and fire and filth. I go even so.
*Ask how she came to be cursed in the first place.*
Forbidden Ritual
And perhaps, just perhaps, I can find a way to bring my people back.
Painting of Zorl-Stissa
[HERO] *Say that you know exactly what he means. Since Fort Joy, everything has changed.*
*Tell him he shouldn&apos;t hang around here too long. It doesn&apos;t seem safe.*
...sssssssssmooooth.
We... ascend, I suppose. Or someone does. I mean, your guess is as good as mine at this point. &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;should be askin&apos; &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; not the other way around.
*Refuse to snuff out the candle. Refuse to send Prudence into oblivion.*
*Every spirit bound to the armour appears, the Dreamer first among them. She turns to you, alert and aglow.*
Oh - yes!
Indeed. I have seen them sketched and chronicled in ancient texts, but I took them for myths or hallucinations.
Tovah, the leader of the elven band, is dead.
And yet, my future looks much more hopeful than yours.
*Introduce yourself as the Red Prince and ask if she&apos;s as honoured as you are.*
Let me tell you the one truth about our existence: we are the lions in a world of lambs.
I can hear voices, but I can&apos;t make them out.
There was no question about it: You had to weaken that vile demon. Well done.
Think the better of this.
This battle is won, my friend, but we still have a war to fight.  We&apos;ve undone the Great Acorn, but the Knights of Drey are still out there.
This is a terrible, terrible place.
*Tell him that you found the painting, and hand it over.*
You have what you hoped for, for you still live.
*Ask what he meant by his &apos;former comrades&apos; - who did he serve...?*
[1] allows a character to backstab with Daggers and Knives.
*He inspects the coin, then drops it in his pocket and shuffles away with an embarrassed whimper.*
Giant Water Amphibian
The Doctor possessed Lohse.
No more shall I dance on the ocean. The end is almost here.
Look at me. Hard. What do you see?
&apos;Driftwood&apos;
We defeated Dallis in battle for the second time. A great feat indeed.
*The elf glares at you with alarm.*
Griff&apos;s Potato Peeler
I&apos;m on protection duty. I can&apos;t talk to you.
*Reach out and take his hand. You&apos;re together, and that feels right.*
