I told him of Braccus&apos;s cache of soulforged weapons - arms not even the Shriekers could stand against. He ventured out to find them, but has not returned.
Hmm. You hardly seem the sin-free type, but it looks like you&apos;ve gone and walked the Path anyway. Impressive.
Decide: be the true hero and give up your Source... or be forced to submit, like a coward. &lt;i&gt;Like a slave.&lt;/i&gt;
Nether Swap
Why didn&apos;t you say so in the first place?
*Refrain from answering.*
*The look on his face softens and he gives you a bittersweet smile.*
I knew it, from the first time I met you. I knew you were special. And this proves it.
*Glare and walk away.*
The victim was attacked by an old woman.
This isn&apos;t the Ancient Empire, serpent! Now answer my bloody question - what are you doing here?!
Och. I&apos;d say ya cut me to the bone, but truth is more like a bludgeon, ain&apos;t it? Maybe I could do me part to help yer... efforts.
*Tell him the hunger he gave you hasn&apos;t abated. If anything, it has increased.*
Time for a song!
My offer still stands, Godwoken - sharpen your wits, at the expense of a little constitution. More than fair in my estimation.
Light Suit
Pants of Mercy
*Promise her you&apos;ll do so.*
Embodiment of Zorl-Stissa
Frankly unremarkable in every possible way; you wonder why you even bothered to pick it up.
*Note that he&apos;s very harsh on his son, and demand to know what &lt;i&gt;he&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; achieved.*
The captain&apos;ll put you to work right smart, if you&apos;re offering. Pay you well for it too.
With the aid of the Demon Divine and his vast demonic armies, the God King was pushed back into the very depths of the Void. But he was never truly defeated. Still, the new Divine was hailed as the greatest hero Rivellon had ever seen.
You should not teleport away like that as I speak to you!
I wish you only healing.
Letter to Dallis
Haymaker
*Take the dagger and pocket it. No sense in letting a good dagger dirty...*
*No wax pools at the candle&apos;s wick, though it grows brighter as you inspect it.  A feeling comes over you - there&apos;s a soul within this flame, within the black wax that fuels it.*
*Bid him continue.*
Defender
[1] cannot flee because enemies are too close
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry - you&apos;re out of cash.*
[SCHOLAR] *Mention that you wouldn&apos;t mind seeing some of these texts for yourself... where might they be?*
You are in the wrong place. Pinkie.
Marrow
Run, you fools!
Grebb gave one of us a Void-tainted fish called Yellow Ridgeback to consume. It made us horribly ill, but Grebb informed us that we can combine the species with Alertness herbmixes in order to increase their potency.
*You emerge on the prow of a fine ship. Your armour pulses with enchantment, dominating those who draw near.*
Yes. A great many things. Days long gone...
*Let the God respond.*
Fane will go his own way. Is this for the best? Time will tell.
Pray, speak.
*Tell him you aren&apos;t looking for company at the moment.*
*Say she&apos;s found quite the location to hide in.*
Return to the demon.
Your Majesty. The Godwoken is no ally, but enemy. He would throw your plans in disarray&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;You have worked so hard. Arx &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; fall to the Deathfog.
What a strange thing for someone like &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; to worry about.
*The great sea-dragon bows its head, as if resigned to its approaching death.*
*Shake your head. Is this what his parents would want - for him to succumb to unbridled rage?*
Poison resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
*This is going nowhere. But if there is going to be bloodshed, she should at least give you a chance to defend yourself.*
*Tell her the truth: Never ever.*
Torso
*Allow him the time to collect his thoughts.*
Shadow Essence
Uhm. Yes. I-... I&apos;ll see you again? I suppose...
GUARDS! Help me! Help me! Why isn&apos;t anyone coming... I&apos;m being good! I&apos;m being GOOD!
*Tell her she&apos;s got that right.*
The Flight of the Phoenix
End this suffering, I beg you!
[NOBLE] *Firmly state that you come from highly respectable and &lt;i&gt;influential &lt;/i&gt;stock. If he cares about his future career prospects at all, he ought to release you immediately.*
Look over there, shiny-light. Do you see them? The mist-steps? Each one is an echo of Lucian&apos;s dreams, praise be his. They lead through the silver puffs and into the Hall.
*Tell her you aren&apos;t sure...*
Lohse returned to her music and enjoyed a storied career as Rivellon&apos;s premier musician.
We&apos;re only as strong as our weakest link, so let&apos;s go find &apos;em.
Lucian, I pray thee absolve my sins and find me worthy. The time of reckoning is upon us; the Hall awaits only the chosen. May the Deathfog cleanse me, as it cleanses the land and waters...
Search for the magic portal.
*Shrug and leave him to it. It&apos;s no skin off your teeth.*
*Pluck forth a sinew or two of the rotting entrails of his former master. Take a bite.*
Well now, what&apos;s this little enigma?
[The book speaks in general terms about opening oneâ€™s eyes to the glory of the Source... but then... your eyes begin to tingle. Everything becomes brighter, sharper; blacks and whites become glorious bursts of colour, then fade back into their accustomed spectrum. You know that now you may speak this spell &lt;i&gt;and see...]&lt;/i&gt;
*Fane pauses, taking your hand in his.*
It was an accident. Hannag didn&apos;t mean any harm.
The time for action is near. As Lucian said, &lt;i&gt;&apos;We are only as strong as the company we keep.&apos; &lt;/i&gt;We will make each other stronger.
Thunderbolt Grenade
*He gives you a searching look.*
We need to hurry; the boat&apos;s going to sink!
*The bunny gives you a dazed look, then turns away.*
*The skeleton tries to brush the dirt from his clattering bones, then frowns. The moistest bits are still stuck in his cracks and crevasses.*
*He struggles to free himself, but the knots hold fast.*
Oh, I&apos;m ever so pleased you changed your mind, given that it&apos;s cost me my place on the Lord Dread!
*You feel the short straw and hear them shout: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Kinnet!&apos;&lt;/i&gt; You know what that means: a lonely traipse in the cold dark. You dawdle and grumble all the way... sobering as you find the overturned caravan.*
*The ghost jerks away as if stung, but you have it in your grasp. Higba&apos;s face twists in agony as you drain his spirit of every last piece of Source.*
Much has been sacrificed so that we could make it this far. The people on this list are in esteemed company.
*Ask what they plan to do with Alexandar.*
I can&apos;t remember much. Just that voice. That damn voice...
What care I of Braccus? Tell us, invasive carcass, does the harlot Gratiana share his bed still? Does she still serve his wicked desires?
*Excuse yourself and say you&apos;ll pay these Seekers a visit.*
&apos;Driftwood, 1241&apos; is written by hand on the bottle&apos;s otherwise blank label.
*The hatch yields, clicking open.*
So why don&apos;t you tell me all about my valiant rescuers - to whom do I owe my thanks?
Reform my ways...? How &lt;i&gt;adorable!&lt;/i&gt; No, I&apos;m afraid I cannot escape who I am, and what I&apos;ve done...
All that knowledge, and still nothing to help us against the acorn.
*Shrug. Maybe later then.*
*Ask her about how the Magisters caught up with her. How did her Source manifest?*
*The third dial bears the same options as before...*
Between haves and have-nots alike, dwarves are fiercely nationalistic. Even the poorest dwarf would die for their dwindling Kingdom. But not all would die for the Queen...
I want you.
Then our little chat is done. And to think I called you persuasive.
*Tell him he&apos;s clever.*
&apos;Cheese Please.&apos;
*You close your eyes... and you feel the presence of a hidden truth. You point at it... and open your eyes. You are pointing at Dallis. The Hammer calmly bids you try again, then steps back into the shadows.*
You&apos;re not &apos;elping. *Cough.* Weirdo.
*Resist the God King. You will not do his bidding!*
*You stare at the corpses. They seem... &lt;i&gt;familiar.&lt;/i&gt; You remember... screaming. Then it hits you - you remember Bloodmoon Island, when the Advocate gave you the gift of the Source...*
My name is unnecessary and my House is cloaked in shadow. My intention? Why dear Prince, it is no more or less than to find the Red Princess Sadha herself. You&apos;re familiar with her, I presume? Heh.
*She whips her head and fixes you with an intense look.*
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry to hear that and take your leave.*
I find only bread. I want no trouble.
*Say you&apos;ll stay.*
Pearl
Extra
Oh, do you still not see? Even though you are a Godwoken, destined to be a god?
Tortured Corpse
*Ask why she and the others are holed up in this dank cave.*
*Eloisa was the prettiest girl. Not to others, but to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Her luminous eyes shone brighter than the moon. The day you collared her for Fort Joy you wept every tear you had. You never cried again.*
Would that Lucian were with us still. Void would never dare trespass while the Divine walked this sacred city.
With [1], certain statuses caused by you are no longer blocked by Magic or Physical Armour, and their duration is extended by one turn. Burning, Poisoned, Bleeding, Necrofire, Acid, Suffocating, Entangled, Death Wish, and Ruptured Tendons are affected by this talent.
Spirit of Anhar
*The tallest, strongest elf, whom you take to be the leader, gives you a side-long glance... and then turns away.*
Lohar&apos;s Head
*Reach out and lay a reassuring hand on his shoulder.*
*She bursts into tears. Ben looks from you to her and back again... then starts crying too.*
If I knew that, we&apos;d have taken him out long ago. All I can say is, he&apos;s somewhere in Driftwood... and everything he touches turns into annihilation.
You look like a girl to me.
Lucian and the Deathfog robbed our people of this glory.
*He looks about him. Gulps.*
Rats.
Look at you. &lt;i&gt;Magnificent.&lt;/i&gt;
The chef? What nonsense. If you had any proof of that you&apos;d be reporting it to Magister Carver, not me.
You have been to the earthen depravity that is Bloodmoon Island, you have seen in what villainy the enemy relishes! And yet you say no: no to a chance for the whole world&apos;s redemption.
Whaddya after, pipsquawk?
Don&apos;t like it... don&apos;t like it... don&apos;t like it...
&apos;Long of beard and short of stature&apos;. Hmm, it&apos;s not the most original description of Duna. I hope he won&apos;t take offence.
We&apos;ve all been living a lie... and fighting to preserve it. I feel sick.
*You are a Scion of the elves. The Mother Tree demands your blood. You do not have a choice - she has a plan and you must serve her with your death. You heed your mother&apos;s wishes and take root.*
Some Sourcerers have had Magister help in escaping the Fort.
[DWARF] *Tell the Knight to stop beating himself like that - this is a sacred place for your people.*
*Tell her about the sanctuary.*
*The happy cub ambles away. You watch it go.*
Creatures of the Void speak only to Godwoken. The beast taunted you. It knew you. It named you.
A key found in Lagan&apos;s locker.
The Essence of Existence, Volume Three
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the four statues behind us.
Cut off a demon&apos;s head and an &lt;i&gt;arch-demon&lt;/i&gt; rises from the bloody stump. Typical.
Thanks to you, Lohse, a new age is soon to dawn.
Thanks. Thanks very &apos;uch. You won&apos;t regret it. Or to &apos;ut it another way; you&apos;ll not live to regret it.
*Tell her you&apos;ll be by her side all the way.*
General
I am the new Divine.
