But you. I have nothing left to offer you. Someone took the last of my things. My good things.
You must realise, dear one, that our fates are now as one, just as our souls are now as one. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; are &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;.
Jahan will want to hear of the Advocate&apos;s death.
Magilla
Are you sure you&apos;ve done everything you meant to do here? I could&apos;ve sworn you had a Lone Wolf to hunt down, or some such. We won&apos;t be returning here, you know.
I reached a new level of mastery over my Source powers, thanks to the Scion Saheila. My destiny comes ever closer.
Pouch
The necklace! I knew it the second I laid eyes on you - you&apos;re going to pay, thief!
Please... Take it... I didn&apos;t...
*Tell her you have a spell that might ease her suffering. But first she and her friends need to calm down.*
*Look closer at the ruins reflected in her ghostly eyes.*
[IFAN] *Ice cold, stare down the fiend.*
I insist.
Speak with the Red Princess.
No... no...
The wife&apos;s got a sentimental attachment to that ring. Her mum took it off her dad&apos;s drowned body, here on this very beach.
But it&apos;s kind of fascinating... isn&apos;t it?
Freedom&apos;s the greatest gift of all. Let&apos;s hope it doesn&apos;t come back to express gratitude.
I   will   lick   you   from   the   floor.
*He chuckles at the cleverness of his not-very-clever comment.*
Wood Totem
Don&apos;t think your connections&apos;ll get here in time to save ya if you don&apos;t pay up. NOW.
*The Watcher sways slightly on dirty, bloodied boots. He stares straight ahead, no trace of awareness in his button-black eyes.*
Disappointing. We were just getting to know each other.
Wonderful! Now I have two, eh, &lt;i&gt;samples &lt;/i&gt;that I wish to study... care to choose which you&apos;ll try?
*Bid her stand. The prayer is hers, not yours. You&apos;ve chanted it often.*
Up in the Clouds
*Focus on her rage.*
Lucian returned as Divine, united the races, and became lord emperor of all Rivellon. Only Dallis knew that he was entirely powerless. Dallis and... you.
*He shrugs and continues the game with the mirror, inspecting inside his nostrils and around the backs of knees.*
Armour
The city&apos;s tearing itself asunder, and them Paladins are still going ahead with bloody &lt;i&gt;Lucian&apos;s Day&lt;/i&gt;. Ridiculous!
Exudes a poison cloud with a 2m radius.
Step inside.
*Laugh and shake your head. He&apos;ll have to do better than that if he seeks to provoke you.*
Distinctive Drudanae
Current security measures forbid me from providing the security question.
*He&apos;s offering you to teach you? Alright then, tell him to go ahead and teach you.*
But... but... Peeper baby... but Peeper baby &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;...
I &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;discover how to stop the Great Acorn. I will protect the creatures of this land - &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of them.
*Ask the child why he&apos;s out here alone.*
What is it, Red?
Consume
Helper_Stub_Box
No beast... no monster... merely an illusion... to be dispelled...
Amadia&apos;s strength waned when the Divine Lucian accepted the power of the Seven. This is most unusual.
I watch the gate. I watch the one who must be watched. I watch the one who should be dead, but can only be chained. I watch the gate.
Battering Ram
Large Mallet
Let the hunger pass through you, as poison is washed away by water. It must not win.
I can feel my Source power draining at the merest touch - tenebrium is truly a material of the Void.
Nah. No point moanin&apos;. You take what you get an&apos; you don&apos;t get upset. Amiright? I am right. Still, thanks an&apos; all.
Register with Magister William.
I watched them swallow bodies and then swallow souls. They fed on our flesh &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;our Source.
Find the missing eye.
But there are broad waters between should and shall at the present, and I&apos;m nothing if not a patient prince.
[HERO] *Tell the cub it&apos;s a bear. It&apos;s powerful, noble and true. It has what it takes to survive in this world, you guarantee it.*
This is not justice. Birdie does not deserve to die!
Birds Deep Forest 06
No. I would not.
Okay? How could I be okay? I had to choose between my people and yours. And, well...
I&apos;ll wait. But don&apos;t attempt to enter this house without first doing as I say. The results will be... disastrous.
Makes yourself immune to surfaces, as if you were floating.
*CLACK!*
[UNDEAD] *Are you mean? Emit a low growl...*
...Sorry, &lt;i&gt;Quercus &lt;/i&gt;believes - and I concur - that this magic can be used for light as well as darkness. Here, try this...
So? Have you seen anything?
Enough dillydallying, varlet. You got my tea?
It pains me to know the Black Ring preyed on my weakness. My hands are not yet clean of the victims&apos; blood. I will make amends. Somehow...
My tail rrrrattles like a snake&apos;s.
Magical Crossbow
*Confront Tarquin. What is this language? Can he understand it?*
*Tell her the Divine is dead; which answers does she expect to find in Arx?*
Can hold fluids. Or heads.
Matters more urgent than the honour of our houses? You shame us, kinsman.
Maybe so.
We&apos;ve certainly made a splash, haven&apos;t we? Let no-one say otherwise.
Bomber AI
*Demand to know where the queen is.*
I swore an oath. This oath I defended to my grave... I will continue to defend it until such time as the gods themselves deem it fit to end my vigil.
[FANE] *You have a high opinion of yourself in most things. The Voidwoken don&apos;t seem to think much of you, though...*
Sign
It&apos;s a recipe for Wyvlia&apos;s stew: a list of names intended for death.
Water
I sell only the best stuff, dwarf. I doubt you can afford it.
Combat Abilities
This is so, but without Gareth to lead them they are lost and listless.
I&apos;m not interested in your bribe!
I feel it! I feel it, and now I know what it means. You speak true. The Mother is dead! We are free!
&lt;i&gt;Hear and heed my call, my love, your hand is mine to hold; hear and heed my call, my love, I&apos;ve secrets to unfold.&lt;/i&gt;
Sourcerer&apos;s Shell
Of course Source must still be harvested, the Eternals must survive, but the cruelty of the Seven is over.
Did yeh hear they got the tinker? What&apos;d I tell yeh? The Magisters save us from one more lunatic!
There are enemies ahead! Try sneaking around by pressing [IE_ToggleSneak]. If you walk into their &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;sight range&lt;/font&gt;, you will be spotted and combat will start.
Fish Factory Office Door
Topaz Necklace
Tailor
I told him at noon exactly! Didn&apos;t I...?
Well well well, what have we here? Looks like someone&apos;s taking a holiday in a prison cell!
Spirit of Magister Inquisitor
Eternal Warrior Weapon
Wits Lowered
Do me a favour and take your - erm - &lt;i&gt;guest &lt;/i&gt;outta here, eh?
Cavern Green
Whoa. &apos;scuse me. Where was I?
Increased Wits
With no new Divine, Malady found herself in a predicament.
Target is too heavy
&lt;i&gt;you are the one to die YOU ARE THE ONE TO DIE&lt;/i&gt;
Fired like a prayer, this blessed water arrowhead might be just the divine intervention you need in a hot situation.
*You can take no more. Look away.*
Water Totem
Stunning Oil Grenade
The crimson petals of the blood rose smell like putrescent flesh and long-abandoned outhouses.
*Shut him up with a kiss.*
After the Great Pear Famine, this small fruit is considered a delicacy among elite circles.
*Say that you&apos;re in a hurry and could always just skip the niceties and take what you need by force. This is &lt;i&gt;important,&lt;/i&gt; godsdammit!*
Jahan Last Seen Here
*Tell him to knock it off with the questions.*
[SWORN] *Tell him you&apos;re yet to make up your mind. You&apos;ve heard the call of many gods.*
Your soul must grow bigger still; your inner self become a vaster expanse so that it may house divine power.
You&apos;re talkin&apos; to me, not her, Saam.
I&apos;ve never seen anything like this workmanship...
If the latter, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; has much to learn.
You are vermin; you will be cast out.
*Her expression hardens. She produces, in one hand, a dagger.*
*Say she can count on you to bring an end to the corrupted Knight of Duna.*
Charged Frog
Ah. You&apos;re here. Good.
Come, old chap, don&apos;t be unreasonable.
Commencing coward-flushing tactics.
Saheila
Lovrik, the waiter at the Black Bull, also deals in something... exotic.
Word gets around, does it? Well I appreciate the help. I won&apos;t forget it.
Please! Bring it back. We love our babies. We miss our babies. Our eggs will become little chicks! Yellow fluff and peep, peep, peep. Please!
Observe the Source radiating from the golem - we can&apos;t defeat it while it contains such power!
*Bow your head. You&apos;re sorry you couldn&apos;t do more.*
*He eyes you slyly, but consents to one final tale.*
This... this is a gift. Happy to have it.
I&apos;m all for a good tyrant, but Braccus grew too powerful. Worse, he grew by sucking the soul from the land.
Don&apos;t you realise he can still control me with the scar song? Make me a slave with a mere whistle?
What&apos;s on your mind?&lt;br&gt;
You... you&apos;ve been there? Smack in the middle of the lion&apos;s den? Crikey!
*As you approach, Rhalic greets you with a salute, though his face is marred by a pained grimace.*
Sssssay, lookie look lookie... &lt;i&gt;Sssourcerersss.&lt;/i&gt; Caged like little ickle sssquirmy wormsssss. Deliciousssssss...
Arx for Lucian&apos;s Day sounds nice, Mother.
*Remark that if he seems like a skilled individual - if his talents are being squandered here, then he ought to leave immediately.*
*Note that the ship is still bobbing in the shallows and ask when she intends to set sail.*
You actually thought you could bribe yourself into my good graces? You&apos;re under arrest.
Walking Disaster
We were not always like this - we were once a proud, upright people like yourself! Our princess was betrothed to marry Braccus Rex, the Source King!
Anathema is coming along &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;nicely, I must say.
[1]&apos;s Bag
Dangerous enough that she&apos;s gotta be kept in that fancy cell.
[IFAN] *Drawl &lt;i&gt;&apos;The pleasure&apos;s all yours.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*The little girl doesn&apos;t acknowledge your presence. She remains locked away somewhere, deep within her own mind.*
*Ask him why it is so important &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; should win. Surely any new Divine would do?*
*Raise your eyebrows. How&apos;d he come to know so many shanties featuring... you?*
I do not speak for the other divine champion. He may be a friend for now. He may not.
[ELF] *Say you understand - you&apos;d be a miserable elf if you didn&apos;t. Her secret is safe.*
*Sympathise with her tale. Maybe some trade would take her mind off it?*
You what? Wait... you&apos;re serious. &lt;i&gt;Alarm! Alarm!&lt;/i&gt;
*He nods at the satchel on the table with a smile and gestures for you to help yourself.*
Ifan was summoned to the Black Bull tavern to meet with a contact by the name of Baran.
I bet they&apos;re eating golden roe and high hog in the Ancient Empire right now, while we&apos;re making do with whatever we can scrape together. Bloody lizards.
A few. But you could taste the Magisters&apos; desperation. They even torched their own barracks to slow us down with the smoke. A lot of good that did, eh?
Dead Farmer
*Say you have a few more questions.*
I will be swayed by no-one - no God, no king. We must keep Arx safe!
Pull myself together? D&apos;yeh think I&apos;m not terrified? Outside this shrine, the dead walk. And they&apos;re the least fearful things in that swamp.
*Her mouth opens to form a perfect &apos;O&apos; of mock horror. Then she grins.*
Trying to get by with one foot in the grave? Or more than that, maybe? More than- than...
*Say you&apos;re glad. The captain owes you a favour for freeing him.*
&lt;i&gt;*Busy?&lt;/i&gt; Say that chickens don&apos;t know what busy means.*
