Worse, you were mistreated slaves. They allowed you to fight, to kill, to suffer. There will be no suffering in the world of the Eternals.
Iron Bones
*Ask the spirit how he would learn from his mistakes.*
Amethyst Deceiver Seedling
I owe my life to the holy pilgrim! If I knew his name, I would shout it from the rooftops!
Magister Axe
The rest is... gone. Someone should try and see what was done to me; nobody should be left to such a fate - &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt;.
Training Targets
We&apos;ll see about that, freshie.
*Tell him to hold off. You&apos;ll return later.*
[MYSTIC] *Reach out and touch Kinnet&apos;s forehead, your Source flowing.*
Old Plate
[ELF] *Armour from vines - say you know creation magic when you see it.*
*Shrug and state that trusting strangers is a good way to wind up dead, in your view.*
No such thing as the two of us, really.
Just so, just so! How very reciprocal. You see mysteries in the night; so do I, so do I! Oh, I&apos;m just your man!
Huh. Don&apos;t think I haven&apos;t thought about it. Find a husband, or a wife. Have a family.
Like a charm.
They lied to me... but of course, a fallen Eternal would say that. Perhaps the Gods had their reasons?
*Come on. Say there has to be more to it than that.*
*Be on your way.*
*Take it.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_4_5dac5eea-faeb-459c-b675-46c51519b784])
*She&apos;s right - you don&apos;t like the way your God has been acting. Denounce Amadia.*
Business. With the Godwoken...
She had horrors at her side. Shriekers, they calls them. They still protect the harbour, firing pure death at anything that catches their eyes.
*Hold a hand to your ear, feeling for the wound.*
Locks and Keys
*Tell her you&apos;re sorry, but Saheila has died.*
*This city seems to be tearing itself apart. Ask what&apos;s going on.*
No! Featherfang!
*There&apos;s a moment of silence before a shuddering sob runs through her entire body. She throws herself into Duggan&apos;s arms as he stares at you in shock.*
Always working so hard for a better world. A more perfect world.
*Tell her you understand how she feels.*
*Ask the door to open.*
Withermoore held his end of the bargain - we should hold ours.
Any minute now, they&apos;ll come. Any minute...
*Point out that Magister actions have sown discontent. There could be others like the cook...*
I was sealed in a tomb for daring to be curious about the world. It seems our King did not agree that the universe should be explored to its full potential.
An enchanted dagger having belonged to Dorotya. Its pommel is adorned with the shape of a spider.
We made it into the cellar. There&apos;s someone down here.
There are corpses everywhere - those of Paladins, Magisters, and Voidwoken.
I know he is a toad. A hopping little creature that follows Dallis wherever she leads.
&lt;b&gt;Excavation Log: Update #37&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... We  &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;i&gt; found it:The Aeteran! A contingent of Gheists and Whites immediately seized it and shipped it to Dallis. The overseers speak of medals of Lucian to be sent to us all!
[LOHSE] *Curtsey and tell her your name is Lohse.*
Bird &amp; Wind Forest 05
*She looks through you, eyes focused on something far away.*
Knaap
The Hammer&apos;s Pet
What are you insinuating? We&apos;re merchants, not mystics! You should have seen those Void monsters... all that blood, all that &lt;i&gt;death. &lt;/i&gt;They didn&apos;t deserve... we didn&apos;t...
*Tell him you&apos;re quite convinced, and ask where you can find the Well of Ascension.*
Magister Ranley, Caulker&apos;s Mate of the Divine Eminence vessel, &lt;i&gt;Lady Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt;
Garvan survived the Voidwoken attacked that killed his master. It might be worth recovering their supplies.
That cake... it came from the Doctor, with a letter of congratulation. It was truly a magnificent sight, but the wedding was cut short before we could even slice it.
Good, this town has enough problems.
Wait... you&apos;re leaving? Don&apos;t go! I&apos;ve got so much undeath still to live and so much wisdom to spread!
Stay safe out there, eh?
*State that you&apos;d like Duggan and his crossbow at your side.*
Corpse Explosion Stone Medium
*Invite her to carry on in spite of her remarks.*
Watch your tongue, you ignoramus! Her Royal Highness comes from a long and esteemed line!
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;BRIGHT CLAW&lt;/b&gt;.*
*Ask what the Black Ring is doing here.*
It&apos;s good to have Gwyd back. I couldn&apos;t bear to lose him again. To lose&lt;i&gt; anyone &lt;/i&gt;again...
*For the first time in what feels like forever, you feel safe. You know this is the statue&apos;s gift. You know the feeling will not last, but you are grateful nonetheless.*
[DWARF] [NOBLE] *One of Lohar&apos;s? &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;. Explain your extensive family connections to her. In detail.*
So you do comprehend...
*Demand to know where Isbeil is hiding.*
In the eyes of the God King, Fane was redeemed.
*Bat her hand away and tell her to leave you alone.*
My gratitude for your efforts, friend. Yet, I am no more free now than I was in those chains. Please, help me find true liberty or sing me to the endless slumber.
A man&apos;s word is as fragile as his skin or scales.

*Wait. Hold on. The gods once gave away half of their powers? Just like that?*
Got any other talents, besides getting in my way?
Destroying the soul jars that bind us here. There is no other way.
*A look of doubt appears on his face.*
*Say you don&apos;t feel strongly one way or another; you are just progressing through the game as it comes.*
I like a dwarf who knows what she wants and isn&apos;t afraid to take it. You&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. But let&apos;s take it slow. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
[SWORN] *Persevere. You cannot allow the God King his pleasure.*
I will tell you &lt;i&gt;NOTHING! &lt;/i&gt;My work is my legacy, and that of my fellows! I will &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;betray them!
*Ask why the Paladins attacked.*
*Call out to the dwarves - say you&apos;re not looking for trouble.*
&apos;Love is not the answer. Answer search continues...&apos;
Ah, you survived! How considerate. Come, let&apos;s see what other warm bodies we can find.
Don&apos;t be a stranger... there&apos;s wonderful things I could show you.
Yes - yes. You stand straight and tall - a sign of an honest man. This news does muddle things a tad...
Don&apos;t read too much into it.
Black Ring Spy
Fish Rack
*Tell him you simply prefer to move about without being assailed at every corner.*
If there&apos;s no rest fer the wicked there&apos;s plenty o&apos; rest for Lucian, m&apos;friend. So we oughta beg all the harder for his return!
The Druid&apos;s Bundle
Same little beauty the Order used to wipe out Black Ring with a side order of elves in the last war.
You wouldn&apos;t believe how much life is sustained by a little death...
*The air is silent and still around you. No movement, no life disturbs it.*
You again? You&apos;ve really got your nose on my scent. Well, shoo fly. We ain&apos;t friends.
Could you please go and be unbearable somewhere else?
Eh. You&apos;re boring. Don&apos;t you want t&apos;talk about anythin&apos; else?
Rings
*Ifan strides forwards and feints a punch at Alexandar&apos;s nose with his right hand. As the Divine Bishop raises his hands to protect himself, Ifan grasps both of his wrists and headbutts him.*
*She frowns and peers at you closely, concern clearly etched upon her face.*
You&apos;ve a heart as soft as a chicken&apos;s knee.
I know it&apos;s the same ol&apos; sea breeze I&apos;ve always smelled. But it&apos;s different now. Malady&apos;s gone. A demon&apos;s in charge. I don&apos;t know how to explain. Maybe you do.
*The spirit freezes in terror. Her eyes plead with yours.*
*He sighs dramatically.*
*Mention that a dwarf arena fighter named Murga admitted to fighting Magisters - perhaps she&apos;s behind the disappearances.*
*You&apos;re stumbling away from the shoreline, a deep wound in your side. Behind you, the remains of your ship slip beneath the water. You press on - you and the others...*
My big brother knows lots about Voidwoken. He says I smell like one.
Bock! Thanks for the feed, but don&apos;t think you can go scratching around here if you keep up that bad behaviour!
*Tell him that a runt like him has no business mocking anyone for their size.*
*Sneer. Is this her idea of a distraction from the championship?*
*The dwarf smiles, his eyes filling with warmth as he looks at Leya.*
*Shrug noncommittally and say you appreciate his vote of confidence.*
You truly are a pitiful creature. Swear to the Covenant once more, and you shall be returned in a form more befitting you and your failures. Refuse, and you shall die.
Gauntlets of Contamination
Warnings are over!
I spend enough time doing the work. I&apos;m not gonna waste any more &lt;i&gt;talking&lt;/i&gt; about it.
Do I look like I&apos;ve got time for gossip?
[HERO] *Say that he has no choice. If he knows anything it&apos;s his duty to speak - as it is your duty to save this man&apos;s life.*
Can&apos;t you say anything else? Bloody Magisters...
*She looks at you, smiles, and licks her lips.*
Cave - Crystal Mine B
[1] minute(s) and [2] second(s) remaining
No skin off my knuckles.
You&apos;ve found a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Magic Scroll&lt;/font&gt;! With it, you can cast spells you haven&apos;t yet learned.
No!
You&apos;re back! Do you want to talk about &lt;i&gt;trolls?&lt;/i&gt;
*Lohse&apos;s eyes roll back in her head. She groans; her face slack and lifeless while her body wracks with spasms. Jahan draws his palm back from her; she is rigid on the floor.*
Yet you chased away my pride and joy, dear Featherfall, from my remains. How long I&apos;ll wait to reach the Halls now.
*Draw your weapon and tell Grog that Marg sends his regards.*
I should keep a metaphorical eye out for the materials I need. Until then, I must keep my face covered.
Muted
We boarded the Magister flagship, the Lady Vengeance. We have escaped the island!
*Offer your help.*
Me personally? Nah. I hear it&apos;s boring. They may be you-know-what, but they sure as shite don&apos;t fight like it.
I&apos;ll make you bleed! I&apos;ll make you bleed from every &lt;i&gt;hole&lt;/i&gt; in your face!
*Your head shrieks as if split in two by the God King&apos;s umbrage - but you have overcome. Windego&apos;s Source funnels into you in steady gushes as you sling her spirit into the Void.*
I wish things had been different. I wish I had been able to save them without saving the evil that sustained them.
Left Bracket
*Say you don&apos;t know.*
It&apos;s time. Our fallen comrades will be avenged.
[IFAN] *Tell her you brought her Deathfog to the elves. And you&apos;re none too happy about it.*
The Doctor
We should keep our eyes on the prize: divinity...
We must tread carefully, I&apos;m sure such a wonderland will be dangerous. But at least it should be free from the Knights of Drey.
Just like everyone else. But don&apos;t worry. Nothin&apos; happens in this camp that Griff don&apos;t find out about, sooner or later.
*Raspy gusts of breath wheeze from the creature&apos;s badly mangled mouth as he lifts and drops cargo with automaton-like precision.*
*Offer your condolences.*
*Ask why the House of Shadows would try to stop the return of the red dragons.*
Vanquish the Voidwoken.
*About that trio of curios...*
*The dwarf recoils in horror as your Source whips around her. As you pull her towards you, you hear her whispering &apos;please, no&apos; before you suck her Source deep into your body.*
*Bid them stop; you will hear no more.*
Elven Arbalest
I&apos;ll Sourcer you, Dallis!
I suppose you paid your dues long, long ago. You... you will do, Ifan.
I thought you were unusually... uh... sober. And me dead drunk. Oh ye gods.
