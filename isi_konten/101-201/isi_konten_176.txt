Young Han went into the theatre and became one of the realm&apos;s most popular actors.
How curious. The Godwoken would defend her oppressor in the face of her &lt;i&gt;liberator?&lt;/i&gt;
I thank you, but of course we both know none of us will ever be truly free until the God King is defeated once and for all. Facing him will be... indescribable, but my offspring will help you!

Speak. &lt;i&gt;The word. &lt;/i&gt;The magic word. And I. Shall open.
*Tell him he can&apos;t talk: he kills for a living.*
*Unsheathe your weapon and prepare for battle.*
*She allows her memories to pass before you.*
We should seek the Meistr. Anyone with such a fine authoritative title should surely aid us on our journey.
*The elf&apos;s face falls a little - the chase is over, and he remains outside the Magister ranks.*
Wait... the spider! It was the spider! She... &lt;i&gt;chewed&lt;/i&gt; me. &lt;i&gt;Bits&lt;/i&gt; of me, slowly. I keep looking, but I can&apos;t find... myself.
Yours faithfully into eternity,
We found a collared boy in a cage. Nearby was an arrangement of braziers.
Alexandar is missing.
*Lay a hand upon the gem.*
*The bird&apos;s head droops miserably - there&apos;s no better offers on the horizon.*
We killed Beryl Griff.

So this is how it ends between us, then? I thought you better than that. I thought &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; better than that. Seems she&apos;s not the only one been swallowin&apos; lies.

*Say you aren&apos;t interested.*
Korgh, The Shipwrecked Pirate
As I prayed at an altar, a mysterious, fragmented voice acknowledged me as Godwoken.
*Close your eyes and allow it to embrace you once again...*
[1] cannot flee because there are no available waypoint shrines
Ha-HA! Too late! The contract has been sealed. You&apos;re mine! MINE! Muahaha!
&lt;i&gt;Get away from the door.&lt;/i&gt;
*Roll your eyes. More games, even now?*
Well, you&apos;re stuck with me now, lass.
You just bribed your way into an early tomb, criminal!
But first there is more to do. You are powerful, but not yet at your full potential.
Hey you, lookie here!
*Wonder what happens next for her.*
*Malady groans and collapses onto her back, her eyes fluttering.*
[SEBILLE] *Tell her not to worry. These pigs aren&apos;t long for this world.*
Fills my heart with gladness to know that there are still folks like him to be found now that Our Lord Alexandar has... fallen.

I&apos;ve forgotten &lt;i&gt;nothing. &lt;/i&gt;Alexandar, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the sinner, yet the Gods have allowed &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; to suffer for it. I would kill you a hundred times over if given the chance!
Is it not enough to do it to save us all from darkness? Very well, do it to regain the power you have lost.
*His mouth against your ear, he whispers:*
*Consume the spirits&apos; Source, all in one go.*
*Ask if he knows anything useful about the dungeon.*
She says there is a shelter in the marshes outside the fort. She says she brings us there first; she knows a safe path. We wait for a boat, and then we go... wherever we make a new home.
You are done here, Sourcerer!
With Sadha he had more dragons.
No-one in this world has escaped the madness unleashed by the King.
Come now. It&apos;ll only be a moment.
Well, I was &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to get a little taste of your flesh. I can tell a lot from a little morsel. But... you&apos;re fresh out.
*Tell him the Sallow Man is dead. You killed him.*
*Say that you can knock him aside and investigate for yourself if you wish to. He&apos;d be wise to just let you help him.*
*You hear a quiet sob from the fish.*
White Magister Reimond is in charge here. We may be able to trick him into helping us.
The howling. How can you &lt;i&gt;bear&lt;/i&gt; it?
Really? One&apos;s tongue ending up in one&apos;s sweetheart&apos;s left nostril isn&apos;t generally regarded as perfection.
I already told Callo to send you here from Driftwood. Not to mention the little fact that I am &lt;i&gt;the leader of a band of assassins&lt;/i&gt;. Come on!

So much time wasted.

Roost Anlon. I own this place. I&apos;d ask you to introduce yourself, but I already know who you are, &lt;i&gt;Ifan&lt;/i&gt;. Or do you prefer being called &apos;Godwoken&apos;?
*Red Prince and the Dreamer exchange courteous pleasantries, as if they&apos;re finding themselves in a palace hall instead of a death-ridden swamp. She introduces herself as Bahara.*
Aye, the coin&apos;s sweet, but the smell sure ain&apos;t. Mind you, the boss found a buyer for this lot, so my knife stays sharp and my pockets stay full.
*Run your finger along your weapon. That&apos;s a problem you can take care of, for sure.*
Aha- please, my dear. The *cough* the sergeant will lead.

Until we failed.
We tried to help your kind, and &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; help those&apos;t enslaved you? You&apos;re a wrong &apos;un and no mistake.

Aye, yer knife needs to be quick and true for these. It&apos;s easy to cut off the extra fins, but dancing yer blade around the tumours can be tricky.

The Search for Divinity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*An apparent addendum to a larger work, Cranley here recounts Dallisâ€™ search for a new Divine - a search that resulted in the firm conviction that Alexandar was the only possible candidate. All others were deemed to be fakes. Or worse: enemies.*
*Ask what happens if they manage to defeat the Magisters.*
I always figured every dwarf is pure of heart when they pop outta their mamas. We ain&apos;t born cruel - we&apos;re &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; cruel.

Yow&apos;re still here, when yow&apos;re s&apos;posed to be at camp. Get yow there, &lt;i&gt;and now.&lt;/i&gt;
Wait a sec... it looks like you have all the company you need. Maybe come see me when you&apos;re a bit more on the lonely side.
The Gods, the Godwoken, the Divine Order... all will be destroyed. Now leave, unless you want to meet the same fate that&apos;s coming for them.
*Ahem!* Terribly sorry. I&apos;m not in my proper mind today, it seems. I&apos;ll keep looking myself. Good day to you!
*Ask once again where he took Magister Brannt.*
What happened?
The Covenant will be kept...
Royalty, my friend. Royalty holds court here. You might think me crazy, but I&apos;ve seen the royal wardens patrolling these corridors. And as you can tell - they saw me. Pity really, that would have been a good score.
*Your body convulses with Zorl-Sitssa&apos;s displeasure. Your head pounds; your bones ache. Ryker&apos;s smile widens at the sight of your agony.*
*Bitter cold shoots up your fingertips, through your arm, shoulder, neck, and into your brain. Your whole body contracts with the aching freeze... and a voice sounds inside of you.*

Certainly there are. More ahead, aboard the ship. More about, collecting their weapons. But... I can&apos;t just leave them.
Hello, stranger. A strange person from a strange time. I wonder, do you even know how lost you are?
[JESTER] *While he&apos;s still laughing, tell him the one about the Silent Monk and the Frog King.*
Why yes, I&apos;m having a lovely day, thank you. Now kindly shut up and move.
*Tell him you like the feminine touch.*
But... I still choose you. We&apos;ve come this far together. Might as well go a little farther.

You received the Forest&apos;s Fortunate Talent.
Oh please, do you really expect me to put a travelling companion above my people? Above my family?
*Suddenly, she leans toward you with an unnerving creak.*
*Leave it be.*
*His sneer widens.*
The wizard&apos;s eyes snapped up from the heavy tome. Outside the small hut, the unmistakeable sound of a struggle erupted, and an orcish roar sent shivers down the wizard&apos;s spine. But now was not the time for fear. By the light of the moons, the orc&apos;s hulking silhouette was a boil upon the outline of the peaceful woods. He had pinned someone beneath one great knee, and the victim cried out in futile anguish. The wizard whistled. Turning its great head, the orc had only just noticed the distant figure before its great green mass erupted into a shower of ash. The would-be victim rose, dusting the orc from his hair, and held out a hand. The signet ring of the Order of the Source Hunters glinted upon his finger. &apos;Friend,&apos; he said, &apos;I was sent to find the great wizard of these woods. But it seems you found me first.&apos;
Alright, alright. But I like that one!
*They take the evidence. Then they reach for their weapons.*
You squirm closer. Fascinating...

Well anyway, I can&apos;t tell you how grateful I am for your kindness. Now, I&apos;m just trying to get used to life as a pig. It&apos;s not so easy. I never did enjoy truffles.
We ain&apos;t gonna keep you &apos;round much longer.

Hmm, it&apos;s coming... I am... I am nearly ready!
On your way then. But don&apos;t you think I won&apos;t still be watching.
Her rank doesn&apos;t matter, nor do her titles. My needle pierces all flesh equally.
