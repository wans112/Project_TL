It&apos;s clearly a trap. Better to strike now, while danger is minimal.
Hmm. Fine. I won&apos;t hold it against you this time. Not sure I&apos;ll be so generous if it happens again.
From [1]: [2][3]%
Pick Up and Add to Wares
Alexandar. He was true to his word, I&apos;ll give him that.
*A huge unseen force suddenly &lt;i&gt;slams &lt;/i&gt;her into the ground, flattening her form into a puddle.*
The Divine cannot use her power for anything else.
Receive an extra turn in combat for [4] turn(s).[2][3]
L-L-Lucian take these memories away...
How very kind of you! I&apos;d love some. The brutes in this establishment have scarcely glanced at my table, much less offered me anything.
Back off. Locals first. You want to make war you can eat elsewhere.
I said MOVE!
Shackles of Pain
Pants of Amnesty
Excellent, the pestilence has been cleansed. Resume your business.
[LOHSE] *Say you&apos;d give anything to feel ok again.*
I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s one of those &apos;Shriekers&apos;.
*He gestures to the canvas - it&apos;s completely covered in the same shade of red, layer after layer. It&apos;s sodden, dripping onto the cobbles...*
*Shrug. That sounds totally normal.*
When I invoke Lucian&apos;s words, I invoke his deeds, too. He stood for the defenceless when the Black Ring rose up. For all of us. For my mother, my father.
*Tell it you already have gold. You &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;information.*
Illusory Worn-Out Chest
*Frown and move to stride past him.*
That is not the first time I hear such a dimwitted excuse.
Fireball
[IFAN] *Tell her you know that betrayal well. Their loss pains you.*
Sahun Woundbinder
*Ignore the burning in your lungs and quickly explain what happened - your God hiding within you, your new power, and the Masters of Source*
[ELF] *Inform her that she&apos;s as boring as she is bored.*
*Look at him expectantly. The word doesn&apos;t ring a bell.*
*The beast scours its teeth across your soul. When the agony fades, the armour you wear is aglow with power.*
*Wrinkle your nose. Who would find a graveyard so delightful?*
So, you&apos;d rather die here and now than be cured, would you? Fine by me.
*Smiles.* Who needs thralls, when I have selfless acquaintances such as yourself?
*Tell Marg that you&apos;ve taken care of the competition: Grog is dead.*
*About the Lone Wolves...*
*Ask the child&apos;s name.*
Then it spread. Say a good word &apos;bout Lucian, and you just... disappeared. Artists were cleared from the streets, replaced by royal goons in full armour. The lizards would come, they said, and we should all be ready t&apos; take up arms if the queen demanded it.
A loyal servant. Loyal servant. I have no more answers. Master awaits you to the west. To the &lt;i&gt;wwweest!&lt;/i&gt;
Vile &lt;i&gt;elven wickedness!&lt;/i&gt; I ought not to give you any reward for your kind&apos;s filthy actions... but I&apos;m a man of my word...
*The spirit takes great pains to ignore you.*
Do you think people would still care for you if they knew the &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;you?
Our mission has a name: Adramahlihk. He is the fiend that possesses you, but worry not: we&apos;ll find him, and we&apos;ll undo him.
No Tier
My powers are depleted, Godwoken. There is nothing further I can teach.
*Her furrowed brows are as the storm before sun. Ask what has her in poor spirit.*
[LOHSE] *Tell her you&apos;re Lohse. She may not have heard of you, way out here in the back swamps, though...*
Just sing the song when the moment comes. Please.
No less than a slaughter! Nobles from the three houses were gathered there in anticipation of Lucian&apos;s Day when suddenly the ground shook, monsters howled for blood, and fires raged around us.
Happy travels, eh? What a crock...
Change Canvas
Welcome to the Forbidden Library. Do not fear the truth, though it smash your world to pieces. Do not fear the truth about the gods.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him you&apos;re the Red Prince. Obviously.*
My girl, I am exactly as I seem. You&apos;ve seen my true self. There&apos;s nothing more to know.
You&apos;ve been collared, and you&apos;ve been told why. There really is no need for you to linger.
Amadio
It seems the Queen can handle herself.
*The spirit utters another hiss, its beady eyes fixed on you angrily.*
Halt! I know you&apos;re up to something...
Book of Eternals
*Shrug. Tell the door you didn&apos;t know what you were doing. Jahan tricked you. It&apos;s not your fault.*
I can be bought, but I don&apos;t come cheap.
Capability is learnt. So too experience. What I need is not the wisdom of experience, but the fire of potential.
You! Who let you out of your cell? Come along - you&apos;ll be tried when you&apos;re called!
*Ask what the hell she&apos;d just done.*
*Nod. The Voidwoken, that&apos;s it. &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; got him.*
When the war comes I won&apos;t have it said that I fraternised with the enemy. So good day to you.
*The younger one&apos;s face goes pale and his eyes widen. The other remains stiff, as if bracing himself against an unseen wind.*
Enable this to prevent from accidentally clicking outside the window and unintentionally losing focus of the game window.
&lt;i&gt;Our master thanks you. Remember - seek out Sanguinia Tell...&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit searches about her frantically, her lips moving in the same pattern over and over, though no sound comes out.*
Nobody can deny that a knife on a stick is better than nothing.
Tarquin
*She returns your bow, though you can read the scepticism in her eyes.*
*She gives you a long look. Shakes her head. Turns away.*
Have you ever felt your own saliva sizzle? Have you ever felt your own brain pressing against the inside of your skull? I have. &lt;i&gt;I have felt it. &lt;/i&gt;That agony was the doing of the Divine. For his order to suffer the same fate &lt;i&gt;is not punishment enough.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you met her there. She survived but seemed traumatised. She ran off.*
*Say she doesn&apos;t sound happy to see you.*
&lt;i&gt;I know you.&lt;/i&gt; I figure who you are. The one we fear. The needle in the night. The Scion that is Scion killer.
What? &lt;i&gt;WHAT?!&lt;/i&gt; I am not some TREAT to be eaten!
By all means. Sheathe your weapons. Sway me with &lt;i&gt;reason. &lt;/i&gt;Why not lay out a picnic, while you&apos;re at it? We&apos;ll be best friends in no time.
Close Slot
Jahan will help Lohse after we do him a favour - go to a haunted island and kill &apos;the Advocate&apos;.
We fought skeletal undead in the marshes. Their old master died and left them to rot, but a mysterious new figure promises them a future.
Very valuable indeed!
I will await your return here, my love.
Avenge the log.
*The squirrel reaches out and touches your ankle, sending a hot flushing riddpling through your body. You mind&apos;s eye sees a new potential spell swirling before it.*&lt;br&gt;
Friendly Troll
Anything else ya want to chat about?
Electrified Water
T-thank you!
*Tell her she&apos;s making much over nothing. And you ought to keep moving.*
Day [1] - [2]:[3]
Transforms the Black Cat into a follower. Once rescued, a whistle will appear in your inventory. You can use this if your cat gets lost, or if you want to change who it follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
*Chirp chirp!*
We gave Mordus&apos; letter to Lohar.
Alas I&apos;ve already consumed the demons I had at my disposal so I could teach another Godwoken, but I&apos;ll not let you walk away empty-handed.
Logbook
And I am glad that you are here.
[LIZARD] *Glare at her and ask how a lizard came to be a pawn of Braccus Rex.*
*A rope of saliva and blood bungees from the creature&apos;s mouth to the ground below.*
*As you reach into the jar, the Source flows into you. The power is overwhelming, warming the cold spaces between your bones.*
Sir Pawel Alterion
Yes.
Permanent Finesse Potion
&apos;ey up, if it ain&apos;t the Beastman! Can&apos;t believe ya found Driftwood - how&apos;d ya smell the ale over all that rotten fish? Get it? Hahaha. Ahem.
I need more. I need your Source. I need your &lt;i&gt;life&apos;s blood&lt;/i&gt;.
Consider it a taste of your Divine future. The people will pray for you. In turn, they&apos;ll trust you to do right by them - as I&apos;m trusting you to do now. What I wouldn&apos;t give to watch, to study...
[IFAN] *Shrug. You&apos;re not all that surprised, to be honest.*
He&apos;s... gone! It doesn&apos;t hurt anymore. You did it. You saved me from the bad man. Thankyouthankyouthankyou!
Character is busy
*Without another word, Ifan turns on one heel and strides away, leaving the aggrieved dwarf spluttering in his wake.*
*Vampirise the spirit&apos;s Source before he can execute his attack.*
*Kiss her cheek. It is good to have your old cousin back.*
All this cowering rubs me the wrong way. Time for these cowards to die a coward&apos;s death!
Nightmarish Voidwoken
The very basics then. I suppose that&apos;s a start.
My brothers... My sisters...
*Remark that from the look of her, too much ferocity was had.*
For maximum damage, the wood is coiled and twisted in the Elven fashion.
Void Infused
&lt;i&gt;That &lt;/i&gt;not even I can do. Though I do wish you the utmost luck with that particular problem. You... will need it dearly.
Oh. That sounds more boring than I thought it would.
*Say that you&apos;ve no qualms about hurting him to get answers.*
I saw what it did to Lucian, a soldier like me. I won&apos;t let that happen to anyone else. For their sake... and the sake of Rivellon.
The chance that this character will successfully hit you with a basic attack.
Magical Light Metal Shoes
*Sadha is looking you right in the eyes and she seems none too pleased...*
Herbs and weeds, the gifts of Lucian. He makes me see and hear more. The gold-rays and the moon-hush.
one to bring back the trees,
It has been an honour.
Should the occasion arise to ascend again, I swear I won&apos;t let you down.
*Beast bows as far as his thick waist will allow him, and he is gone, called by the same howling seawinds that once brought you together.*
Summon becomes immune to Air damage and gains an additional Aerotheurge skill (depending on summon).
I&apos;m tired of chatting. Aren&apos;t you?
Nurse Re
Target gains Clear-Minded, which increases Strength, Finesse and Intelligence by [1] and Wits by [2]. Removes Blinded, Terrified, Charmed, Taunted, Sleeping, Enraged and Mad.
Mmm...&lt;i&gt;wrong!&lt;/i&gt; Not as clever as you thought, eh?
Moving to noxious atmosphere enabler!
But come. We&apos;ve travelled too long by one another&apos;s side to end with an argument.
The man&apos;s a... man, all too prone to the weaknesses of the heart. We&apos;ve seen the results of his errors firsthand. I give it a week before he errs anew.
After many adventures,
Just leave me with my contract and you&apos;ll never have to see me again.
Cock-a-doodle-doo
Leader in sight!
*He nods to the door, then takes the rigid stance of a proper royal guardsman.*
We managed to open the door leading into the inner chamber of the vault.
*The Paladin turns to her comrades.*
I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; her, just like I said. But the blessing I gave you: that was all me.
Day 25&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chains at least seem to be holding. There were some moments of concern, but the columns do their work. No soul shall escape this room.
See how Stewart&apos;s confrontation with Wyvlia went.
*Others? Ask what he means.*
Birds Jungle 01
I&apos;m very sorry but, once again, everything we have is on the shelves.
These are painful times; sometimes people must suffer for the greater good.
&apos;Here lies Victor Flynn.&lt;br&gt;A life&apos;s story cut short here.&apos;
