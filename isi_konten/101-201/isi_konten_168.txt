A hand, dear, if you&apos;d be so kind?
I killed the Shadow Prince.
A regional speciality known to make foreigners lose their faith in the gods.
Please. Release me...
...yes. I miss him. I miss us. No-one touched me so...
At last. From darkness a ray of light. Though far too late it shines.
You... ah yes, I remember your mighty beard from Driftwood.
Skin and bone tied together with dried entrails. As unpleasant to smell as it is to grasp.
Reclaim your mask.
Resurrected
But those are just dreams. No-one can escape from here.
What we &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;is a way to control the bloody thing.
*Absorbed in her repairs, the scientist sighs with exasperation as she hears your approach.*
I&apos;m stuck fast! Fate is an ice-cold mistress...
The talent Pet Pal allows you to speak to animals. Bark, bark. Moo.
*Tell her you do.*
You smell bad, &lt;i&gt;merc. &lt;/i&gt;But it&apos;s all yours. If you ask me the Sourcerer is already dead, but go ahead, you be my guest. First you&apos;ll have to put the fire out, at least enough to reach the cellar hatch.
But sorry... I imagine you&apos;re not here for soup! Welcome to Four Sisters! Would you like to take a look at our Sourcerous Sundries?
Mother, Father,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;m learning so much under the great Hannag! I can&apos;t say it has been easy. Hannag is... a &lt;i&gt;harsh&lt;/i&gt; mistress, and as you know, I can be prone to error. But where elemental sciences are concerned, nobody can compare to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope to be home in time to make the harvests plentiful for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All my love,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwydian
*Tell Kerban you are shocked to see him. What is he doing here?*
*Shake your head and reach for your weapon.*
Potion of Nimble Fingers
Be careful down there, mister. You&apos;re not smelling what I&apos;m smelling!
First meat I ate was a rabbit who died of boredom waiting for me in a race.
Crafty Weaponry: The Shiv
Yes... As long as that road eventually leads all the way back to my throne, that is.
*She flinches at the slightest rustle of wind through the long grass. Terror in her eyes, she stumbles away from you.*
*Ask about the Voidwoken. Whatever could have lured them here?*
Perhaps I&apos;ll have some fond memories of this day after all...
*The chest won&apos;t open.*
If you&apos;re looking for healing or the like, then you&apos;d best look elsewhere. My... my plate is full, for now.
Please... I can&apos;t be seen with you. Consorting with lizards in Arx is the same as throwing gold away these days.
You&apos;re on thin ice, fork-tongue. And I&apos;m very close to cracking.
My lord had faith - he came to me when Lohar failed the Queen.
Grab a bottle of air-oh.
Did you hear the one about the pregnant lich?
&lt;i&gt;Chamerou l&apos;aravel!&lt;/i&gt; The House of Shadows is everywhere!
Such a beautiful place, such beautiful folk. It makes me sad the children of today could never see it.
YOU! Oh, love, they&apos;ve been looking high and low for you.
Ha! Good one. Come on. Let&apos;s move.
*The man and the elf keep their voices to a discreet level, but it&apos;s impossible to miss the tension between them - they&apos;re arguing.*
Pillow
*All goes black the moment your hand reaches the ghostly Magister. You see nothing, hear nothing, for your senses are overwhelmed by the pain of razors slicing through your flesh.*
*She drapes her arms around your neck. Moves her face so it almost touches yours. She looks you in the eyes. Her lip twitches, as if ready to kiss...*
*Say that from the look of him, he has a belly full of &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; sour grapes indeed.*
*She turns to peer up at you, surprise and mistrust evident in her intelligent face.*
I didn&apos;t do nothing wrong, I swear!
*He looks at the corpses surrounding him. His wife lost to violence. Two of his children, slain as he watched. He tries to choke back tears, but soon they flow free, carving rivers through the grime on his face.*
Only an important person would carry such a prestigious item, and no-one important gets free from Fort Joy without help. The Seekers thought you were worth saving - thus you are Godwoken.
*Remind her she mentioned another &apos;chosen&apos;. Who did she mean?*
When the crackdowns and decrees came, I defended her. When she exiled you, I joined in the applause. But this new plan of hers... I want to believe, I do. But... Deathfog? Something&apos;s not right.
Our beloved princess is dead! What woe! What calamity!
*Chews* M&apos;names Paddy. I&apos;d ask yers but *swallows* it don&apos;t matter anyhow.
Back, eh?
*Remark that it looks... fleshier than usual. What gives?*
Countryside Indoors 03
You must enter the Temple, then *tttsssk* prove yourself in the Arena of the One.
Enter the Portal
Will you confront the Devourer and set me free?
Blacksmith Donalda
*She looks up at you weakly and smiles.*
Perhaps drawn by the Source in the ring, Voidwoken attacked.
We&apos;re &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;inmates! We&apos;re safer here than anywhere in Rivellon. With these collars on, no Source can flow from us, harming everyone. You should thank the Divine Order for that.
*You&apos;re in no mood to talk. You&apos;d rather fight.*
One night, I killed a scholar. With my needle through his fragile old skull, he fell head-first upon his writing desk, blood mingling with spilt ink.
Maybe you &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to remember. I... I prefer to keep looking forwards. The one contract I hold right now interests me more than any number I&apos;ve completed.
That I may finally pay for my sins.
*Sallow stares into your soul and shows his hand - you know that he has something that you seek, but will only share them with the one who leads your party.*
I&apos;ll do just that. Thanks.
*He pokes a finger against his ossified head.*
[SEBILLE] *As you stalk away, your elven eyes spot something strange on the barrels. Lean in to investigate.*
*Promise to find her the book if she tells the truth about why she wants it.*
Applies Chill and Chance of Frozen.
Crafty Weaponry: Wands and Staves
*The man&apos;s pointing finger shakes with both fright and giddiness.*
...so don&apos;t you pit your word against mine; you&apos;ll only lose. Now get out of my kitchen before I make you wish the Deathfog had taken you.
Squire&apos;s Pants
*WHACK! - the shopkeeper cuffs you about the head, shoves you away, and tells you to clear off. He calls you &apos;hag&apos;, and &apos;crone&apos;, and &apos;old witch&apos;, though you have only just reached maturity.*
*She looks at you straight on, hands on her hips, and squints.*
Smokescreen Arrow
Gravedigger
and united Rivellon in its battle against the Void.
Some say her plans for revenge will bring about the end of days.
[RED PRINCE] *Remind him a slaveling has but one use: to serve.*
This breastplate is made of finely-hammered metal. It would look imposing, except for the tiny dead yarrow flowers stuck to it.
Brutal warrior and expert in close combat
Well, I&apos;d love to show you, but I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t leave the bar unattended. &lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;crowd isn&apos;t to be trusted, believe you me!
[HERO] *Tell him that you believe in the innate goodness of the world.*
I don&apos;t know that it&apos;s fair. But it&apos;s what I&apos;ve got.
Nearby allies gain immunity to Slow effects and have increased physical resistance.
Cave for you.
Self-Made Sword
Inner Demon
It might stink, Quercus, but at least there are trees.
Challenge
Get away from me, I don&apos;t need some viper in my life. Who knows who else you&apos;re hissing to...
Figured as much. I thought I might meet you here. But the wedding&apos;s all yours. I&apos;m not leaving my dog or my driver here.
Dragon Breath
*Slowly back away from the creature, avoiding its bloodshot eyes.*
*Tell it you have no desire of participating in a power grab. Let someone else do it, for all you care.*
*Say you&apos;re glad she&apos;s a step closer to freedom.*
Assume Dragon Form
Or &lt;i&gt;master?&lt;/i&gt;
*Wallow in the accolades. You deserve them, after all.*
Gain an unreliable education in the rudiments of philosophy.
Have a good one! It sure feels good to know that you&apos;re here.
Um, um, &apos;scuse me... have you seen our ball?
Bluegill mushrooms often flourish close to water, where they can be seen bunched together conspiratorially.
What strange contraptions are these?
*Give Tarquin one of the parts and tell him to get to work.*
*Surprisingly, the elf musters a sober frown of indignation.*
Destroy [1] on target character, and set Acid status.
+[1] point = +1 Slot.
We spoke with the spirit of Alexandar. He told me that we should scour the island for the magic that will activate the lever that controls the entrance the Academy.
An explosive filled with nails that do [1] and may inflict bleeding to everyone in a [2] radius. Creates a small oil puddle with a [3] radius.
To pick locks, use a lockpick or the context menu of a door or container.&lt;br&gt;To pickpocket, interact with a character while sneaking.
[UNDEAD] *Remark that she doesn&apos;t seem like other elves. You can sense she has depth, secrets... just like you.*
*Three words that must suffice it seems. There is no further explanation forthcoming.*
*You&apos;re planning on taking a nice, long break. You want some peace.*
Alright, then. Stay safe out there.
*Ask the child if she isn&apos;t also a human.*
Paladin Sword
This collar prevents me from using Source magic.
&lt;i&gt;Adramahlihk.&lt;/i&gt;
Of course it&apos;s not true.
*You peer into the mirror and you see Sadha; the memory of sunset prophecy.*
*The spirit of the guard absently taps the pommel of his weapon as he continues his vigil.*
Your name we&apos;ll have! Your back we&apos;ll break!
Mudbarrow can&apos;t have his money. I hid it.
Gods, those flames! And Voidwoken, &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;. In our sanctuary, our&lt;i&gt; sanctuary!&lt;/i&gt;
*The girl&apos;s eyes don&apos;t even flicker as you lean in close.*
*Explain that she seemed pretty nice when you met her...*
Debuff Memory Potion
Though I did see one little girl, all by herself just beyond the harbour. Poor thing. She was too far off for me to help - she&apos;s surely dead by now. I hope it was swift, at least.
It will almost be a shame to destroy such an ancient relic.
Hmph. All I wanted was for you to help my friend.
Had you expected anything else, Red Prince? All your life you&apos;ve awaited something greater even than yourself. With her, you will have it!
Ahead? Heh. No. Not here. You won&apos;t - won&apos;t be able to - won&apos;t be...
*Tell her you are glad to have freed her.*
Spiderling
No! You must leave! You must not speak to it! You must not speak to the one who must be chained! It will steal your soul! It will steal your very soul!
Maybe we should fortify this place, make a stand...
*Tell her you&apos;ve already discovered that the Magisters were investigating the situation. They&apos;d found a hidden grating beneath the barracks that leads into the sewers.*
I merely long for a moment too long postponed. Come, you would never deny me.
*She holds the hand aloft and studies it with a satisfied smile...*
Dwarven Warrior
Plentity
This Malady is no mere elf - that much is clear. Some... &lt;i&gt;darker &lt;/i&gt;powers have made their way into her repertoire.
This is our time. If we wait, there may not be another.
*Brahmos must have fled into the dream realm. Urge the spirit to lead you to him.*
No, you have proven that you are capable. You fetched the Seeker back from the swamp, and I have faith you can overcome this challenge.
You there, sailor boy. A word!
Equality? Power shared among both the evil and the good. The light and the dark. The sky and the earth. Equal Sourcelight, yes. But not &lt;i&gt;equality.&lt;/i&gt;
Mommy! Mommy! Lookie lookie at &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;
