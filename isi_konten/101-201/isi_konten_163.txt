O&apos;en the chest. &apos;lease. &apos;lease o&apos;en the chest.
Stay clear. The loremaster must focus.
Oh good. That&apos;s for you then! Bye bye, flea scratcher-mabob!
*Demand that he tell you what he knows, or you&apos;ll use your Godwoken powers to consume his Source and cast him into nothingness.*
*Reach out to pet the wolf.*
Records revealed the possessed would speak with the voices of both victim and demon.
*Remark that you found something potentially suspicious: a letter from Linder Kemm, inviting Arhu to his Mansion.*
*It looks haggard and weak, its voice merely a feeble echo of your own.*
*Consume the Source within her.*
The truth can make you many friends. Me, for example.
*Gareth&apos;s fingers open and close around his sword&apos;s hilt. His breathing quickens. His forehead wrinkles. Yet his arm remains suspended in air.*
Tell yourself whatever you like - I won&apos;t be sharing with you either way!
*Any slight trace of tolerance towards your presence drains away in an instant.*
It&apos;s always &lt;i&gt;Sourcerers&lt;/i&gt;, they get into every nook and cranny and lure those Voidwoken out.
Doomsday Device
Peace mode DEACTIVATED!
Really? Hmm. There must be a shrine there.
Lucian was alive. It was he who conspired with Dallis to destroy the Seven, those power-hungry tyrants. He decided to banish Source from the world.
I&apos;ve been up and down the realm so often it&apos;d make your cabbage spin, and I&apos;ve picked up a few tricks along the way. Truth be told, I&apos;ve grown fond of crushin&apos; and castin&apos; - a Battlemage, if you like. But there&apos;s naught so important as team dynamics. So what&apos;ll it be?
*Ask what she&apos;s doing huddled over here in the corner.*
*Delorus lies dead at your feet. Perhaps he&apos;d still be alive, had he not felt the need to abandon you.*
[UNDEAD] *Emphatically tell the rat that it has no need to feel threatened - you have no use for food.*
...especially when the given food is highly unpalatable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the patient must be convinced to partake of the food, a sprinkling of Drudanae will transform the fare from ‘repulsive’ (in the mind of the patient) to highly savoury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[A looping hand has circled the word ‘repulsive’ and written &apos;Sourcerer&apos; beneath it.]
Elven Children
*A roguish little smile suddenly plays upon her lips.*
Matis
*It makes a face that says &apos;understand?!&apos;*
*OINK!*
Only what is whispered. Then again: I&apos;ve heard a lot of whispers. And I have heard of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, Sebille.
Every wickedness visited on my people, every evil that stalks this land - it was my fault.
You a hunter? I&apos;ve got just the thing.
*Frown and ask &apos;is it?&apos;*
Investigate the island.
Worn Key
Oh. That&apos;s too bad. Because thennnnn you could cheese-juice her uuuuup!
Your focus - your &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;focus - must be on finding these Masters. On finding the secrets to Divinity. Nothing else matters.
To thee I grant a tome of ancient and forbidden lore. A bounteous gift for a simple task.
*Ralvo&apos;s eyes linger on the table, where the card lies as innocent as a piece of cardboard can be. His gaze travels up your torso to meet your eyes.*
Too bad. I taught that boy right. Abstinence and chastity! That&apos;s what we learned in &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt;household.
More dead Magisters.
Oh, you do speak in riddles. All I know is cheese - and in this matter, I am expert!
*Clear your throat.*
Cave - Sunlit Chasm
Someone&apos;s left a prayer here - &apos;O Lucian, bless my sickly child...&apos;
I understand. But still... I hope that you may change your mind.
The Mother Tree asked Sebille to kill the Shadow Prince.
Until we meet again, Lohse.
*Inform Gareth you managed to find a wand that will see the Shriekers dead.*
*The cold presence ebbs away. You take a deep breath. The voice offers parting words...*
Disable Trading
When you really need to hammer a point home. Repeatedly.
Your sacrifice, my prince, is worthy of your rank - of any rank. Your people would make you emperor if they knew the truth. Alas... they can never know the truth.
*Ba-a-a!* Ungh, I&apos;m not suited for this! It&apos;s sea &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt;, not sea sheep!
*Gareth&apos;s face reddens, then pales. The following words are flat and distant.*
*Ask what he wants you to do.*
Weatherproof
Frame Cap Enabled
And wake...
*Take her hand and ask if &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt;&apos;ll be able to sleep tonight.*
*Shout in terror. It&apos;s worse than you thought. The whole thing&apos;s gonna blow! She needs to evacuate!*
Hmm - the painting&apos;s just a replica. Pretty nice, though!
We left Reaper’s Coast empty-handed.
Plain Ring
All I know is... you. When I look at you, I feel like everything is going to be okay. I feel like I&apos;m where I&apos;m meant to be.
Find the Scroll of Atonement.
*Advance upon the Voidwoken, weapon at the ready.*
Sallow says show them your steel! The God King demands blood!
Can&apos;t cast in this shape&lt;br&gt;
- let it be so and true.
Very well: in that case we&apos;ll forego the gallows and turn straight to the hunt! A predator has to prove its killer instinct after all.
*She eyes you warily.*
*Turn away. She&apos;s gone.*
Red Prince, eh? In that case you&apos;d better talk to Sir Hardwin. Centre bridge. Can&apos;t miss him.
*An unseen hand &lt;i&gt;yanks &lt;/i&gt;his head up by the hair. His wide, panicked eyes find his tormentor. His lips part to plead...*
Pardon you. I&apos;d like to speak with your leader.
Alright, then. I probably regret this, but... be on your way.
Aren&apos;t you enterprising. I&apos;ll let Waters tell you no herself.
[HUMAN] *Scowl that you don&apos;t even like eating shellfish, so you certainly won&apos;t stand to be insulted by one.*
*You are ready to depart, but voice concern - you won&apos;t turn against your comrades.*
Sturdy
*Ifan sighs and glances across at you ruefully. He opens and closes his mouth several times before speaking.*
&lt;i&gt;Today I not kiiiiiiiill you, snake-meat.&lt;/i&gt;
The Devourer is true divinity. He always listens, always guides. And I was his chosen preacher, a voice to the masses.
*He taps hammer to nail and doesn&apos;t look up.*
*You could have sworn she mentioned other people earlier. Who might they be?*
Nurrggh..
Not enough AP
Paradoxically, you can see better from the depths of this cowl.
Sight: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
[JESTER] *Bring the song to a crescendo with the immortal line &apos;the pie sits on your chair, the crust is leaking sauce, you&apos;re still quite fat&apos;.*
I can hardly bear to watch. Give her the Swornbreaker - give her peace.
My head and spirit stay here with my master. But my body lies at the halo of wildflowers, with the damnable one who took my life.
That&apos;s for me to know and you to never find out.
She might be dead, but she still managed to work a little magic on us.
Saheila speaks your name, Sebille Kaleran. Saheila names you the new Mother.
*The dreamer&apos;s eyes have rolled over white. His fingers twitch as you near... a &lt;i&gt;cold presence&lt;/i&gt; suddenly seizes you - your breath shortens, and a voice enters your mind, probing...*
*The velvet fabric easily tears, exposing her bare shoulders and breasts.*
You&apos;ve got quite the nerve. You&apos;re coming with me.
*Admit nothing. Humans are defined by their steadfastness and courage.*
*Despite the mask, you can feel her expression harden.*
But her story is not over. Not yet. Not while I know who harms her.
May I go?
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;COAL CLAW&lt;/b&gt;.*
Have you no understanding of the world? The God King is the &lt;i&gt;true &lt;/i&gt;king. The so-called Seven Gods betrayed him and cast him down. Now it&apos;s time for him to rise again.
Toxic Spit
Enjoy your stay, lassy.
You&apos;re under arrest! Time to lock you away before you get into more trouble.
*Ask why the Seven lords would have needed worshippers.*
*You burst into tears of relief. The Doctor has agreed to treat your ailments. He ushers you towards the inner chambers...*
Sourcerers. Evil. Controlling your Source. Saving Rivellon. Please - *cough* - please tell me at least some of this rings a bell.
UI Remove marker
We came across a blazing statue of unusual design. A marker for something, perhaps?
*Insist that you aren&apos;t making the story up, and demand he tell you about this &apos;promise&apos;.*
*Arhu&apos;s baffled look melts into one of understanding - and resignation.*
*Say you&apos;re in no mood for songs.*
Sparks fly with each step taken in these soft-soled slippers, as if the wearer were tinder to the flint of the earth.
I&apos;m Gareth. I lead the Seekers. We ready an attack on the Lady Vengeance, the Magisters&apos; vessel. Join us - the Divine wills it!
*Munch-munch.*
On your way here, did you... did you see my family, by chance? My aunt and uncle. My cousins. Little Henric...
No vessel ought to be laid low by those beasts. Not even one belonging to these red-robed jackanapes.
Get away from me, you swine.
Primitive Harpoon
Yes, the needle did find you rather tough to chew. Nothing it can&apos;t handle though, nor &lt;i&gt;finish&lt;/i&gt;...
I saw it. I saw it when they got her. I...
*Beasts? Does she mean Voidwoken?*

We spoke to him in haste, which seldom leads to any good.
the controller
Well - I would&apos;ve given you Griff&apos;s notes on ancient runes, but they&apos;ve apparently walked off. They were the only real thing of value I had left...
*Sniff.*
UI Map Left
Truly...? Then I owe you a debt. &lt;i&gt;Arx&lt;/i&gt; owes you a debt. Thank you, and farewell.
The forces of the King. They are everywhere. They are &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;.
Raider Swordsman
If a cell cannot hold you, then a grave will have to do!
I suspected the Seven lords won the war after they locked me here, but seeing their faces on dumb creatures? A depressing confirmation.
*Jonathan&apos;s spirit waits quietly and patiently for a release that may not come, and he may not deserve.*
You do not understand our rituals. You do not honour Sarias in the traditional way. But... perhaps there is something else you can do.
Tough but flexible, these vegetal boots will ensure solid footing on most any surface.
Trap Wits
Poisonous Turtle Hatchling
*Tell her that sounds like slavery.*
Ah. How very interesting.
*With that, Ifan embraces you fiercely. As your Source mingles together, you feel the memories of your night together caressing your body. The world can wait... just a little longer.*
Sure.
Must be getting closer to Lucian&apos;s crypt.
Dream Portal
Come out, come out, wherever you are...
Rarities, remnants, and relics! Buying and selling!
Go on in, sir. I need to close the gate behind you.
We gave Yarrow Migo&apos;s ring and told her he was dead. Migo was her father. Her fellow Magisters turned him into a Gheist.
[OUTLAW] *Rules don&apos;t bind you. That makes you very happy indeed.*
Run, Godwoken! Run!
*Tell her to think again. You&apos;ve cast Source spells before, and you&apos;ve taken Source in order to do so.*
Don&apos;t think you&apos;ve seen it all.
*You reach for the rib in question, but nothing feels different - not until you try to pull your finger away, and it remains glued to the bone.*
Whine all ya want. I&apos;m stayin&apos; and you&apos;re leavin&apos;, and that&apos;s that.
Braccus will cause untold damage when he breaks free of Dallis. I could have prevented that, if you had trusted me... but you didn&apos;t. Congratulations. Soon this will all be over - for everyone.
Never thought you&apos;d end up a prison guard, Vik.
Hey! You still wanna play, don&apos;t you? C&apos;mon: Ready...
Knight
[Translate51_d3fbf364-96e2-460e-92a8-bcb3c73c2b72]
*Ask why he&apos;s so excited about reaching Fort Joy. You haven&apos;t heard anything good about the place.*
The Divine held her ground, if barely. Desperate, the people pray for the rise of a new Godwoken once more.
