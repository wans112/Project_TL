But beware, such items are of limited power. If they cease to function, speak to me. I will be able to help.
Mother nature&apos;s most versatile fruit. Equally tasty raw, cooked, or smashed to bits and splashed on something else.
*Point out that he&apos;s still got a little brain on his shoe.*
Scouting Boots
I bet we can track down my old pack and ask some questions. Last I heard, they were camped out near Driftwood.
Sebille left the Nameless Isle without dealing with the Mother Tree.
Oh, you! Flattery won&apos;t get you a discount - but I&apos;ll give you another go, mister cheeky!
Laughing in the faces of my enemies, of course! Little do they know the most powerful Sourcerer the world has ever known scuttles on their very shores!
You must go to the elves that roam. A difficult journey - across the water and beyond. Tell them Saheila is here. They will send help. Please. She is important.
Yer money&apos;s hidden on the beach, Mudbarrow, by the water. *Yawn.* But you won&apos;t find it... &apos;cause yer dead.
A Collection of Notes
&lt;i&gt;Yow have yore orders! Get to it!&lt;/i&gt;
*You and Tovah draw fire that your friends may flee. You die in Tovah&apos;s arms.*
*Sniff and say that you support neither: both sides are as bad as each other.*
*Relent, for now.*
Are they... are they &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;gone?
Bah! Should have known better than to expect the right stuff from another Driftwood dwarf. Bunch of doormats the lot of them.
Armour of Frost Skillbook
How ironic. Here I am, trying to write about a god as &lt;i&gt;intelligent &lt;/i&gt;as Xantezza, while at the same time I&apos;m being pested by a dunderhead like you. Keep out of my light!
The gods can keep their powers for all the good it&apos;s done them. I&apos;ll keep my sword, for all the good it&apos;s done me. And I&apos;ll take &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;weapon too, if it&apos;s available. What do you say, can I count on your help?
Acid Spores

Oh well.
Cleaving Twohander
Arhu the wizard served the new Divine with honour, wisdom, and
And when the eggs hatch - when beautiful life bursts forth, give yourself to it. Lay down your head and rest. Your duty will be done.
*Ask why she has not already entered the city.*
*She gazes deeply into your eyes, uncomprehending. Then she &lt;i&gt;stares&lt;/i&gt;, and you feel yourself drawn into the mesmerising Source pools of her eyes.*
*Say you will truly make love to her, for truly you love her.*
*Tut and take your leave.*
I used to sell recipes in Driftwood. I can do that again. Anything you want, you get it for free. How&apos;s that?
I searched this island for a Dreamer: one of the mystics of our kind who - as you undoubtedly know - can travel the dream world at will, as if it were another realm just as real as our own.
Decaying Head
It&apos;s not a competition. It&apos;s my &lt;i&gt;job.&lt;/i&gt;
Retain that lesson, and I can triumph over undeath. The demon I hosted blackens another land now. It possesses the very doctor that liberated it.
Sister, no!
*Grunt.*
However, at least the citizens have &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; to save themselves. For that, you have my thanks.
*You stare at the luminescent stone embedded in her ring, and find yourself falling into it. You are floating on a current of pure Source, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colours.*
*The news hits you like a war hammer to the chest. Your people. Gone. It can&apos;t be...*
You should probably come to terms with the fact that you&apos;ve half a mind full stop! Rein in your impertinence will you? I&apos;m a fair man, but I won&apos;t spare the rod!
Let&apos;s not intimidate our guest further, Isbeil; I am yet too intrigued to give her leave. Why do you allow this woman before me?
Eternal Reflector
That conjurer laid waste to an entire temple in an &lt;i&gt;instant&lt;/i&gt;, after we bled ourselves dry trying to take it. Whatever reward that was coming to us is all for her now...
*Turn and quietly walk away.*
Enough dillydallying, shorty. You got my tea?
Magister Priestess
Food
The pointy things are everywhere! Watch out!
*Relent. Tell Ifan you&apos;d like to stick together. For now.*
Hatch with Intricate Lock
*You thought it would hurt more, but after all these years alone you find you don&apos;t need your people anymore.*
and dwarven technology became key in the battle against the God King -
*Give yourself to the goddess Amadia, your mother.*
Wreathed in sparking energy, this arrow can unleash a tempest upon its unlucky target.
*Say you first plan to rest. What comes next can wait.*
I&apos;m cursed, you know. Bloody Braccus bound me here to protect his vault. He has my soul in that jar just there, and I can&apos;t leave without it.
They&apos;re weapons that can... can kill with a screech. The Magisters patchwork them from l-living Sourcerers. Don&apos;t misunderstand me: we&apos;re &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; afraid to fight, but we&apos;re powerless against Shriekers.
*She darts over to the elf without responding. They begin talking in earnest, more quietly than you can overhear.*
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present to you: Lohse, melodist and muse.
By Duna&apos;s dagger, brother! You here to free us, or kill us?
*Ask if she could recharge your purging wand.*
*Ask why he wants to be the Divine of the darkness.*
The tree is surrounded, and the Advocate has us skipping stones.
Cupboard
Orders from the Guard Steward. IMPORTANT!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s come to my attention - again! - that several of you are bypassing the cargo hold security measures by sliding boxes onto the pressure plates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS WILL NOT DO. The purpose of these measures is to require the presence of at least three Magisters at a change of shift. Any deviation will result in at least one Magister getting thrown overboard. Make sure it isn&apos;t you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Magister Siwan
One of your party members is in a dialogue. You&apos;ll have to wait until they&apos;re finished to use a Waypoint.
*Ask why they came here after they left their homeland.*
The product of a very conscientious tooth-brusher, this tooth makes a fine trophy of war.
Magical Plate Gloves
Village - Beach Harbour
I want to be like you when I&apos;m big. A &lt;i&gt;singer!&lt;/i&gt; Why don&apos;t you sing down here?
Poison Gas Trap
*Ask for an original.*
*Nod to the crypt. Is that where you can find Anathema?*
I&apos;m not falling for that. Help! Criminal!
The key let me into the Fort. Freedom may lie beyond.
*The guard clenches his fists and cracks his neck in agitation.*
I am the only one who cares. &lt;i&gt;He &lt;/i&gt;will say otherwise - he always does. And in the end, he&apos;ll betray you.
*Thank her and say you are ready to return.*
*Say that you&apos;ll do what&apos;s necessary, and ask what comes after that.*
Is Lady K still cavorting with her... friends?
Ain&apos;t you an elf?
We agreed to help the Magisters against the Sourcerer.
*Say you&apos;ve come to collect Saheila.*
*Try to keep steady. You want to see more of this memory.*
The fate of this godsforsaken world now rested on their shoulders.
This is &lt;i&gt;strictly &lt;/i&gt;a Divine Order matter, reptile. Very, very strictly.
Frail Protector

Buttkicker
Keep your money, Sourcerer. All I want is to see you locked up in a cell.
Monsters
It is said to be a hollow place - stone and fire and filth. I go even so.
All that work. All that effort. Tossed into the gutter like a malformed child.
No, sir!
*Point your weapon at him. The dwarves need their queen, now more than ever.*
Searing Daggers
...to another! That&apos;s right, little prince. Your boo is betrothed to a very different kind of king...
Adramahlihk calls upon his limitless reserves of demonic essence to resurrect his Godwoken ally.
Start Action Points:
Poison Flame Grenade
You got that right, Hilga. You got that right.
*Hrrrmmmm*
*Play along with him. You&apos;ll pass this &apos;truth&apos; on to Dallis.*
Cleave Damage
*Shoot back an angry thought - he&apos;s mistaken, and he better get out of your head if he ever wants to wake up.*
Hmm. I suppose it does. Being on the winning side and all.
I should be careful. The last thing I need is unwanted attention.
She intrigues me greatly. I&apos;d say it was brave of her to send you after a demon hunter, but bravery implies something to be feared - she&apos;s fearless.
*He suddenly goes quite red in the face and his eyes flash with anger.*
Perhaps it may take us to the island.
The Alchemist
How about you don&apos;t go wandering where you&apos;re not wanted next time?
You make the wrong move.
I confronted them once I returned from the Hall of Echoes, and the pair of them tried to &lt;i&gt;kill me&lt;/i&gt;. They must be Black Ring agents, tasked with preventing me from ascending.
*Gasp! She has a room full of Kniles old things? Say she must be incredibly proud of housing such a trove in her tavern.*
Poisonous Trunk
I could&apos;ve sworn my helmet just jolted when I consumed Source just now.
Inner Dream Portal
*The spirit of a hulking armoured figure angrily thrashes at the surroundings with a ghostly warhammer - to no effect. Between swings, you glimpse his face - that of an orc.*
Poisoned Mug of Beer
Travel to Adramahlihk&apos;s home plane.
*Who you are is not her concern. You want to know who &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; is.*
Your spells will react with the environment, so use your surroundings to your advantage.
(Shush, Geraldine.) What&apos;s the bad news?
*Ahem* I don&apos;t believe you&apos;re here at &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt;behest, are you, darling? Do feel free to rest your feet elsewhere in the manor before being on your way. Ta-ta!
Ah, a wonderful question.
As I say, one last sacrifice is required. Yours.
Arx battled on.
I was speaking to myself! I&apos;ve never seen anything like these blighted fish before... I want to see what the Voidwoken have done to them.
*Stem the bleeding from your arm. Ask him what he&apos;s talking about.*
You would never forget Dorotya&apos;s kiss. Dorotya herself left Driftwood for the Ancient Empire, ever in search of the perfect kiss. She never found it - although once or twice she came close.

*Groan. You have more than enough potions - you want a percentage of the merchant&apos;s will.*
More recipe books for you then?
Majesty... Thou returnest from the night-time realm, laden with the promise of prophecy...
*Ask to see her wares.*
[SEBILLE] *Tell her your heart&apos;s not in this. It has been too cold for too long to stir passion.*
How can I help?
Serrated and notched along the hilt with all the kills it aided, this blade was clearly a trusty friend to one who can&apos;t have had many others.
Ifan! It&apos;s good to see you again. We need to get this ship moving, or else we&apos;re dead. Keep your eye out - who knows what&apos;ll help us.
Polymorph Skillbook
*You can guess at her emotional state by her nails. Tell her to step back. You&apos;ll handle this.*
Amadia&apos;s altar is at the highest point. Climb to the sky and you may find it. Shall you replace the lady? Or shall you take her to the Council?
*The pig begins to cry, in a blubbery way that only a pig can.*
What- no, I can&apos;t! I-
What? But- but- what about the dwarves? What about the innocents you&apos;re putting at risk?
[1]% chance to succeed.
I could not persuade Ifan to listen to Lucian. He turned against me and was killed.
(Mabel, he can hear us whispering!)
Spirit of Roost Anlon
*The knight bows his head and exhales. When he looks up once again, there&apos;s something different in his eyes... a passing flicker of lucidity.*
*Observe that there are two souls here; two souls, and they seem to be entwined somehow.*
