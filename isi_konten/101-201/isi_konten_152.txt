I might&apos;ve done the same to you, by the by. You certainly know your way around a fight.
*Say you&apos;ve seen Isbeil&apos;s treachery first hand - and you mean to stop her.*
He cannot hope to hold against the Magisters while their crucified weapons stand. And Amadia help the Seekers if they were to meet a Voidwoken...
You must move beyond understanding - into action.
Dwarven Guile
*Wonder how he hasn&apos;t made enough to retire yet.*
*You shake your head; death is at hand. You raise the dagger...*
The Loremaster&apos;s House
&apos;y friend, that would &apos;e &apos;rilliant. Whatcha want &apos;e to do?
*Or &lt;i&gt;&apos;Slay me&apos;?*&lt;/i&gt;
You will see... when you look me... in the eyes...
*Say hello, and ask who she is.*
*Stamp your feet in frustration.*
Find a way into the sewers.
It&apos;s not a very good dream, Susan.
*Agree. It&apos;s just alright.*
Ah, truly? Why our Shield is full of surprises, Quercus!
*Take your leave.*
They&apos;re clever, these Voidwoken. Always annoying when something that tries to kill you is intelligent.
He has cheated death. Thank you, stranger!
[MYSTIC] *Call out that only the gods are fit to take back what they have given.*
Knock it off.
So you did, you little firebrand, you.
Bless &apos;em, anyway. &apos;cept you-know-which.
Much good it does now that they&apos;re gone. Now. The store is open. Do your business, and be on your way.
I imagine it will shine even brighter once I tear out your lying tongue.
[ELF] *Nod vigorously. That sounds... beautiful.*
Big Sword
Not much more than what yeh&apos;ve been told, I&apos;m afraid.
Duration: 2 turns&lt;br&gt;Strength: [2]&lt;br&gt;Finesse: [3]&lt;br&gt;Intelligence: [4]&lt;br&gt;Constitution: [5]&lt;br&gt;Memory: [6]&lt;br&gt;Wits: [7]&lt;br&gt;Damage dealt depends on your weapon&apos;s damage rating.
*He steps forward and lowers his voice to a harsh whisper.*
[LIZARD] *He is a manifestastion of your subconscious fears. Resist!*
Let&apos;s go out with a bang...
I fell victim to the enemy of all great minds - fear.
That said, it doesn&apos;t feel right to be hawking wares with... that... next door. Job&apos;s a job though. Can hardly leave Arx with naught but empty pockets.
Natural? The gall, Quercus!
Oh, terribly sorry. For letting me live, you have my eternal ratitude. Hah. &lt;i&gt;Foolish stink-beast&lt;/i&gt;.
Nu-NAW! Peeper, it cannot be. He would never hurt &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt;. Except his own mother and all the other chickens in the CAW-coop. But that was an accident...
*He takes the news calmly. A moment passes as he calculates the consequences, assessing this new world as it opens up before him. He nods his thanks, then turns to his comrades.*
*Ask him how the hell you&apos;re to get out of Fort Joy to meet this person.*
*Quickly slice through her restraints and help her down*
[1] enables you to talk to animals.
*The priest&apos;s jaws might be sewn shut with fishing wire, so harshly do they clench at the sight of you. He speaks one clipped, precise syllable.*
You only have to ask. Just don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest.
This crossbow attacks over and over, like the frenetic claws and teeth of a wild animal.
You were decent in the arena, but you&apos;ll have to do better than that to be named the One.
Imagine having the gall to want a hundred generations gazing at your own face.
Dead Chicken
*Tell her you have bad news about Gareth; he died in an incident on the mainland.*
|Wild Mag|
We found an ancient temple of sorts, deep in the caverns of the Blackpits.
How right you are. I am a loyal servant of the God King. And he demands your death.
*Anonymous in a busy city square full of hollering crowds and overpowering scents.*
Unusual Artefact
*Ask where their leader is now.*
*Turn and leave her to her grief.*
My husband may tell me little of his work and keep his secrets locked in the attic, but he&apos;s an &lt;i&gt;important man!&lt;/i&gt; Discretion is paramount for someone in such a high position.
Assassinate Pigsbane the Lone Wolf.
Dallis and Alexandar offer a solution. People &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;solutions at a time like this. No matter the consequences. Some people, anyway.
*Grill the Magister for more information about this Sourcerer on the loose.*
To the Sewers
One or more Adventurers were unwilling or unable to Venture Forth.
I...
*Tell her she&apos;s a patronising bitch.*
The elves allowed us in.

Listen up: I need your help. We all do. Mordus has his hands on something dangerous. Something I was trying to &lt;i&gt;protect &lt;/i&gt;us from. Not just my folks - the whole damn realm.
May the land sustain you and the wild game feed you, friend.
*You swallow all you can, and despite the meat in your stomach, you feel a new space inside you. A potential waiting to be filled.*
Bastard Sword
*A rage builds within. You&apos;ve had enough of his condescension. Bury your needle in his impertinent heart!*
*Hrm* *Hrm* *Hrmph*
But before you begin, a word of warning. I gather that you travel with a pack of these lesser creatures?
*Shudder as you remember Borris, the Magister at the prison gate. Hide the memory from the lizard spirit.*
*Ghostly flame whips around you, pushing in on all sides, but you have fought the dragon before. You won&apos;t bow now.*
*Sebille twirls her ghostly needle, her face set in a defiant scowl.*
Seek and You Shall Find
My first question: &lt;i&gt;Are you hungry?&lt;/i&gt; Actually, that&apos;s not quite what I mean. But you eat flesh. When you look at me, what do you see? A dwarf? A bard? &lt;i&gt;A meal?&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for something with a little more... juice.*
Soon, the prince became the Dragon Emperor.
I... *cough*... I see... a light... turn it off or I&apos;ll *groan* cut yeh!
No-one tells me there are so many &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt; in this Fort Joy. Magisters I handle, but small ones... Well. Not your kind of small. You understand.
*Her eyes glisten and her distended abdomen jiggles and shakes. Is she... laughing at you?*
*Very well, if none shall pass, you&apos;ll take your leave and head back.*
I see plenty of liars in my line of work. Snakes, weasels, worms. That fella&apos;s square as a pavestone. If he&apos;s the thief, I&apos;ll eat my boots.
*Ask him about Braccus Rex&apos;s tricks. What evils was he performing here?*
*Gareth moves to continue his task, but his cadence falters. He pauses. Silence hangs, begging to be broken.*
*He approaches her, goes down on one knee and courteously kisses her hand.*
*You lift up the Deathfog and, fighting against every step, you walk back to the cart. You pass a dwarf, struggling against the voice and winning, but you crack his skull with the barrel in your hands.*
*The dwarf is unnaturally still. You might mistake her for a corpse, were it not for a slight twitch of her eyelids.*
We elevated him, presented him to the Order. &apos;Here he is,&apos; we cried. &apos;A claimant to Divinity!&apos; Lucian&apos;s cathedral wouldn&apos;t remain empty for long. We were certain of it.

But of course she is the mother already now that we have lain together. I must find her! I must know she and my children will be safe!
Yes... If you sprout hair as copiously on other regions of your physique, I don&apos;t doubt you&apos;re well versed in the secrets of grooming.
I&apos;m watchin&apos; you.

Used to be a sorta demonologist. Was learning the arts, at least. Never did have much of a knack for it, t&apos;be honest.
To atone for my sins I spent the rest of my days taking care of the sick and elderly,

Ifan&apos;s Theme Light Intro
Ha! Words, mere words! My claws can clip iron shackles as easily as the hair on your pretty head! But what can those five-fingered paws do? NOTHING!
*Interrupt her.*
Thank you.
[1] got a lucky find!
[JESTER] *The last thing you remember is hoisting your fifteenth pint. Is this the Ram&apos;s Head loo?*
I... I just can&apos;t put the interests of one individual above the fate of all Rivellon.
Nnngh. How could I have been so... simple, when the truth is so &lt;i&gt;vast?&lt;/i&gt;
Explosive
Someone may have been killed in the Forbidden Library.
Incarnate learns how to go invisible and strike foes with a corrosive slash. Increases damage by [1]%.

*Demand a refund.*
That&apos;s all you aWKAWKAWKdventurers care about, no? Get your flapping out of my beak!

*Tell him he has quite a flair for insults.*
Fossil Strike
Huh - a reproduction, and a fine one, of the Second Passion.
*Tell him you are the last of the Godwoken. All the others are dead or far away.*
*He sighs happily as he no doubt recalls some of the more pleasurable details of your time together.*
Skull Pile

Lucky ain&apos;t the word I&apos;d use. Nor&apos;s patient, so go and loom somewhere else, elf. I&apos;ve got enough to do without picking your leaves off the catch.
[HERO] *Tell the statue that whatever you may have done, you refuse to feel ashamed.*
[The first part of this letter is obscured by smears of bloody viscera.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... I trust you will take the tenderest care of them for me. Once you have, bring their bodies back for my collection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am sure I can find some use for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D.
You would do this? You would allow me to be finally free?
&lt;i&gt;Stay out of my way.&lt;/i&gt;
We convinced Sister Schori to leave the schoolhouse.

*He takes the head in his hands and gazes into its lifeless eyes. He tenderly strokes Garvan&apos;s head and a sad smile crosses his lips.*
[VILLAIN] *Tell him you believe the world is innately evil... and so are you.*
I do not believe I have been drawn anywhere. It is a quaint little read, but it has its faults.
*Shrug. Leave him to it.*
Lohar? Sorry - not familiar. I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ve mistaken me for someone else. Now, I&apos;m sure you&apos;re a busy lass, so you should... be somewhere else.
*Ask about the armour that he&apos;s tinkering with - something he took from the Magisters?*
