*Ask if he really did collude with the Black Ring.*
Gee, you don&apos;t sound like a Master. You&apos;re nicer than the others. But I still miss my Ma and Pa.
*Ask who the &apos;top brass&apos; consists of.*
You&apos;re the champ, ain&apos;t you? You could well be the One...
Naivety. Stupidity. Call it what you want. I wished to put the Source within me to good use, and demonology seemed as good a use as any. Silly me.
Bone Crawler
Slane
Why did he do it...?
Indeed. So, you&apos;ll be wanting more then?
Murga, champion of Driftwood, died outside the arena. The champion&apos;s throne is vacant.
*The Magister ignores you and continues to chant.*
They say cats have nine lives. Trrruth is, we have many morrrrre than that.
*The groom looks you over with a sneer and mutters:*
*Shrug; you can&apos;t be sure. Why?*
We convinced the talking door to let us through to the captain&apos;s quarters.
|Can not be cast by Sourcerers|&lt;br&gt;
*Looking at him, you are struck by the ease with which he lives in his body. His long, lean frame is relaxed, but his hands fidget, dextrously twirling a coin between each finger. He hums gently to himself.*
You again. And who exactly might you be?
You ready to dance? Then cue the music!
*Tell her to calm down.*
We confirmed that the voice talking to us in the burning visions is the Devourer himself. He promised us great power if we ally with him.
Lesser Poison Ooze
The chill of the Hall of Echoes clung to the Lady Vengeance
Cup of Oil
We will be the scorching lightning, the searing pain forever!
Normally we&apos;d take her down and ship her off to the necklace farm - but she doesn&apos;t seem the type to go quiet. And the White Magisters aren&apos;t too happy with her. If we don&apos;t kill her they probably will.
Buttons... the undead cat from Bloodmoon Island! The little girl&apos;s name must be Iris.
*Shrug. You never took a spirit who didn&apos;t deserve it.*
Many of your kind have been felled of late. I fear you may be my - &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt;- last hope. I would not see you lost to me.
*And there, beneath the regret, lies the kernel of fear from which all of this rage flowed. Fear that he could not be better. Fear that what he was was all that he could be. Fear of his own potential greatness.*
*About the queen...*
Military Axe
That will not be necessary, Godwoken *kssrrrkssst* I am here to serve!
*Affect Lyn&apos;s breezy charm - call the Sourcerer &apos;love&apos;, tell her Lyn would be disappointed if she knew Hannag was turning you away.*
Jeth
Tell me. What have you done in order to make it this far? How have you failed?
*The spirit looks to you, confused.*
*Tell him you&apos;re Godwoken, born to be Divine,&lt;i&gt; and he can go to hell.*&lt;/i&gt;
I had rather hoped that your people would be less crude than the other races I have observed, but no.
Reactive Armour Scroll
*She stares off into the distance at some unseen horizon, ignoring you completely.*
What a pleasant little nest.
Eternal Conductor
Redemption

Oh Charlie. I hope you were good while I was away?
Potion of Power
Available Ability Points:
I&apos;ll die and be reborn! I&apos;m lifting the Veil, O King! I swear myself to you!
[BEAST] *Tell the lass to calm herself: you&apos;d never hurt her. Ask her what happened.*
Ha! You&apos;ll pay for trying such an old trick on me!
I cannot, not from this world that is no world; the home of spirits and dead memory.
Pay up, cuckoo.
*Your demon is back.*
*Yell at the chest and give it a solid kick.*
Death or victory... the fates will decide.
My contract is confidential. Its secrets will not pass your lips from this day forth.
Nothing. Huh. You just have one of those faces, I guess?
You and I, we know each other like only true lovers do, so at long last let us become lovers.
I knew they had done &lt;i&gt;something &lt;/i&gt;horrible to me - the Magisters - I just didn&apos;t know what... they arrested me in Arx and put something in my head... something &lt;i&gt;alive.&lt;/i&gt;
*Looking down at his mangled corpse at your feet, you see that the front is relatively unmarked, but his back has been eviscerated. Long, jagged cuts run the length of his torso.*
*Now that you&apos;re out, ask Han why he was in Fort Joy in the first place.*
I swear, I couldn&apos;t help it! Kemm all smelled like when the garden-man cuts down a decayed tree, like... like he was using flowers to hide the rot. A little like you, but a little not like you, too.
The Maid
*The servant grunts and motions you away.*
Armor Sets mod name
Meistr&apos;s House - Cellar
Magister&apos;s Breastplate
[DWARF] *Sigh and state that only humans are capable of such cruelty.*
Finding Lord Arhu
Elves have... different palates. We are simple folk, you must understand. Consuming flesh has sacred meaning to us - many avoid consuming it for mere sustenance.
&lt;b&gt;Her name is lost. All that defines her will be lost. We will see to that.&lt;/b&gt;
Stop! Stop! I can&apos;t see, I can&apos;t see! Please!
The great city of Arx was spared further conflict.
From a series of &apos;easy to memorise nursery rhymes&apos; comes this pearl:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fly agaric, white and red&lt;br&gt;Should you eat it, you&apos;ll drop dead&lt;br&gt;Mix it, brew it, in potions distill -&lt;br&gt;Then coat your weapon: kill, kill, kill!
I fled when two others entered. A woman in white, and a hooded man. I did not see what became of them. Dead in the bad place, most likely.
Looks like the fighting is over for today. The One draws nearer.
The captain&apos;s boots are ours. They&apos;re made of well-tooled leather.
*As your hand nears the ghost your skin begins to itch... but more than that, your world expands - your vision narrows and fades, and your perception of the cavern is enhanced. Your nerves hum as if stretched taut...*
Harrwwuurgh.
We can fight the Devourer together. I can walk the path to his dream, so you may confront him and free us all.
Spirit of a Crushed Elf
You&apos;ve got a talent for destruction. So I&apos;d like to show you a talent of my own...
I see a spark in you  - the beginnings of a fire that may blaze our path back to pre-eminence in Rivellon. This is why I have chosen &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;to lead humankind back toward divinity.
The Magisters have been under pressure from Dallis to pick up the pace of their activities in the caverns.
Patty Cake, Patty Cake, Volume II
We killed the chick. The rooster gave us a reward.
*Say that Alexandar made it to the Nameless Isle, but he must have perished along the way.*
You are kind to offer, but you&apos;d best talk to Gareth&apos;s squire Exter - &lt;i&gt;he&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; know where your talents can most be used.
Pliant protection that bends and bolsters in equal measure.
I&apos;m busy watching for clues, Sourcerer. Go take your sob story somewhere else.
I&apos;m inspecting your teeth - in case that wasn&apos;t spectacularly obvious.
*Ask the pig what she&apos;s up to.*
I know it&apos;s the same ol&apos; sea breeze I&apos;ve always smelled. But it&apos;s different now. I don&apos;t know how to explain. Maybe you do.
You? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are not the one who promised me dinner. But I hunger... you will fulfill your companion&apos;s promise or you will be dinner yourself.
Pay up, elf. No-one shorts Griff, &apos;specially not one of &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
*The automaton remains still on the floor, weak light pulsing from its core.*
Your kind may be older than ours, but I don&apos;t think even the elves will outlast the Void. We are unprotected, you know. We are all alone...
You may need to visit several of them - I doubt any one would be willing to give up &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of their secrets.
There&apos;s nothing wrong with death, my friend. Nothing wrong at all.
Custom Stats
*Tell him not to touch your companions or he&apos;ll regret it.*
Curse target character or surface.
Find a Purging Wand for Gratiana.
I would sooner implore Duna to intervene than to leave behind a trail of crimson limbs for the innocent to clean away.
I must check on the Chancellor...
Shoo, ya fleabag! Shoo!
*When you touch the glass, your vision wavers.*
*The fellow cocks his ear, listening.*
Hey. What&apos;s that thing?
Black wax. This was one of Adramahlihk&apos;s.
Spirit of Magister Idris
*The captain yanks his sword fully clear of its scabbard and levels it at you.*
I thought Voidwoken were supposed to be scary.
Together, we can do anything. Everything.
Loyalty deserves a better end than that lad got. This is on us.
Wind Cave 02
[MYSTIC] *Tell him he speaks true. You commune with spirits of aeons past.*
Mercenaries... you ought to think beyond the gold that&apos;s coming to you - the God King is the &lt;i&gt;true &lt;/i&gt;king. The so-called Seven Gods betrayed him and cast him down. Now it&apos;s time for him to rise again.
Get away from me, wench.
Constitution determines how much Vitality you have.
Unchain
Well, pardon me if I don&apos;t put too much stock in your &lt;i&gt;feelings &lt;/i&gt;- Knowledge. Facts. Discerning, educated opinions. &lt;i&gt;That&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;what I put my faith in.
I&apos;ll tell you if you can keep it quiet long enough for me to listen!
*Place a hand under what&apos;s left of her dress and move it up along her inner thigh.*
Character Creation
This is not the work of fate. It is the work of the Void.
*Hesitate - something&apos;s not quite right...*
*Sashay over to her. Undo the clasp on her robe.*
Very well: in that case we&apos;ll forego the gallows and turn straight to the hunt! A would-be Magister has to prove her killer instinct after all.
Well, I take what&apos;s mine. But I&apos;m not letting you get away with this!
People are messy, and so&apos;s life. Nothing to be done about it, and no point judging.
*Tell her not to make a big deal about nothing. This thing, whatever it is, isn&apos;t going to get the best of you.*
Almira and Mihaly settled in an abandoned homestead. The locals liked and respected Almira - she never wanted for help, and deals always fell to her favour. Outsiders were often suspicious, but no local would speak against her.
What else do you hide, thief? Speak!
You unnerstand. How, y&apos;know. Sometimes. You just wanna be fine.
*Stick your hand through the bars of his cage and offer your palm.*
*The lizard sits, tending her wounds as you approach. She seems to have been beaten rather badly.*
*His lascivious eyes flick over you to skin-crawling effect.*
Business savvy? Don&apos;t be profane! This is people&apos;s health we&apos;re talking about! And I get by just fine in the meantime, thank you kindly.
What are you trying to hear, anyway?
*MOO!* Yesss, yesss, BURN!
Water as a Weapon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Huwbert quickly outlines the ways in which a Sourcerer of a certain bent may turn even the gentle rain to their advantage. From razor-sharp ice to frosted armour through to strange powers of healing, Cranley seems willing to acknowledge that a good hydrosophist was, at one point in time, of great value. Now, he seems to paint a rather darker picture.*
But then... well I&apos;m sure you saw for yourself - the landscape tore itself open, Voidwoken appeared, and a shroud of decay fell over us. It&apos;s preventing Mihaly&apos;s wounds from healing.
*Say you&apos;ll do what you can.*
No, you &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;me. So - I teach you and you spare me. Do we have an accord?
*You feel the bond break between your finger and the skeleton; you pull your hand quickly back to your side.*
[DWARF] *Muster a noble affect and tell her the Queen herself has ordered your entry.*
