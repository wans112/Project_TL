*Cock your head and ask what she meant about the island.*
But &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; his son. I can be trusted to the end. And I will take any actions necessary, for the good of all. Nothing can stop me... not even death!
*Tell them you&apos;ve changed your mind. You&apos;ll go back for the others.*
*Dot sniffs at the collar. Recognises it as his own. His ears fold and his head drops. A hangdog expression appears upon his face.*
*Ask how - what does linking to the Ancestor Trees involve?*
How much damage this item can take.
*Tell her she doesn&apos;t look too bad herself.*
*Your God thrashes and recoils inside you. Your long-stilled heart suddenly &lt;i&gt;somersaults &lt;/i&gt;and a lone word hissed in your inner ear -&lt;i&gt; &apos;Void&apos;.*&lt;/i&gt;
My offers still stands, if you think you&apos;re up to the challenge...
S...sure! First: Always... win. Second: Never... lose. What are ya, some kinda... kinda... idiot?
Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more. There is wrath. There is greed. There is violence. The sentence is more. Burning blood broils and boils you. What is the sin?
I know, darling Fane. I have seen you move through this barbaric world. I have seen your struggles. But they are nothing compared to what would befall us all if you turn from this path.
Solid Sabatons
...my child. Face me.
*Say that you haven&apos;t charged it yet.*
Oh, I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; sorry. Who are you again? Oh, right: Someone who needs to mind his own business.
Seven save me! This leaf is strong!
Daggers Projectile
Chef Wyvlia&apos;s Hitlist
Ol&apos; Zillik much prefers loungin&apos; in the hole than chasin&apos; demons hither and thither, I&apos;ll tell you now! Not in any hurry to get back to the hunt.
*Ask the bear where the bees are gone.*
*Urge her to tell you the truth: is she dying?*
*...a towering oak withstanding gale-force winds.*
*With a rancid look, the dwarf pockets the knife. As he does so, you see an elaborate seal on the handle. Through gritted teeth, the dwarf growls...*
I see it in your shoulders. The weight you carry. I hope your wish comes true.
*Nod, you&apos;re pretty bad. Elves can be merciless, and are especially bloody now that their homelands have been destroyed.*
*Ask about this strange, vivid place. Was it real once? Memories of a battle past?*
*Tell Ifan it&apos;s time to leave, while the leaving&apos;s good.*
*She slumps back in her chair, the energy draining from her face.*
The main ingredient of a Rivellon-famous fish pie.
*Say it&apos;s nothing. Another passing visitor, one of many.*
You&apos;re telling me. Jump in the boat and I&apos;ll take the oars...
Ah, my sister in savagery has returned!
You brought him back from the brink. Thank you!
Find a way into Lucian&apos;s tomb.
*A half-smile passes over his lips. He reaches out and holds your arm. You wait for a response, but he doesn&apos;t seem to notice your lack of flesh.*
A fitting tribute to a worthless god, if a god I am still.
Anyway. Did you buy some of our Sourcerous Sundries from her?
Elven Scion
And suddenly you&apos;re an authority on the subject? You&apos;ll have to forgive me, but as far as I can tell, you&apos;re just stumblin&apos; along too. So spare me the lecture.
Magical Concentration
*Say you&apos;re coming from the Dwarven Kingdom.*
There&apos;s also the matter of my payment for all the stuff I&apos;ve done for you. That&apos;ll be...
*His eyes flutter shut, and he assumes his position of repose once more.*
*Wonder what he&apos;s trying to achieve by casting such powerful magic.*
* - and with a cry of horror he is gone.*
*The ghostly seaman rings his bell, his hate directed at his captain. He turns to you...*
And when they get there, the air will turn to screams. Dying, choking screams...
*Say that you heard something else - that Mihaly is being protected by that witch, not held hostage.*
Nevertheless, one good turn does deserve another, so as far as the whole slave business is concerned, let&apos;s just forget about it. You may as well have your freedom!
A list of the damned. Perhaps their loved ones will be inspired to seek revenge.
*Gareth holds his hands up to his face. Dirt clings to the underside of his nails. Grooves on his palms remain from his agitated digging. The self-inflicted wound on his finger is encrusted with blood.*
*The rat gives you a mischievous look... holds it for a long moment, then...*
Burned alive? Sounds hot.
*The door remains closed. It seems you need more than a password to open it.*
This was Lucian&apos;s altar. Defile it. Shame it. &lt;i&gt;Curse &lt;/i&gt;it.
Who can tell what happened when the stars above this paradise darkened in the Void, and froze even the fire of dragons?
Best to keep this one stowed deeply. Rivellonian tavern myths oft return to the tragic story of poor Elgrid, whose demise was certain the day he accidently sat on a quiver of these.
Find the workshop where the craftmistress flourished. I will draw strength from there to speak again.
Thinkin&apos; he needs t&apos; change things up. Gettin&apos; tired of hearin&apos; &apos;bout those damned elves.
Yes. It is as though Tir-Cendelius himself forgets us. There is no fate for us but the one we make.
Sebille...
You would kill the only man who might aid you? I was hoping you were a reasonable man, Beast. You might have left the Isle of Mists, but you&apos;re still suffering from its madness.
*The human undead leans in, studying you suspiciously.*
*Inside you, Amadia rumbles in protest.*
Hi. Bye.
Well, that was fun.
That is how I wander this strange world, trying to uncover the truth about a history you primitive people never even knew existed.
Although perhaps it is good that you know. Your &lt;i&gt;pet &lt;/i&gt;has seen Consul Zara&apos;s chest, thrown to the graveyard&apos;s eternal flame by the creature that owns this house.
*Say you&apos;re still not sure you understand it completely.*
*Say it seems the Divine Order are even worse than your already rock-bottom opinion of them.*
The Nameless Isle
It&apos;s our Sourcerous Sundries, of course! Our little miracles can sharpen weapons, harden armour and brighten jewellery - truly &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; products for those in-the-know.
Mmm, who knows? A nice cottage someplace quiet for Mihaly and I? A roaring fire and a feather bed? Maybe, maybe...
Quiescent Pair
The air is charged with danger. What could it be...?
She&apos;s not. Well, not in the strictest sense. She&apos;s not exactly an &lt;i&gt;elf&lt;/i&gt;, either. Half demon, Meistr Siva says, and I don&apos;t doubt it.
To my astonishment, and - I admit - my admiration.
Dead! Just like that. Can you believe it?
Give some gold to the Character
[1] allows you to control an extra summon.
Starting turn...
We must hurry now! We must race toward the well with all the determination of the eagle diving for its prey.
Mask of the Magus
*Rather than face the truth, his mind shuts down and his life flashes before his eyes - and yours. Lucian taking his life. His search for the capacitors. His journey to the mountain. His mother who loved him so - *
I see the good in you, Sebille Kaleran. Saheila sees the all of you. You are the new Mother. For the elves, you are the one last hope.
Minimum Karma
Wind &amp; Insect Forest 01
*...she&apos;s next.*
Cat&apos;s Treasure
I say! It &lt;i&gt;is!&lt;/i&gt;
Gwydian Rince
*Say that you&apos;d quite to like see the world.*
Justinia listened to Alexandar intently. I&apos;d always thought of dwarves as... pragmatic. I presumed she would ally with him. But she proved disloyal. The dwarves would not be part of his plan.
Demon Nightsinger
*Frown. That beast is her father?*
*The kid screams like a banshee and runs away as fast as he can.*
Bock bock bock...
Wait!
And after that - families. Caravans. Whole villages. A land filled not with living dead, but with the forsaken living.
Poison Potion
In life, I knew Duna&apos;s Knight well. He would hate to be like this. Believe me, you would be releasing him from torment. Please do so.
[1] charges left
Summon Fire Slug Scroll
I have to stop these disappearances. My career is at stake!
A prison? I don&apos;t want to know what happened to the prisoners...
*It doesn&apos;t work.*
Show Inactive Quests
Why do I get the feeling we&apos;ll be on the other side of it in a moment...?
For. The. Rest. May. He. Have. Mercy. On. Your. Soul.
You&apos;re dangerous. You hear? I need to protect people. I need to protect &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
As you wish. You have a good heart, my friend. Better that than one which rots, but yours... I fear it is &lt;i&gt;too &lt;/i&gt;good. I leave you with my thanks.
*As Sadha takes the scythe, a black tendril becomes visible, rising from her heart into infinity. With a decisive cut she slices it through. A hiss, and it evaporates. She&apos;s free. She&apos;s sworn no longer.*
War Bonnet
Bird Nest
*Strike an arrogant pose. If they think Braccus was bad, they should see &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;curses...*
Potent Alertness Herbmix
The High Priest&apos;s hymn grants entry to the vaults.
Character is charmed and has switched sides.
*Scoff and say you don&apos;t buy heartfelt concern from a slaver.*
All I seek right now is a way out of here.
Wooden Wand
I have to be honest, I don&apos;t understand the half of it. All this new-fangled stuff. Back in my day we were content with a sword and a bedroll!
*Wink* Something to remember me by, darling.
*Take his hand and shake it. This is goodbye.*
Random
Then I can&apos;t let you in. We failed her when we locked her in this place. I want to see that put right. If you won&apos;t help, then I&apos;ve nothing more to say.
*Wonder why Lovrik would lie to you.*
*Up on the ledge before you a lone lizard woman overlooks the marshes. Her stare is as sharp as the bolt eyeing you from atop her crossbow.*
*Shrug. You travel alone for now, but if they seem useful you may join with others.*
Whatever is driving them will soon feel the pierce of my needle.
A Sourcerer. He arrived dressed as a tinkerer, but then Magisters started disappearing.
Oh goody!
A likely story, but I see right through your lies. Die, killer!
Listen. When I was wee, one of Lora&apos;s manservants used to tell an old lizard tale.
Get a few bruises on your face and then we&apos;ll talk.
*You look on as Sebille bares her arm and drags her needle across the word &lt;i&gt;Master&lt;/i&gt; like a knife, drowning the black ink in blood.*
Who are we?
*Beast grumbles.*
He&apos;s really dead, then. Thank the gods. You don&apos;t know what world of good you&apos;ve done.
Let the game detect the best quality settings for you.
*Ask him to tell you more.*
I was somewhere else... for a while. Just... back off. It&apos;s nothing I need to talk about. But there&apos;s something... new within me.
I&apos;m well aware of what you couldn&apos;t do.
Light Helmet
Not with that collar on, you aren&apos;t.
Bottle of Water
*The object repeats its cryptic remarks.*
I know that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; for one can scare a demon. And I speak from experience.
You, Ifan ben-Mezd, the Silver Claw, the Redeemed Divine. What did you do with your power? What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
There are too few of us. You well know our kind finds value in flesh, where memory lingers. I collect memories, yes - but am more keen on bark and leaf. On the living breeze, not the sleeping past.
In a manner of speaking. But let that be a motivator, not a cause for concern.
...I am sorry, Fane. Truly. I would have embraced you.
The God King never forgot my failure.
