*His heart races where your hands press down on his chest, and you can feel him growing - not just where you&apos;d expect, but &lt;i&gt;everywhere.*&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm, a lofty take on yourself, no? I suppose time will take measure of your actions...
Citizen Breifne
Only his death can set me free...
*Ask how she escaped from Fort Joy.*
Be glad, kin. The Mother Tree is gone. You are free. Saheila says we are all free.
Quit idlin&apos;! We have to dig.
*She sits up on her knees, still straddling your hips and shimmies out of every last article of clothing.*
You know! You know, how when... you&apos;re just not... not right! You know, on a person basis.
Bear Cub
See here, elf.

Oh hi! You again! Everything okay? I&apos;m much better. I like it here. &apos;part from the smell. But you know, the only thing worse than a bad smell is no smell at all.
To examine a character, hover over them and hit [IE_ToggleInfo]. The higher your Loremaster skill, the more detailed the info you get.
Yeah, alright. Come on, I&apos;ll show you.
Perhaps this is the power you seek? I&apos;ve been waiting for the right customer to come along for these - but I warn you, power doesn&apos;t come cheap. Even for someone as attractive as you.

[DWARF] *Ancestor or no, you know a tyrant when you hear one. You won&apos;t submit.*&lt;br&gt;
*Like a lullaby, the melody lulls them both to sleep until with a start, the Red Prince wakes once more.*
Sadly I&apos;m all out of cash right now. My money is out on the street, working hard for someone else. You should have come earlier. Come back later, perhaps things will have... changed.
Bless you, Sebille. I bow before the Mother.
I think I know what this guy is going through. Poor thing.
Hey there, small fry. Where&apos;s your big cheese?
I pray the Seven guide Gwydian to safety.
*An unseen force tears at your shoulder. It yanks harder and harder, trying to rip the arm out of its socket.*
*Ask if the riddle does not normally go: &apos;what&apos;s black and white and red all over?&apos;*
*He looks at the corpses surrounding him. His lost son. His lost daughter. He tries to choke back tears, but soon they flow free, carving rivers through the grime on his face.*
*Burp!* Ungh... reckon that was. Reckon that was. Reckon. One too many.
The death of the flesh is one of the smallest deaths. I have not passed on to the Hall of Echoes, nor do I ever intend to.
Wine Barrel
A demon is no more to me, frankly, than a sickness awaiting the scalpel.
*Tell her you see where she&apos;s going with this, but that if you were interested in wooing a ball of slime you&apos;d be courting the contents of your handkerchief.*
Something you can sing along to, eh?
*Say you stand by your decision. You must refuse his offer to teach you.*
Maybe once. Before I cut you off from your precious candles. Did it hurt, when I snuffed them out? Did you feel the loss of each one as their power fell away from you?
*The spirit&apos;s distraught expression slides away in an instant, revealing that of a highly-composed - and thoroughly unimpressed - lizard spirit.*
[BARBARIAN] *Grab your weapon with a guttural snarl. You&apos;ve had enough of these games.*
It seems the Seven grew complacent. When the darkness comes for me, I shall not be found &apos;hanging about.&apos;
[OUTLAW] *Grin and tell her this sounds like your kind of party.*
*Say that if you&apos;re forced to slay him, you&apos;ll just make the next Lone Wolf talk. So he might as well do the talking: remain alive.*
That&apos;s... That&apos;s quite alright, milord.
I feel... I feel life under my fingertips.
*Ask where the cub&apos;s mother is.*
*Tell her you&apos;re no thief.*
You ask for it now, killer!
*The creature leans forward to get a better look at you, clucking and tutting under her breath.*
*Tell her it was the best night of your life.*
*He punctuates his point by rapping his own head a few times.*
The ship snapped like kindling! That Voidwoken was impressive. Terrifying, but impressive.
The Divine died in battle.
*Power seeps out of the jar, a whispered promise of magic. But as soon as you feel it tingling on your skin, your Source collar locks tight around your neck, burning and squeezing you.*
When the crackdowns and decrees came, I defended her. When she exiled her cousin Marcus, I joined in the applause. But this new plan of hers... I want to believe, I do. But... Deathfog? Something&apos;s not right.

*It wants a magic word! Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;Arx&apos; and &apos;Lucian&apos;s Day&apos;.*
But until he dies, you will be locked in the Hall of Echoes. I am not strong enough to free you alone.
A painting depicting the winged salvation of Rhalic: one of the Seven and primary god of all humans.
Keeping the dead as slaves? What a disgusting display! She deserves every punishment she got.
Jimmy, prithee wake thyself!
*You wonder what happened. Did you sleep with her?*
Lucian did have a... soft spot for a delicate thing like yourself. We&apos;ve given the wolves and worms enough to feast on. Besides...
Blade X
I call on the God King! &lt;b&gt;COME CLAIM WHAT IS YOURS!&lt;/b&gt;
Truth be told, I&apos;ve disagreed heartily with some of what you&apos;ve done along this way we&apos;re making. If things continue like this... I&apos;m leaving.
The ghosts of Seekers stood guard over Karon.
Peace, my child. You will have your answers - but I may only give one at a time.
Unnis&apos; Pouch
It worked! I heard gears moving.
*Say you&apos;ll be sure to visit his family when you&apos;re done with Saheila and Alexandar.*
*Say you&apos;re more concerned with achieving godhood at the moment.*

Giant Hill Troll
With the collar off, you&apos;ll be &lt;i&gt;unstoppable&lt;/i&gt;. Don&apos;t you want that yoke off&apos;a ya?
Quest Marker
Today, though - I don&apos;t know. The Paladins once fought the Black Ring at Lucian&apos;s command. The most courageous thing they could do now is turn their backs on the Order. I&apos;m not holding my breath.
You lie. You &lt;i&gt;thieve&lt;/i&gt;.
*He stares at you silently for a long moment, then gathers his cloak tighter around himself.*
So the House of Shadows thinks Sadha a threat: their Shadow Prince wants me to kill her because she will be the mother of dragons.
*Wonder what you have to do when you get there.*
*Nod a greeting and say you&apos;re eager to set sail. How long do they plan to remain at anchor?*
I will not fail our God King. He will find me worthy of eternity...
Female Lizard Dreamer
*Tell him you came from Fort Joy. You&apos;ve seen first hand the folly of treating others ill.*
Cursed Fire Arrowhead
*Exclaim that he&apos;s performing an injustice. Ask if Lucian would approve of this brutality.*
Nothing&apos;s doing here. All the fun seems to be over at the Cathedral.
A Sourcerer, crucified and tortured. See for yourself, if you&apos;re that interested. But don&apos;t get too close, if you like living.
A cowardly act! But worry not Sadha. There are other paths we can take. I will simply have to kill the God King myself.
Prepare for justice, criminal!
Shut it, you.
The bird refused our offer of help.
Sebille! You killed the Mother! We are free. We may go where we please.
[UNDEAD] *Ask him how he has survived out here without masking himself.*
*Smile and say you can think of no finer delicacy.*
*Nod.*
*Tarquin&apos;s smirk wilts into a glower.*
* - and then she is gone.*
Naught to be gained by &lt;i&gt;peace, &lt;/i&gt;fear I.
*Eat the egg.*
*Remind her that she mentioned a &apos;vault&apos; before. Ask where you can find it.*
*You are suddenly heavy on your feet. The air here feels weighted with import - and dread. All light within you feels suddenly dimmer.*
*Kneel before the altar and whisper a quiet prayer to the humans&apos; god. Perhaps here, in his own temple, you can talk to him.*

A Family Affair
&lt;br&gt;To Braccus Rex, My Betrothed:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been some years now since you lost your temper with me in such an unseemly manner, and put our engagement on the long finger as it were. Nevertheless, I remain willing to overlook your inadequacies and forgive you. Release me from this oozing, fiery body that you have trapped me in, and I may still allow you to take my hand in marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours impatiently,&lt;br&gt;Her Most Royal Highness, &lt;br&gt;Princess Zenthia of the Fire Lands
Both of them long for power so absolute it&apos;s no more than an abstract. Yet it is that very abstract that causes so much actual misery for those that stand in its way.
Silence! Your trial is complete, your sentence is set, and my patience is thin.

Better to knock it all down and start again.
You sure? You look a bit like my uncle. Still, we&apos;ll all look the same in the darkness.

I&apos;ve earned good gold in dealings with lizards in the past... &lt;i&gt;but &lt;/i&gt;your kind are out of favour with many in Arx... I can&apos;t be seen talking to you. Appearances and all...
She has been tried by her service and found guilty by her failings. She disobeyed orders and cost Paladins their lives.
&lt;i&gt;I am a Magister!&lt;/i&gt; Don&apos;t you understand?! Even if they don&apos;t want me in their ranks anymore, I&apos;ll always be one of them! Now answer me!
Yeah, right. I&apos;m too busy right now to arrest you... *sips.* ...but &apos;fore you go, perhaps you can help us settle an argument.
That&apos;s the last I&apos;ll do for you - now leave this place if you value your life.
It is a hellish c-c-curse. Please. Release us!
And that nose! Ugh! Mind you, the scar gives you a certain... something. I&apos;d keep the scar. No offence meant, mind!
Malady told me that a demonologist could help me with the demon inside me. The demonologist Jahan was last seen north of Driftwood.

You already know what is most important. Grandmaster Arhu is missing, and must be returned to the Paladins.
*Wearily say that you&apos;ll figure out whatever tricks he&apos;s put in place eventually - he might as well just tell you.*
