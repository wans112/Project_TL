Saheila thanked Sebille for killing the Mother Tree. She urged her to seek her own freedom and hopes to see her again.
An unconsecrated burial, perhaps. I could give her something more than a ditch, but less than a grave.
Stick with me and I&apos;ll introduce you to my pack leader: Roost. He doesn&apos;t take all comers, but... I&apos;ll vouch for you.
*Tell her that sounds very serious. Whatever is possessing her is powerful enough to invade the realm of the gods?*
So fret not, but revel in the promise of the lake! I will lead you there when you&apos;re ready: when you&apos;ve become a true Master of the Source, and speak the language of creation itself.
So what are you going to do now that the White Magister&apos;s jumped ship?
It means trouble, I can assure you. It was difficult enough excavating this site without these... distractions.
It won&apos;t budge. How inconvenient.
Creatures &amp; Items
*The maggot is caught in the pinch of the tweezers and plucked off in a single, swift movement.*
Nah. I&apos;m keeping it. I like it now.
*The spirit&apos;s scowl gives way to a roll of her eyes and an exasperated sigh.*
Sand Pile
The animal is busy feeding.
It is implausible because it has been made implausible. Our enemies are all too good at what they do.
On Lucian&apos;s Day? You&apos;d better believe it.
Your soul has become a vast enough expanse to house divinity. You are ready.
Platitudes are nice to hear. But they are only that. Platitudes.
*A formidable weapon. But you cannot use this one.*
Craftsman&apos;s Tome
*Duna, god of Dwarves, gasps: &apos;Please, cleanse this place. Let me breathe...&apos;*
Get away!
*You don&apos;t have time for this. If he won&apos;t tell you what he&apos;s hiding, you&apos;ll force it out of him.*
*Tell her it sounds as though she&apos;s purchased snake oil.*
The egg was destroyed.
Higba trusts us to help him escape.
*Ask how he came by that wound.*
Cast skill
I&apos;m a lucky man, I am.
Axe
*Say you&apos;re glad his research has yielded results, but you still have foes to face.*
Bloody Spittle
Knight of Vrogir Boots
*Remark that it could be worse - &apos;tis just a ring, after all.*
*She leans into you and kisses you passionately, her forked tongue finding yours, the tines entwining...*
This heavy shield has seen a hundred battles, but so sturdily was it wrought that it still looks brand new.
*Snicker. Boy, those were the days, weren&apos;t they... Chuck? Or is it Charlie?*
Creepy.
What a dismal way to wake: in the belly of the beast. Let&apos;s see if I can grope my way out.
Ha! I&apos;d figured you for someone who wouldn&apos;t buckle under their yoke so easily.
*Say you&apos;re sure he was. He was the &lt;i&gt;Divine,&lt;/i&gt; after all.*
Adramahlihk draws his power from souls trapped in candles. Snuff the flame and he weakens - but the poor soul is lost forever.
Shattergrasp
Naturally they acted as any lords would. They bowed to their king and sneered at their lessers.
Folks are folks; he made his own choice. Nothing to do but carry on.
Incredible power, contained in a single name.
I&apos;m watching you, stranger.
Unlock your Hotbar to drag items in and out of it.
Gundallow
Patrons of the Black Bull will continue to enjoy Wyvlia&apos;s special stew.
Fair&apos;nuff. Forget it then.
XP Reward
Looking at this, I&apos;d say we&apos;re close to Lucian&apos;s body.
Kathleen&apos;s Plum Wine 1489
You still don&apos;t look lost.
...with friends and lovers find your true repose.
Marg didn&apos;t have the intellect to be a successful bridge troll. Not like &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
[VILLAIN] *Tell him the ringing bell was the cause of the wreck. Everyone died and it&apos;s his fault. He&apos;d better stop right now.*
What is this place...?
Show us what you can do, Godwoken.
Explode, dealing [1] in a large area around you, creating a Blood surface.
The Essence of Existence, Volume Two
*Confront her about Kemm&apos;s painting. You know she has it - and you are taking it!*
But... what makes me any better than them? Maybe there was another way...
Some sort of force is preventing us from using the lever. We&apos;ll need to figure out just what it is that is hindering us.

Look, I know you&apos;re him. I know you can take care of problems. And I&apos;ve got &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;the problem for you. A very lucrative one...
We found the demonic Advocate with his minions on Bloodmoon Island.
Lava
Vrogir&apos;s culture was so focused on brutality and violence, yet they write so beautifully of it!
*Shout that you were shipped here and collared like a beast. He and his Order need to be stopped.*
*Ask what happened here. What could lead to such brutality?*
&apos;Here lies Roland Harkwood.&lt;br&gt;Beloved husband of Prudence.&lt;br&gt;Attentive father to Kniles.&lt;br&gt;Buried near his daughters.&apos;
I&apos;d say your guess is as good as mine, &apos;cept I&apos;ve got the sense not to ask any questions. Now why don&apos;t you march on? I ain&apos;t bein&apos; paid to wag me chin.
*Tell him to cease flooding the orc temple at once, and to move his troops out.*
Tarquin claims he was forced to resurrect Braccus. With Anathema he could have killed the king, but in our distrust we failed to retrieve it.
*You&apos;re in a great dark, and endless black waste. Uneasy, you follow your guide in utter silence. Unseen tendrils lash about you, as if... searching for prey.*
Hmm. I suspect you collect memories not for knowledge, but from fear. Your homeland fell to the ravages of war and Deathfog. You worry of more loss, more loneliness. Tell me, elf. &lt;i&gt;Are you afraid?&lt;/i&gt;
They haul barrels of the greatest weapons in the world off a ship, and then decide to throw them in the ocean?!
I can do that. I know where Lucian is. But it&apos;s not &lt;i&gt;quite &lt;/i&gt;as simple as that.
Of course. Well, first things first.
*Say yes! You can&apos;t wait to see what will happen next.*
*Tell him you&apos;d rather the contents of the safe.*
No it isn&apos;t.
Leya
*He casts one appraising eye over the planks strewn on the ground and those still nailed to the ship. His brow furrows in calculation.*
&lt;i&gt;Kill him now.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ifan nods once, and throws you a half smile.*
&apos;The likelihood of an operator lying about quadrupeds shaking the framing device was also calculated at one in two. Operator&apos;s manner and language indicated hostility to the machine.&apos;
Lucian knew that if he &lt;i&gt;asked&lt;/i&gt; me to deliver the Deathfog, I would have refused. Point blank. That&apos;s why he lied to me.
*The memory fades, but your heart stays heavy.*
*Smile at it, and beckon it on...*
No... &lt;i&gt;no!&lt;/i&gt; I don&apos;t know. I DON&apos;T KNOW!
The world seems fine to me, Godscum.
Good luck to you. And &lt;i&gt;thank you&lt;/i&gt;.
*Say you met her. Magisters were after her, but you managed to help her get rid of them before it was too late.*
[BEAST] *Tell him to trust you: This is a lost cause. If he wants to get out of here alive, he&apos;s going to have to lay down his weapons and trust in the gods.*
*Lean close and whisper in his ear. Tell him that you will burn the world if it will save the kin.*
I cannot set sail while the bell still rings!
*Inform Alexandar of the Sallow Man&apos;s demise.*
Item Parameters
Dunno where to just yet, but hey! A new beginning. Wish me luck!
Ah. Well there you have it. Drudgery in life and insult in death.
Wireless Controller Layout
I can&apos;t make heads nor tails of this...
Encounter [1]
All that digging for nothing.
I... I failed you. He&apos;s not coiled around your heart; he has become your heart. Try as I might, he would not shift.
*His face falls.*
*She sizes you up as you approach. Her eyes narrow.*
Deactivated Automaton
The Merryweather
Lizard&apos;s Morningstar
The ancient red. The hated red. I have come to rend the red.
*Ask it what it can tell you about moving the ship.*
Over there, among the blood; in the darkness of the ruins; amid the mangled dead, his name still rings, however faint - for once spoken, the echo of a demon&apos;s name never truly fades.
A pamphlet urging the dwarves of Driftwood to unite against the Divine Order.
Did you tell him what you thought of his little picture?
You are favoured. I will not harm you... unless you want me to.
*With a glint in her eye, she raises her hand, and shows you her rings.*
Then the vault is real? I can&apos;t believe it! What did you find? Do show me, please!
Craft a new mask.
Leap to destination and apply Haste to yourself.
*The Magister snatches the ring from your palm and stares at it.*
And don&apos;t you mistake my compliment for it either. Snakeface.
An excellent decision, decisively delivered! It is indeed within my ingenuity to grant such a boon. Understand, Godwoken, that Source abounds in all things.
No. NO! PLEASE! PLEASE!
*He peers into your eyes, looking for a sign of honest intent - and satisfied, his face softens.*
She&apos;s just being protective! It&apos;s her way. She&apos;s a good mum, she is! I want my mum.
You&apos;re playing with fire, Godwoken. But far be it from me to come between you and what you consider entertainment.
You got something against idiots and maniacs?
Come child... let me show you...
Go on. We&apos;re all watching. Watch and learn, fellas! Watch and learn.
Ashen Idol of Rebirth
Caution: starting a new Honour Mode game with this profile will overwrite your previous Honour Mode save game!
Couch
Griff is a powerful man. Power is mysterious. In case you haven&apos;t *ahem* noticed.
*Say that&apos;s all well and good until you land yourself a wound that won&apos;t heal.*
Gone? Eggs? Eggy babies? ALL gone?
You&apos;re lucky to stand in a town protected by Magister Reimond&apos;s wisdom. Without him the Voidwoken would have turned this slum into a charnel house. He will be missed when he sails.
*The dwarf moans and squints, then holds his palm over his head to block out the light.*
*The air is thick with heavy flakes of ash. The altar before you seems to radiate heat as you approach.*
Jug
an unknown item
*You feel the collar start to twist - a living, writhing thing fighting for survival. With a scream of tortured metal the collars snap, falling broken from your necks.*
*Implore him to enjoy his newfound mobility.*
Out of lure!
*Wonder why she&apos;s telling you this and not Gareth.*
*The Sallow Man&apos;s pallid countenance appears within the glass. Silently, unrelentingly, with &lt;i&gt;avarice, &lt;/i&gt;he asks you for Alexandar&apos;s head. And then he fades away.*
*Tell her that you intend to craft the Swornbreaker yourself - you&apos;ll need the tablet back in order to do so.*
*The fanatic hisses in disdain, but the Dreamer ignores him completely.*
Facing annihilation in the wars between the Divine and the Void, the Mother Tree tried to take the whole world for the elves.
Barter
You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a Sourcerer, are you not? Perhaps even... Godwoken? Tell me true, now.
Sweet sir. &lt;i&gt;Handsome &lt;/i&gt;sir. Seek out our master, he wants you...
*Tell him that Divinity is nobody&apos;s birthright. He should stand aside, and let someone else take their shot at the Well of Ascension.*
*He winces and recoils, then quickly regains his composure.*
Large Wits Potion
Human Prisoner
My dear... why, I can&apos;t remember the last time someone&apos;s helped me like this... perhaps even never! When the final hour comes, I will stand by your side, I promise...
Slider
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Soon, you can rest.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Hah. Give it a rest. I don&apos;t like liars.
