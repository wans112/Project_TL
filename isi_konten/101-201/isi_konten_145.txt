(I don&apos;t think a thank you &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;enough, Mabel. I&apos;d better mark his map for him.) Uh... thank you so very much?
A simple oversight that comes with habit: a door left slightly ajar - that was all I needed to feel a rush of blood, a thirst for liberation like never before.
*Tell him you wish him peace but won&apos;t commit murder on his behalf.*
*Curtly respond that it was no suggestion - you don&apos;t want whatever pestilence it has to spread to others.*
*Your flag flies for Braccus Rex, a tyrant who traded for your soul. With his power, your flesh and blood is no longer relevant.*
That is your guarantee. When you get to the crypt and you find our friend Lucian, I shall come to call.
*Insist she explain herself. What is going on here?*
I don&apos;t trust a single word out of your mouth. Confess, criminal!
Cut it out. That&apos;s not yours!
*The creature seems anxious. Its head swivels loosely on its neck as it scans the area.*
Blast. Well, if you do see anything odd - report it immediately. There is a foul creature lurking in one of these shadows, and we &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;find him.
There. Better.
Touch anything down here, and I&apos;ll put your carcass on a gibbet. Now keep out of my way.
I shall return home to the Empire, when the Magisters have cooled their ardour. For now, I&apos;ll hide out here. It should be safe enough.
*Something catches you around the chest and you fall. The rough ground scrapes burns into the flesh of your bare arms, your knees, your face, you, as you skid to a stop. Footsteps approach.*
A mysterious seed given to you by Maol.
Look for Gwydian&apos;s parents&apos; house.
*The little girl&apos;s spirit gazes at you.*
You&apos;re free to do as you please. Though I don&apos;t expect you&apos;ll find the Arx you were expecting.
They ate my flesh, and they want more. &lt;i&gt;They want my Source. &lt;/i&gt;
Magic Armour absorbs magical damage. As long as your Magic Armour is above 0, you are immune to magic statuses like Burning and Stunned.

Battle the demon.
[SEBILLE] *Smile and think better of saying what you&apos;re thinking: Whoever the murderer is, they could stand to learn that bloodletting is an art, not a sport.*
*Lohse clears her throat and starts stomping a steady beat into the ground, kicking up dust that dances to the rhythm. Slowly, she claps an intricate pattern above the beat, hips swaying, head nodding.*
*Release the spirit&apos;s hand.*

Higba has a bomb. If he&apos;s cornered... BOOM.
*The Source from the jar flows out, you can feel its invisible presence all around you. You reach out to touch it when the collar around your neck contracts, squeezing tight.*
I... I hold secrets. I hold truths. I am a Scion - a keeper of memories. A keeper of my people. I see much. And I see you.
*Tell him you can heal him. Or try, anyway.*
*The hunger deep inside you will be sated. But not for long. It wants more. It wants so much more.*
Me too. Best damn friend a man could have.
*Ask the bull what happened here.*
*Deny her accusation. You have no malicious intentions.*
*He takes the news calmly. A moment passes as he calculates the consequences, assessing this new world as it opens up before him. He nods his thanks.*

I proclaim thee the Champion of the Driftwood arena! Get yer gloat on, &apos;n&apos; take a swig of ale. Hell, take a dozen. We&apos;ll be singin&apos; for years to come of the great scaled Void-slayer!
Undead Rogue
&lt;i&gt;Or what? &lt;/i&gt;Shall you kill me with your fog of death, like you did my cousins? &lt;i&gt;This is our only chance to live.&lt;/i&gt;
*She mutters in her sleep...*
I should. I &lt;i&gt;should &lt;/i&gt;scare you.
Who can truly know a diseased mind? She is rotten to the core, that I am sure of.

The Divine? No excuses, there&apos;s &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; divine about one who could do that...
Soon!
I guess I can go now. I hope the next place is better. This was a bad place. A &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;bad place.
*Laugh and say you aren&apos;t sure. Does he see any Source about you?*
*Nod in understanding and let it feed. It will be free of his hunger and anger soon.*
The game has ended!
*Threaten to drag him out of that cave by his ears if he doesn&apos;t talk.*
Kajun Frozenheart
That&apos;s an idea... a nice idea.
*You watch a figure stride through a cavern of amethyst and rose quartz. A man. No light touches this place, yet the stones and minerals illuminate his way.*
*Say that you are here to free whichever part of him is demon-possessed, as you promised Brother Kelvin.*
*Ask if he&apos;s discovered anything further about the fish.*
*Ignore his question, and ask about the fugitive that he mentioned.*
Directions, milady! I was bid to send you to none other than Brahmos the Wanderer!
The Aeteran now contains almost all of the Source the Seven stole. Soon, we will be able to heal the Veil.
Find it. Destroy it. &lt;i&gt;Make it leave me be&lt;/i&gt;.
*Let out an agonising cry and insist she skip ahead to the important part.*
Help me! Help me! I&apos;m not trying to escape - I swear! Make him leave, take him away!
*Comment that she has a lead on where to find Roost. She must be happy.*
Two-Handed
You&apos;re here for the fun and the fantasy, but not for a rigorous challenge.
*Tell him you think all that time in the ground might have dulled his senses...*
*Peering in, you can barely see, as your vision is limited by a cobweb draped across the hatch. You think you see an empty room carpeted with sand. It&apos;s quiet in the room. &lt;i&gt;Too&lt;/i&gt; quiet.*
*Rise to your full height. Thank Saheila. You&apos;ve gotten what you needed.*
*Ask Swann to heal you.*
*The spirit twists in anguish - it desperately wants to be free. To move on. Eventually the fog starts to clear.*
Sets Shocked on target. Deals [1] when targeted at a character.
Goodness. Why must the dwarven mind be so &lt;i&gt;feeble?&lt;/i&gt; To think, a simpleton touched with Divinity. The Gods really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;cruel.
*Gareth winks farewell and hums to himself. You recognise the tune: &apos;Blessed and Bold&apos;, a hymn praising Lucian.*
*Ask if she knows what brought the Voidwoken to the gates.*
No, it&apos;s &apos;in the beginning Lucian was the word&apos;.
Moving to involuntary death assistant!
You&apos;re gonna help Wither, aren&apos;t you? I bet you could if you wanted to...
For heaven&apos;s sake would you please... Oh! Ever so sorry. I thought you were that rotten butler, about to warn me once again &apos;to take the ocular not the tactile approach&apos;.
[HERO] *Tell her to look you in the eyes. Hold her gaze - smooth, calm, and confident.*
*The dwarf remains huddled in a trembling ball. She ignores you completely.*

We ventured onwards, Eleanessa&apos;s fate behind us.
Lucian&apos;s Divine Staff
So where&apos;s Joe?
It was a mistake to join you. I should be looking for my own kind, by myself. Farewell.

*The vision flashes away and you are alone, vibrating with the force of the expulsion.*
[DWARF] *Say that you cannot kill one of your own.*
I know what I was, dear; I know what I am - and am no longer.
*Ifan is silent for a long spell. He finally turns to you with a slow nod, a look of hope in his eyes.*
&lt;i&gt;the dark&lt;/i&gt;
Ah. I thought the ancestor&apos;s screams had drawn you here as well. They came to me on the wind - though I am not sure the devil&apos;s breath that perturbs the air here can rightly be called &apos;wind&apos;.
The suavely dangerous Shadow Prince and his shadowy assassins were defeated.
*Alexandar casts his gaze upwards for a moment, and murmurs a quick prayer.*
*Gareth raises his blade and tightens his grip - but falters. He cannot strike the final blow.*

*Purr.*
*Lava roils as earthquakes rumble around you. Shockwaves of sound pierce the air - the growl of shifting ground. Suddenly, a voice echoes in your mind.*
Hey you! Uh.. Well. Hello citizen.
Ifan! You&apos;ve come not a moment too soon. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt; Even &lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt;
I know you didn&apos;t. You only... inadvertently did.

Friend! How does life find ya?
*He&apos;s taking commands from the Magisters? Ask if he&apos;s... one of them.*
What&apos;ll it be, lizard? The likes of you should be able to handle something two-handed with ease. Or is it range you&apos;re after?
I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.

If you ever find yourself face to face with Magisters, you tell them I was tortured. I didn&apos;t betray the cause, not until I was near death... understand?
*Ask what&apos;s going on here - of what does that woman stand accused?*
If there was ever a house that was haunted, well, that&apos;s the one. They say almost no-one gets in - and those who do &lt;i&gt;never come out. &lt;/i&gt;Perhaps he feeds them cake, hmm?
