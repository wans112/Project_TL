*Ask him what he thinks he sees inside Lohse.*
&lt;br&gt;Can only be used once per combat&lt;br&gt;
*He closes his eyes once more and returns to his prayers.*
*The man doesn&apos;t respond to you - he&apos;s senseless from the pain.*
True Brew: Whisperwood
A map. Nice!
The lizards inside the consulate never stood a chance. It&apos;s all the bloody Magisters&apos; fault - they can add the dead to their butcher&apos;s bill.
Everything is a choice. &lt;i&gt;Everything.&lt;/i&gt;
Would &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;trust &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;with something that could control you completely?
If I weren&apos;t on orders from Griff, I&apos;d smash in that pointy little face of yours.
*Tell her that you&apos;ve found the vault that she mentioned.*
*Offer to patch that up for him.*
There is no shame in finding solace in shelter. Or do you feel much guilt in enjoying the peace of the sanctuary?
*Tell him you&apos;re taking over - he and his people should stand back.*
Agh! Help!
On Reaperâ€™s Eye, I again met the Sourcerer who sank the Merryweather. She was begging her lord for forgiveness. Who is this lord?
[UNDEAD] *Remark that even the most learned of people tend to recoil upon seeing an undead... is he &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;that he had no experience of necromancy?*
*Ifan freezes, and a cold anger emanates from him. He draws his weapon... then lets it hang by his side as he realises how useless it is against a spirit. Without a flicker of fear on her face, she smirks back at him.*
I&apos;m a musician. Singer, lute-player, jester, mystic, daughter, friend, lover... and now... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. You&apos;re one too, right?
You are hardly alone in your hunt. I&apos;d see her head mounted on my wall.
And none to me.
I... appreciate your concern, but I&apos;m sure you understand I&apos;m quite &lt;i&gt;overcome &lt;/i&gt;at the moment.
The Doctor&apos;s door will only admit Lohse.
Maddelyn Kemm
Well I&apos;m still quite keen on getting this parasite out of my head. First: that. Then: &lt;i&gt;Dallis.&lt;/i&gt;
Leather Helmet
*Give up and turn away.*

She ought to come with you then. She ought to follow you back to me.
*Cranley Huwbert&apos;s eyes bulge with amazement.*
*Request that he tell about these &apos;Shriekers&apos; that the Magisters are using.*

You&apos;re right. Those murderers will regret the day they ever set foot on this island. Let&apos;s go.

*Take your leave.*
My husband Griff and I, we taught the local kids what we could. History, politics, writing, reading. A little cooking, a little alchemy. The parents paid what they could. It was enough.
*Tap him on the shoulder.*
Warning
*You see a shape emerge from the ruins of the broken jar - a lizard in the finest necromancer robes. It grudgingly nods at you as it starts to fade from the mortal realm.*
Main Attributes
It&apos;s... it&apos;s the armour. This lab - the Magisters were experimenting with old elven magic.
The Divine Order attacked the elven homelands with Deathfog, leaving elvendom teetering on the brink of oblivion.
It&apos;s... true, what you say. My belly&apos;s as yellow as a canary. But when the Hammer comes calling, you don&apos;t refuse.
Ha! Of course you never found it. You always lacked imagination, &lt;i&gt;Lord &lt;/i&gt;Rhalic.
*Just kiss him. There&apos;s been enough war for one day.*

A Scion contains all the memories of our people. When a Scion dies, it takes root and becomes an ancestor tree. And our memories are forever bound within its roots.
We escaped from Fort Joy. We can no longer help Magister Yarrow.
Defeat haunts you like a spectre. Fail once more, and there will be consequences. Now accept the Covenant once more, and you shall be raised up.
Do not speak to me of trouble. Darkness lies ahead. But I am yours to command; my will is of no consequence. And so, as I must, I say...
*Say that you&apos;re simply expressing an interest.*
*Hold your empty hands aloft and give her an easy smile. Tell her to trust her instincts - she knows deep down you tell the truth.*
What madness could have caused THIS mess?
*The child is frozen in place.*
*Back away.*
What&apos;s this? It... trembles in my hand...
Notes on White Tea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The paler the brew, the more potent its effects. White tea has long been known to give stamina and longevity to even the tiredest traveller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortified with &apos;Liquid Moonshine&apos;, soldiers are often able to accomplish even more in battle than they thought possible of themselves.
&lt;i&gt;Dog!&lt;/i&gt;
A cursed arrow that lands like a witch&apos;s kiss, draining the fervour of any foe.
See? Nay. Sense? Good gods, yes.

The spirits bound to each piece shall shepherd your ascension. Restore it by devouring our souls, and you will be unmatched!
The Path &amp; The Pilgrimage
Seems like the only work these days is in fixin&apos; weapons. This world, eh?
[LOHSE] *Ask him if bad things happen when you open the chest.*
*Tell him he&apos;s an idiot.*
Red Snapper

Swamp Frog
Dallis! My name has been restored - I will not let you take it from me again!
Hey! Snake-face! What ya heard about a crate of stolen supplies? And don&apos;t you lie to me now.
*It looked like the squirrel was trying to say something earlier in the swamps. Ask what he wanted.*
Never mind. What&apos;s done is done. I don&apos;t know where I went wrong with you, but... it&apos;s too late now.
Abandon hope, kin. The last of the Scions betrays us.
*Commiserate with her plight. Few fates are worse than hers.*
You look a little short on the requisite brain-power, but I shouldn&apos;t think that&apos;d stop you. Good day to you. Don&apos;t let the door hit you on your way out.
Shiv
*Step forward. Fall into his arms.*
Bugger.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him sin is relative. You did what you did and you&apos;d do it again.*
You want me to abandon them? To leave them to burn for eternity under the Void? I understand that you&apos;re angry, but...
&apos;ey up!
Bouncing Shield

Lohar laughed at us. Our bag was sitting on the table beside him.

A bubble in and up.

The White Magisters were in these barracks when the fighting began - an entire cabal of them. If we find them, we will find Dallis. I have no doubt.
Character has escaped from jail.
*Looking closer, you notice a spot of red through the swirling sand, and you hear a voice. She sings... she beckons...*
&apos;Here lies Jinn Arkanaa, noted fencer.&lt;br&gt;&apos;A near-unblemished record.&apos;&apos;
*Remark that you could probably stand around guessing forever and get nowhere.*
You are &lt;i&gt;wonderful!&lt;/i&gt; As well as those others things I called you, but I hope you&apos;ll ignore my unwarranted honesty there.
Decide what to do with the boy Karon.
Oooh, I don&apos;t know all what you just said, but it sure sounds awesome!
The gods are fools if they think a few pretty words can turn us to treason. Let us stand together - &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; the Seven if need be.
Hold
*Gareth pauses, then shakes his head.*
&lt;i&gt;Patience rots with every breath. Speak!&lt;/i&gt;
If we can survive the Divine Order&apos;s most secure prison, then we can survive whatever we may find outside it.

You&apos;re right. Is that what you want to hear? You&apos;re right. Go, and tell everyone how &lt;i&gt;right &lt;/i&gt;you are. But you know what your rightness won&apos;t do? Protect a kingdom. And protect it I did, while you went off to live your Gods-damned pirate fantasy.
We just had to execute one of our own for disobedience, so don&apos;t think we&apos;ll tolerate any meddling from the likes of you. Tread carefully.
Soulforged Crossbow
Scroll Of Atonement
[LOHSE] *Tell her you&apos;re doing pretty well, actually. Fame, success, talent, friends... life&apos;s been good to you.*
*Ask him why they didn&apos;t wait until you could give the escape portal to the elves.*
The ship won&apos;t sail. We had orders to search every corner of it, and figure out what&apos;s blocking us. It&apos;s hewn from elven livewood; I thought I could communicate with it, but...
*The pressure now threatens to crush your lungs, your heart, your soul. And then it lifts, just as the spirit dissolves into oblivion with a spectral scream.*
Projectiles
To be honest, I&apos;ve reached the end of my tether with what &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;can do here...
Elves grace Rivellon with such beauty - even in death.
You&apos;ve been set on the path to Divinity. You&apos;ve &apos;awoken&apos; to this destiny, if you will. And you must see it done if the dwarven kingdom is to survive and thrive.
Words that mend: I thank you for them.
Got any fives?
Next Item/Enemy
*She opens her hands - and between them opens a tiny portal. A book drops from it. She catches it, and hands it to you.*
*Her eyes flash with something - anger, perhaps, or fear.*
*Squint right back at him. What is it he thinks you seek?*
*She looks to you and smiles.*
A twisted, spotted serpent is drawn upon the label of this amber wine.
Wait - you&apos;re no Magister. You&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer&lt;/i&gt;. What are you doing here, filthy lizard? Choose your words carefully; my fists ache to meet a new face.
Garrick&apos;s Chest
Oh, goodness. The disappointment is clouding your pretty face.
Sun-baked
*There is a faint rumble from within the statue, followed by a feral moan.*
It seems the Peacemaker has lost her deadly cargo.
Her cell is just over there. I can let you in, but...
Good luck, love. Take care of yourself against those nasties.
*Hard stares point your way from nearby sellers and buyers. The atmosphere is decidedly not friendly.*
The annals of elvendom are written in flesh - elves eat of the dead and absorb their memories. Now, the elves are in peril. An unforgettable hero must rise.
Day 31 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s time. There isn&apos;t any more I can do. I can only pray that it was enough. May the Gods forgive me.
*Thank him. You&apos;ll talk to the cook.*
*Shudder as you remember what you&apos;ve done. Look around for Saheila.*
*Tell her she&apos;s beautiful.*

When it is time for you to leave, Master, I will be ready. I serve no-one but you.
The feast begins! Praise to the Devourer! Praise to the one who hungers in his name!
