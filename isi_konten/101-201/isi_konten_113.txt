*Tarquin pauses. He adopts a thin smile, but cannot conceal the wariness in his eyes. His defences are up.*
So you dare defy the will of Braccus Rex? Prepare to die, and so on and so forth. Let&apos;s get this over with.
Disembodied Leg
Wordless
You&apos;ll die for making a dirty offer like that!
*Tell Mabel her recipes had better be good. &lt;i&gt;And they&apos;d better be free.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Hold up the writ Magister Reimond gave you. You&apos;ve got permission to free her.*
I mean... I&apos;m not opposed to becoming all-powerful. Would prefer to do it without taking anyone else out, though...
Sap Rain
Thank you for your custom, traveller.
I met the mysterious voice that saved me from the sea - it was my god, reaching out to me.
*Ignore the pounding in your head and push on, deeper into the smoke.*
Don&apos;t you dare look me in the eyes, &lt;i&gt;slave&lt;/i&gt;, for that is all you are now that you bow to the God King!
A blotched and stained book introducing the joys of cookery in the wild.
*The lizard sleeps on.*
I do wish Alexandar would ascend sooner rather than later.
This vegetal creature has been blessed by the benevolent warmth of the sun. If it also gets Wet, it will become Overgrown!
His was an exercise in power. Brutal, like all true power is.
*Ask what&apos;s got him so excited. That was nothing more than a rat.*
*Ask about the prison. How did she end up in her cell?*
&lt;i&gt;My sword? &lt;/i&gt;Let me tell you something: I fought in the Great War. I took this weapon from a Black Ring scout I killed with my own bare hands. Then I came home to work, and work I did. And what was my reward?
*The creature is quiet once more, save its constant wheeze.*
*It wants a magic word! Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;ruin&apos; and &apos;island&apos;.*
*Admit that you still have some way to go.*
Interrogate Alexandar.
*Squeak*
*Tell them to wait! Maybe you can talk about this?*
Demira&apos;s Amulet
*The creature harumphs.*
[Arena_AvailablePlayer_3_ed640a14-91d4-472d-b92b-b042b8011fde]
Speak with the spirit of Liam.
*The severed head closes its eyes, pretends it&apos;s dead.*
I don&apos;t find what I need, but I sure do find something! Let&apos;s get you to a prison cell.
Yes! Where they roast your bottom over a grill! That&apos;ll teach him to leave me stranded among those red-robes with their prickly magic sticks!
By Lucian&apos;s sword, elf, we meet again! Would that circumstances were better here than in Fort Joy. But they are not; Voidwoken lie in wait beyond the bridge.
*Slap him across the cheek. Time to snap out of it!*
*Ignore his demand, and say that his deeds here will follow him for the rest of his days... maybe even beyond.*
Small Viscous Egg
How- how could this happen?
The Scion told us she is trying to create a set of armour from poisonous spores.
Monster-slayer! Rest assured we have your back.
Flaming Two Handed Axe
and within seven generations had emptied.
O ye of little faith.
My Queen: the scaled specimen before you is a Godwoken - a claimant to the divine throne.
A word of warning; there are lizards in the house. Kemm trusts them - but I do not.
*Your own heart beats faster. Your gut tightens. The entire Mother Tree shudders, and then you hear her screaming - calling out to all of the elves. You may be in trouble.*
*Growl that she&apos;d better start talking sense soon. What does she mean the Gods were Eternals?*
*Actually, you just remembered - you don&apos;t care.*
Devour Corpse
Poison Arrow
Ha! Yes, what a reunion that was.
[UNDEAD] *You&apos;re about to explain that you can&apos;t remember any songs when a tune comes to you. You start to croon a centuries-old song...*
This key is already in use.
Elemental Totem
*You see the man who took her from you. A beast. A pig. Roost Anlon.*
*Think better of revealing your hand too soon. Tell him you aren&apos;t here to talk about you.*
I knew I saw some talent in you. Go ahead and combine the mushroom with the vial.
*Ask her if any part of her sob story was true.*
Zombie Crawler
Off-handing, beast!
For security reasons, please keep this door closed.
I tried a few silly puns to take the edge off him, but he barrels ahead like I&apos;ve said nothing at all!
You&apos;re not the one. No, no. Not you.
Ambition
*Decide that you need anyone who can heal.*
The best of the best. Taught her myself: Under the third rib and out again, just like that.
*The Captain&apos;s eyes widen in horror as the Void gapes before her... and then she is gone.*
*She thanks you with a smile and thumbs through the pages, engrossed by your work.*
Chain Lightning Skillbook
I am your death, Silver Claw. Time you paid what&apos;s due... I AM THE FATE YOU CHOOSE...
*Ask him what he&apos;s doing out here alone.*
*Reimond&apos;s spirit offers you a thin smile as he is consumed - zealous to the end.*
*Groans* Lemme show &apos;im what for...
Psst! Hey! Come on, don&apos;t act like I&apos;m not here.
Maniac
That makes me sad! I&apos;ll chase the bad things away!
Even without my guidance you have become a true Master of the Source. You are ready, and I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have something else to teach you...
What kind of Seeker do you want at your side?
*Her voice catches in her throat.*
We&apos;re in luck if it&apos;s merely our deaths she&apos;s after.
This is no elven stick-farm. This is Arx - mortar, rock and blood!
*Say that you&apos;re just an adventurer, and ask what happened.*
*Say a cat just purred.*
*As you gingerly pack the rotting appendage in your backpack, you have occasion to wonder - not for the first time on this journey - &lt;i&gt;&apos;what in the Void am I doing?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
You don&apos;t have enough on you to buy my silence, thief.
It most certainly &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be. The Well of Ascension is a lake: a pool of pure Source in which the powers of the Seven lie united.
Regards from Griff.
So, the Red Prince is here. &lt;i&gt;Interesting. &lt;/i&gt;If revolting...
You need to learn when to keep your hands to yourself. You&apos;re under arrest!
You take the first step towards godhood. Cost of all Source skills is modified by [1] Source Point(s).
Please, elf. Go.
*Ignore him. You&apos;ve been waiting for this. Shove your thumb deep into his eye.*
*You notice the lack of scuffing around the lock. It would seem that this chest does not require a key...*
My feelings exactly. *Spits.*
*Ah, well in that case, maybe not...*
Many of Lucian&apos;s loyalists in the Divine Order are none too happy with Dallis as their leader and have begun to desert.
That was before. Before the Knights of Drey decided... well, they &lt;i&gt;decreed&lt;/i&gt;...
Until we meet again, my child.
Godwoken?! No, wait - please! I&apos;ll tell you what I know. The sentinels - they&apos;re no danger when they&apos;re moving, but as soon as they stop, that means they&apos;re about to attack.
*Yank your finger away from his ribcage.*
*Take your leave, and promise you will find a way to douse the flames.*
Maul
*Across the cellar, a shape bearing &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;resemblance to a woman lurches around to face you. It utters a marrow-curdling gurgle.*
*Say it&apos;d &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;, given that you had to do it twice.*
My word! He has spoken! Lucian has spoken! The Eternal Prayer... it worked!
*She grins at you expectantly, eyebrows raised, encouraging you to elaborate.*
What are ye doin&apos;? There&apos;s work waitin&apos;. She&apos;ll kill us both, ye know!
You are blemish. You are filth. I&apos;ve come to wipe away the stain, Sebille.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without fulfilling Lohar&apos;s request.
Spirit of Almira
Lohar will want to know of this.
That&apos;s one way to look at it, I suppose. Gareth&apos;s a man of faith. Real faith. The kind you don&apos;t much see anymore.
I am death. There&apos;s no defying me.
You must not let the fire burn!
*You feel him in your head, scrabbling for purchase amongst your thoughts, looking for a way in, his madness and his anger and his hate banging on the door of your mind... looking for &lt;i&gt;Almira.*&lt;/i&gt;
Please tell me you&apos;re joking. Lohse if you leave now, there will be no saving you. There will be no &apos;you&apos; anymore at all.
Arrow Storm
Blackpeak Honeywine, 1194
It&apos;s only human to question. But you must also find your way back. Not just for you, but for everyone that relies on you.
CRACK! The Source collar&apos;s broken! I&apos;m free! Have at you, Dallis! I&apos;ll kill you again, Alexandar! I&apos;m a big bad Sourcerer! Woohoo!
*Tell her the truth. You met Duna, and he told you that you are more important than any member of your crew.*
It is &lt;i&gt;super&lt;/i&gt;natural! It is the ultimate lust for power. The true lust of a god!
You shame your kind, Godwoken - you will receive no wisdom from me. &lt;i&gt;Leave!&lt;/i&gt;
You there! You&apos;ve got the look of a thief. I need to look through your bags. All of them.
The Loremaster
This is the Academy - it is a place of great learning. I am the Seneschal - I serve both those who teach, and those who come to learn. Those like you.
*Say that all sounds rather contradictory. You wouldn&apos;t worry about it.*
What, do I have a target on my back or something?
*Back away slowly.*
Rotate Character
Deals [1] damage to target and applies Atrophy.
*As the heat around you fades, the desperate memory returns. It claws at you, trying to take hold, then slips away completely.*
Strange. Didn&apos;t I just kill you?
Faked his own death, did he? That&apos;s one way to avoid debtor&apos;s prison...
*Try to turn it.*
*Tell the child that you are, indeed, kin.*
Then leave.
&apos;Operation Downfall.&apos; To people like them, war&apos;s a pageant, ain&apos;t it? The queen puts on a show and the peons stand on their neighbours&apos; bones and applaud her pluck.
Plan Alexandar&apos;s assassination.
Why that would be excellent! I have been curious about this for some time. The social interactions, the expectations, the mechanics...
[MYSTIC] *Close your eyes and search the air for the flower&apos;s essence.*
I &lt;i&gt;would not &lt;/i&gt;advise that.
*You struggle in vain against the restraints binding you to the table. The gag muffles your screams as the scalpel is lowered to your flesh...*
Bishop Alexandar
Shaky Metal Grate
You&apos;ve no decency at all, have you.
Place your &apos;weighty gift&apos; on the altar.
Good. It is of the utmost importance that I reach the Blackpits and access the dig site there.
Crocodiles
Go to the table in the corner and pick up all the crafting components on the table.
*Say you feel comfortable; you are familiar with the game&apos;s various elements.*
Accord! Then *ahem* - allow me to begin.
Then my request must become a plea. A prayer. I regret succumbing to his gilded lies. But I know that you can rise up and rip away his grip on our world. You can still free Rivellon. You can still free &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
*Drawn upon the page is an elaborate schematic. It closely resembles the broken shrine to Duna in Mordus&apos; quarters, and depicts a mechanism operated by a button on the statue&apos;s back.*
*Insist he is free to enter the Hall. The Doctor is dead; his soul is unbound to this plane.*
*Ask about this place. They&apos;re growing drudanae?*
