Tales of the Seven Gods&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seven gods were still young when they decided that each of them should have their own race to guide through the eternal flow of time. And thus it happened that Rhalic, the most powerful of all gods, become the patron of the humans. The burly Duna created the dwarves in his own likeness and even lived alongside them in the mountainous caverns. Tir-Cendelius, the Poet, went into the woods and created the elves. He blessed them with near-immortality and wisdom. The reptile goddess Zorl-Stissa wished to command a proud warrior race and thus she created the lizard people - fierce fighters from the Wastelands.&lt;br&gt;The God Vrogir, renowned for his brutality and violence created the orcs and enslaved them for more than three hundred years before he left Rivellon. Xantezza, the Goddess of mirth and laughter, wanted an intelligent race, versed in the arts of magic around her. She created the imps, who were talented magicians and engineers. The Goddess Amadia was an outsider, preferring to live in complete solitude. As the centuries passed the six races spread over the continent. &lt;br&gt;One day Amadia&apos;s dalliance with a wizard resulted in the birth of several demi-gods. She granted her lover immortality and decided that she would act as the patron mother of the wizards. Although wizards are not considered as a separate race, they have always had their own goddess to pay tribute to.
I think I&apos;m going to vomit.
I&apos;m not even a healer - ours was killed in the attack. I&apos;m just the cook...
You think very highly of yourself indeed.
As long as you stay put, you&apos;ll be safe
Still here? This&apos;s the last place I&apos;d be if I still had air in my lungs.
*Thank him and turn away.*
I was in a place beyond place, where Zorl-Stissa and her compeers reside. You may know the result was Source; power: a blessing.
I love you too, I swear it! Together we will brave it all. Even... the king.

*Sallow Man smiles inside your head. A vision of an altar appears. He raises a long-nailed finger and points you back the way you came.*
*Tell her you&apos;re done here; it&apos;s time to move on.*
Do you want to keep these display settings?&lt;br&gt;Reverting in [1]...
Ah yes. I am the Doctor. Take careful note of my power, but allow me the secrets of my profession. Now, to the matter at hand. I offer you a pact of friendship and mutual co-operation.
What kind of Divine was he, as the Eternals took their place in the world?
*One last dial remains, with the same phrases as all the others.*
*The Magister lunges for the dwarf, his exasperation clear.*
[IFAN] *Tell her that life is more sacred than truth. She should have stayed silent.*
Pretty sure you already know how much I value &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.
*The bull chews its cud, ignoring your presence.*
*Tell Gareth you can&apos;t wait to get moving. What&apos;s the destination?*
*Gesture joyfully at the scene. It&apos;s good when a Magister gets what&apos;s coming to him.*
It may just be you. The One. You might be him!
Good answer. Keep your distance next time.
*Ask what&apos;s up with the whole &apos;evil toy&apos; act?*
Molten midnight, dark as an endless witching hour.
Brother in Tir-Cendelius. You must help. I can be freed.
I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll clobber &apos;im!
*The look on your face says you have to kill him now. And he knows it.*
Do not worry, the Source shall not be wasted. It will carry me from this tomb. It will bring me freedom at last.
And watch the wolf that saved you, the wolf that follows you so dutifully. The wildest animals often turn and bite the hand that feeds them.
Hrrmph. Think you&apos;re special or something? Too good for my verse? You&apos;re nothing but another lousy human!
*Agree - this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; quite perfect. The perfect reason to rend his skull from his neck.*
*Decide to see where this leads, despite your apprehension.*
I pledge my life, O Lucian, please return. And you, pilgrim, should do the same.

Character is tied up.
We&apos;re doomed.
And then I can return to finding my people. I cannot be the last Eternal, but the rest of them are somewhat... absent.
Male Lizard Dreamer
*Hours pass, sweet talk; sweet touches. She&apos;s asleep now in your arms. What do you do?*
Sebille learned that Roost Anlon may be holed up in an abandoned sawmill somewhere outside Driftwood.
*Answer &apos;The House of Knowledge&apos;.*
*Remark that this clarifies... very little. Demand an explanation.*
Some thuggish Sourcerer extortionists were threatening an innocent elf. We intervened.
We told the Magisters about the smuggled Source weapons. They asked for evidence implicating the dwarves.
Oh, &lt;i&gt;fine&lt;/i&gt;.
Who are you - who are you? You get out of here! Where are the guards? Guards! Help!
[JESTER] *Deadpan: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Well, we should be fine then.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*His eyes narrow, and when he speaks it&apos;s with a snarl.*
It&apos;s the Sourcerers&apos; fault for bringing this down on us. People like that bloody Meistr. Stringin&apos; them up is too good for that sort.
Effie&apos;s Notebook
*She twists the needle, making him squirm and scream.*
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;matter - you above all others. Even those you may love.
*You find a nice spot in the shade and close your eyes. When you wake from your nap you see Sadha and the Red Prince exiting the wagon, hand in hand.*
Well. That was fun. Could&apos;ve gone a few more rounds, myself.
Well-worn Chest
Your tree must wait. There is fighting in you yet.
Just look at you! A Source-slinging stranger if I ever I saw one! I&apos;m surprised those robed fellas ain&apos;t attacking you on sight!
Other
A very reasonable concern, I&apos;m afraid.
Scar? I  don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any Scar. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
&lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;I may have cracked the spell that will stop the Great Acorn in its furious tracks, if that&apos;s what you mean. That&apos;s right Quercus: &lt;i&gt;We&apos;ve done it!&lt;/i&gt;
What are you doing here? Do please excuse me, I&apos;m here to meet with someone else entirely.
Round Silver Necklace
Magister&apos;s Note
*A smile spreads across the spirit&apos;s face. Given the circumstances, it seems quite jocular.*
Pretty sure &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; get him in one go.
Sticky placed on different level: &quot;[1]&quot;
From [1] ability
Actually, I think I&apos;ll call his bluff.
Pray tell me - what&apos;s the darkest, most delicious nugget of knowledge you&apos;ve come across in your time...?
Respect? Try &lt;i&gt;rancour!&lt;/i&gt;
A boy swam out in search of Fort Joy and his mother. We found his leg in a shark&apos;s belly.
Flee the ship.
If you can douse the fire, good prince, sing these words.  The chest will open for you like a cracked egg.

*Give her a long, cool look. Then smile. Lean over and kiss her. It was worth it.*
[ELF] *Say that you appreciate that he tried to help your people.*
Your thanks are as hollow as your promises.
*Tell her to calm down; everything will be alright.*
There&apos;s a trap somewhere here. A trap that will lock all the doors at once.
&lt;i&gt;The House of Shadows&lt;/i&gt; stirs! The honourable Brahmos sensed them closing in. He had no choice but to flee from Driftwood.
But no, I apologise. I should use that word no longer. You are a free woman now, just like you said. I applaud your victory...
*Search the inscription for more clues.*

*Ask if he can teach you what he learned from Hannag.*
Sou... Source weapons?! What the hell are they doing there...? Be sure to tell Reimond, or Julian, as soon as possible!
*The spirit will not be ignored: its voice is a harsh whisper, gusting into you and around you like the winter wind.*
Vial Rack
*You can feel a subtle shift in the air and birdsong fills your ears. Reaching forward, you feel the cool stone of the altar and a new carving. You trace it with your hands: an image of the sun.*
*Shrug and take your leave.*

A devotee... &lt;i&gt;Forced&lt;/i&gt; to kneel. &lt;i&gt;Forced&lt;/i&gt; to worship.
*Delorus turns away from you.*
My feathers are moulting, my wings can&apos;t carry me anymore... I feel so cold. All I can think about is warmth...
*Turn away, you&apos;re not stealing Source from some poor stranger.*
Broken Musical Instrument
Yer back! What&apos;s on yer mind?
Not right now, I&apos;m afraid. Try again later.
This is how it is meant to be. How my father &lt;i&gt;intended &lt;/i&gt;it to be. Even here he guides me to my destiny.
You just bought yourself a ticket to a prison cell with that move.
Flee failed: enemies too close
Dwarf Civilian
I&apos;ve made my will known. Resist his call, I beg of you!
It is &lt;i&gt;She!&lt;/i&gt; The woman I&apos;ve dreamt of since birth! The secret of my soul. We met in Driftwood but she disappeared before we had a chance to talk.
*Lean close. Whisper. Tell him you like him. You &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;like him. You&apos;re trying to help him.*
Anything you need to get off your chest? You can whisper, I won&apos;t tell.
I know. Just be careful.

Although it&apos;s too hot to hold for long, crafting this arrowhead into a special arrow could bring just the right amount of heat to any battle.

Wither! This is my new friend. He&apos;s really smart. You&apos;ll like him a lot.
*Say it would probably be best to let it remain a one-time thing.*
*He takes this in. A single ghostly tear trickles down his face.*
Fane asked a blacksmith for a device to rip the faces off corpses. She angrily directed him to the dungeons and someone called &apos;Kniles&apos;.
Much the same as it is now. I&apos;ll be your advisor. Your helpmate. And in return, you&apos;ll ensure my survival in the new order of things... for make no mistake, a new order is coming.

Barracks Prison Chest
One of Lohar&apos;s, are you? &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; should know better than to stick your clumsy fat fingers in the Queen&apos;s secret operations.
I don&apos;t know what to make of it. Is that thing going to keep getting stronger?
What unseen wind douses the flames?
Let us move as Lucian&apos;s eyes and ears. Let us be his sword and his shield. Let us burn the darkness with holy fire!
*The prayer seems to echo in the hollow space inside you.*
Frightfully busy at the moment, love. Haven&apos;t got any liquor on hand, have you? This fellow could use a little comfort.
Ah, come on - let me enjoy it a little! I mean, I&apos;m... I&apos;m free. He can&apos;t hurt me anymore.
*You run your hands along the exterior until your fingers graze a button.*
