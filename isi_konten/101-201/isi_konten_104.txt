Lady Kemm has been kind enough to host me until I can return to the kingdom. She is a gracious host, even in these trying times - and has taught me much about tea...
Why&apos;d you just vanish like that? I was talking to you!
They will walk the same path as you, but they cannot be allowed to reach its end. You must be the one. Only one can wield the power to stop the Void. Only &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
But of course! First you must know that I am a prince, &lt;i&gt;the Red Prince.&lt;/i&gt;
A Demon Hunter. One of your party is under the influence of a rather nefarious guest. I pledged to help her.
Voices can&apos;t hurt us. Rally round, we&apos;ve strength in numbers.
*Shout in anger and grab your weapon. She will call off the attack. Now!*
*Decline, and walk away from the putrid cart.*
Good gods! There&apos;s... There&apos;s been a murder here.
Large Physical Armour Potion
AMULET EFFECT
...
*Take your leave.*
You&apos;re confused. You&apos;re conflicted. And all because...
Is that so? Well, you can tell your ancient emperor that lizard-tail soup is my specialty, and you look quite delicious. I&apos;ll save him a taste.
*Ryker ignores you, and continues his call. His voice grows even louder, until his words echo from every crevasse in the chamber.*
You can&apos;t afford me.
He is the Master of the House of Shadows. He is a terror that breathes. You know him simply as the Master, Sebille.
Edie Engrym&apos;s Source is gone. She and her spirit no longer exist.
*Tell him not to be too greedy. Quite frankly, you have need of all the Source you can get.*
*You bow to the spirit, muttering a blessing. Higba&apos;s spirit smiles as your favour washes over it, and it quietly drifts away to the Hall of Echoes.*
This place has seen better days...
Ben. If he finds his mum in Fort Joy they&apos;re probably both really happy now. So don&apos;t worry. Isn&apos;t that right, mister?
Broken Source Collar
*He unsheathes his weapon and scowls. There is no talking your way out of this.*
Well, it&apos;s been... &lt;i&gt;interesting.&lt;/i&gt;
Here you have it. A Sourcerer who no longer draws death and destruction to our realm. A Sourcerer cured of the terrible power that once consumed her. A Sourcerer healed.
A striking painting, truly - and featuring a familiar face.
Just so.
You need another teacher, then. I just pray the list you stole from the Magisters was long enough...
Dead... more dead...
*You gaze into the mirror, and you see a red lizard...*
[JESTER] *Give him a long, uncomfortable hug. While you&apos;re at it, steal his purse.*
Livewood Log
*The spirit contemplates you with a sultry bat of her eyelids.*
*The lizard commander notices; winks at you and licks his lips.*
*The elf&apos;s face freezes for just a second before he waves his hand dismissively.*
HEH! Nice try, ye dope.
Bring the Shadow Prince&apos;s dead heart to the Mother Tree.
*You close your eyes and the world around you disappears, but a new one takes its place. You&apos;re surrounded by rows of angular stone shelves, each one packed full of books.*
This small token is a promise of greater things to come. Bind the armour set together once more, and be rewarded.
*Agree to this favour, and ask what it is.*
*Say it was nothing, and ask what happened to him.*
Go on, then.
My mind? What else, kin? I&apos;m wondering why. All of this. Source. The Voidwoken. The Divine. Why?
I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;very good&lt;/i&gt; at what I do, see. I don&apos;t even need a Source Hound yapping at my side.
*Demand to know more about their plan.*
Here&apos;s what you do: You find Dallis. You take back the powers of the gods. And when you do, summon me. Together, we&apos;ll end it all in an instant.
Hidden Den
I mean, there is a certain justice to it. My people suffered for so long - they should be allowed to live again.
[1] froze and shattered into ice shards.
We&apos;re coming for you, Adramahlihk.
Got yourself together? Let&apos;s soulbond and see who&apos;s got a better handle on this... this reality of ours.
We asked Toyseller Sanders to help us get past the Path of Blood in the Cathedral. He gave us an amulet - we must fill it with Source.
Version
*Tell him not to worry. Losing is just not something you do.*
I&apos;m a little busy here and you&apos;re supposed to be helping. Could you get on with it, please?
Squirrel Wizard
[OUTLAW] *Say you&apos;ll take him up on his offer another time; for now, you&apos;ve got to go.*
*Say you don&apos;t believe in &apos;us&apos; and &apos;them&apos;.*
Surely you understand, my love. All I did, I did for our future. For the future of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; our kin.
Is that thing diseased...?
*Click* *Clack* *Click*
&lt;i&gt;Fool... now you will die...&lt;/i&gt;
In the spirit of loving generosity, he returned the ring to his now ex-wife.
*How this thing even moves, you do not know.*
*As he hums, the words come back to you. &apos;There&apos;s no smoke without fire, dark the air...&apos;*
The undead pirate guarding the chest is dead.
Pfft. Yeah, ok. Sure.
&lt;i&gt;Adramahlihk.&lt;/i&gt; You have to admire his cunning. To think that in his guise of Daeva he and I shared the finest wines in the realm; stories of the women we have loved.
[SCHOLAR] *Remark that her perception indicates an excellent education, and ask where she studied.*
I tried to warn them, but would they listen?
They&apos;re in the Void. The Seven threw them to the Void.
You... you released me... long have I waited for this moment...
One too few, actually.
Far in the horizon, we saw a large Magister warship. That looks like our way off this island, if we can seize it.
Teleport Gawin to the opposite ledge.
Allow me first to see your companions to safety.
*He watches you carefully, suspicion etched upon his face, one hand on his weapon, ready to draw.*
*Agree. You do, really.*
*Assure him that Sourcerers are not the ones to blame for the Voidwoken.*
Few desire the responsibility of Divinity. But I shall persist - for the good of the world.
Reaper&apos;s Coast prospered.
Don&apos;t fight it... let go... rest, at last...
* [1] points due to [2]
My thanks, stranger...
*A lazy red once more. A desert camp at sunset. Amid the carpets and perfumed waters stands a lizard Dreamer dressed in royal silks.*
Life is for the living, darling.
I long for... life. True life...
[SCHOLAR] *Say there must be strong magic at play here.*
*Inform the voice that there&apos;s a flaw in its plan: it didn&apos;t account for you.*
A Godwoken. A murderer. A monster.
Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I just spotted some seaweed with more common sense than your good self, and I do so appreciate &lt;i&gt;intelligent&lt;/i&gt; conversation.
See if the Magisters have caught the fugitive Higba.
A demon hunter who makes evildoers tremble, Jahan&apos;s purpose in life is to burn the forces of darkness from the land.
*His breaths are loud and fast, like a charging bull&apos;s.*
No news here. Everyone wants a piece of &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
May Lucian&apos;s spirit accompany you on the road!
Accept
Leave a wound alone and it&apos;ll patch &lt;i&gt;itself &lt;/i&gt;right up. Longer it takes, the less likely you&apos;ll let it happen again.
Herb is grown!
Good answer. Now let&apos;s take a look.
*Whispers...* This is not the first time you deal with elven flesh, Lone Wolf.
Let&apos;s find a way to get this bucket moving, and fast... the quicker we get away from this island, the better.
I don&apos;t know. Something powerful. We thought it might help, but...
Once I&apos;ve talked to Griff.
*Point to the ground. He must kneel in the presence of the new Divine.*
Free Amyro.
Grants the user an additional Attribute Point.
Stand down, Magister Roe. This one is... &lt;i&gt;an old acquaintance&lt;/i&gt;, shall we say. Let him approach.
*The creature suddenly holds itself around the ears, as though seized by a great pain. Several flapping jaws open and close over a single, many-fanged maw, like a taxidermist&apos;s experiment.*
Darling, you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;undead?! &lt;/i&gt;Be still my beating heart! No offence.
*As you step closer, your nose is filled with Ifan&apos;s intoxicating animal scent. He reaches out and catches your wrist in one rough hand. As his warm skin brushes yours, Source sparks between you.*
*Say you want your personal effects. The ones his people stole from you in the tavern.*
*He takes a step towards you.*
*He dips a spoon into the bowl and lifts it to his lips, anticipation apparent on his face.*
*Bow your head. You should have done more.*
Shall I take you to the island?
*Say that Dorian has disappeared. Does he know where you might find him?*
Champion of Fort Joy! Spreadin&apos; yer name far and wide!
A wise philosophy - one should always embrace the opportunities that present themselves.
I do try to be nice about it and all that, but this bridge &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;Marg&apos;s business.
Migo&apos;s Ring
*The squirrel looks around the boat, chittering excitedly. At least he sounds happy...*
*Shrug and say that perhaps it was natural causes.*
*Wave away her questions and cough that searing green smoke out of your system.*
Someone causes a lot of damage around here. I suspect you know something of it.
*Let them eat.*
Deal with Alexandar.
I&apos;m glad we left when we did. I&apos;ve never seen such a terrible place.
The Knights of Drey will never find us here. A perfect sanctuary to pause and complete our research.
[MYSTIC] *Say his mind seems awfully far away. Where has it gone?*
You! The Advocate has been waiting.
*Ask what happens if you aren&apos;t &lt;i&gt;quite &lt;/i&gt;pure enough. There must be a safeguard, surely?*
It&apos;s Duggan, it is. Oh, and this here&apos;s Leya. You gotta be sick of that collar. Leya, you can get him fixed up, yeah?
*Ifan raises an eyebrow. He looks at you, long and slow. The shadow of a smile tugs at the edges of his wine-dark lips.*
*He turns his attentions to Beast himself, whose face looks oddly blank, given his usual rambunctious demeanour.*
Bird Desert 04
*Jangle your coin purse and wink.*
*Sobs rack his body.*
Oho! Like that, I &lt;i&gt;like.&lt;/i&gt; Head on in, little lady... I&apos;ll see &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; after last orders.
No... it must be the God King to claim me! How is it youuUUUUUURGH...
They&apos;re at the back door now! To arms!
Sourcerer&apos;s Ring
Reckon the Paladins are gonna pay for this? They look good and all in their shiny armour, but it takes a Magister to run the city.
*The lizard hisses dismissively.*
*You hear the sound of fluttering wings... but no bird appears. The sound dies away.*
Level Lock
You are under arrest, thief! Looks like you have some prison time ahead of you.
You dare pick pockets? You pay for that!
*After all that&apos;s just happened, life - or what passes for it - seems more precious to you than ever.*
When is she coming back?
*Say you can guess what happens next.*
Time to open the eyes... you lost so long ago...
*Demand she tell you what&apos;s going on here.*
I can think of worse ways to go.
Cave Entrance
Keep mum about it. That&apos;s the best way I can think of.
*Smiles.* Now perhaps you&apos;d like to return outside and consort with those who have... &lt;i&gt;intellectual stamina &lt;/i&gt;more on par with your own, yes? I am quite busy here.
[VILLAIN] *Say that you&apos;re here to kill Sourcerers. It&apos;s your favourite sport.*
Now the rules have... relaxed somewhat. Slaves have simply become a commodity; a given. They come from all walks of life from all over Rivellon.
Lay one finger on this meat and I&apos;ll bite it off - don&apos;t think I can&apos;t; I&apos;ve had plenty of practice chewing through your kind!
*Decide that magic-users are who you need the most right now. Anyone who can heal.*
