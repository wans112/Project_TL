Tovah told us that Saheila is a Scion: she carries the memories of all the ancestor trees. If the trees die, Saheila will take root.
*Say you want to enter the Devourer&apos;s dream.*
We convinced the bird to let us help it.
*Ask who Qanna is.*
*Tell him you want his &lt;i&gt;life.*&lt;/i&gt;
No, wait. We cannot face the trial of divinity yet! The Master is on this island, he &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;die before we go any further.
&lt;i&gt;Voidwoken &lt;/i&gt;at a wedding. It&apos;s too ghastly to contemplate, and yet it happened right here. My poor darling girl...
Healing Crystal
&lt;i&gt;...Godwoken...&lt;/i&gt;
Look, chief. I&apos;ve had a long, short life. And one thing I figured out is... when it&apos;s right, it&apos;s right. And what we had was... mm. &lt;i&gt;Correct.&lt;/i&gt;
You can&apos;t delete the current scene
*It suddenly dawns on you that you&apos;ve made a terrible mistake.*
The Lunar Gate
House Interior - Attic B
Help the little girl.
You&apos;ve got an ally in me.
Don&apos;t get nosey, salamander. That forked tongue will get you in trouble.
*Ask him to tell you more about this Mordus.*
It&apos;s so very much... &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt;, for me.
*Say you&apos;d like to ask some further questions.*
*Resist the God King. You will not do his bidding!*
*The spirit of a young Sourcerer stands before you.*
*BBBZZZZTT!* Please. Leave me. I mean no harm. Not anymore.
*Take your leave.*
You just keep your weapon pointed away from me, and I dare say this might all actually turn out alright. Alright?
*Wonder why he&apos;s clutching his hand like that.*
*Ask what she just did to you.*
My child. You and you alone must rise above the reach of minor people.
*Kneel before the altar, whispering a quiet prayer to your god. Perhaps here, in his own temple, you&apos;ll be able to talk to him.*
I have something for you! Something I buried. Behind the coop! It&apos;s yours! It&apos;s yours!
*The spirit laughs - a terrible, cynical guffaw that says that the world is an evil place, where no-one is safe. But inside the laughter there&apos;s shame - the Magister knows that he sinned, and suspects that his death was deserved.*
Move into the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;cone&lt;/font&gt; behind an enemy and attack while wielding a dagger to perform a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;backstab&lt;/font&gt;. Successful backstabs perform instant critical hits!
*Rue that people have worries of their own.*
*Murmurs...* Hey! That tickles...
We come here to get her back. To bring her home. She is everything to me; she is everything to us.
*Feeling you reciprocate, the Red Prince kisses you passionately.*
*The graveyard. You look down at your mangled hand, then towards a shimmering spirit standing ahead. A feast awaits.*
*Tell him to call off the search - the chef is to blame, not the tinkerer!*
*Say you are no stranger to pleasurable eruptions. And you prefer them shared.*
Remember me to the Empire, if you ever make it home.
*He turns white, like he&apos;s seen a ghost. Or a &lt;i&gt;monster.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Change your mind and say you&apos;ll play with him after all.*

Lucian&apos;s great city faded from the world.

Reimond: I have received my final report from agents in Arx. Our enemies are many, but my primary concerns are with the individuals that know how to access the Crypt of Lucian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of these individuals is obvious: the crypt&apos;s keeper, Lord Arhu. I know Arhu is under your surveil; see that you increase your efforts, and report any unusual activities to me. He must not interfere with the Grand Design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have done well. I trust in your continued loyalty.
Not going to happen. I have... Wait. Oh no.
[SCHOLAR] *Point out a partially healed circular wound upon the woman&apos;s scalp - a &lt;i&gt;trepanation wound&lt;/i&gt;. Someone opened her head and tinkered around, it seems.*
*The freshly dead flesh sits heavily in her hands. She looks at it  with confusion, as if it were an alien relic fallen from the sky - inexplicable. Her face hardens.*
Injured Seekers
*Say you knew him to take tremendous pleasure out of hurting the prisoners sent to him.*
[NOBLE] *Explain that you come from a family of excellent breeding.*
It&apos;s not every day you fall in love with a future god, after all.
*Remark that for an all-powerful Godwoken she&apos;s looking mighty powerless right now.*
*Tell him it&apos;s just a feeling, and that you hope you&apos;re wrong, for everyone&apos;s sake.*
*The fiery slime creature looms imperiously over you, and utters a questioning gurgle.*
[The slip from a carrier owl is from a Magister in Arx. He seems to be suspicious of the Paladins and requests reinforcements from Reimond. He warns &apos;Kemm suspects something.&apos;]
*Ask if he&apos;s seen Arhu around here lately.*
The Seeker is a brave soul, but he lacks subtlety. If he were to search for the dungeon, he may lead the Magisters straight to it. And-... there are items in there which &lt;i&gt;cannot &lt;/i&gt;fall into their hands.
No, please. I beg you. Let me out!
Lohse! Bless the sight of you... The demon, Adramahlihk... Too powerful... Possessed...
*Stall for time. Admit to Jonathan that he&apos;s right. Gareth&apos;s morality makes him weak.*
How can you be so sentimental to your own detriment? Or worse - to mine!
Dwarven Traveller
Sourcerer. This island is nothing but death - you should leave.
I suppose I&apos;m the lone survivor...
*Your stomach wraps itself in knots. You ask her to tell you.*
Tch tch! Tch tch!
*Remark that memory loss is very convenient. There must be more.*
*Say you&apos;ve never known a ship to speak in the first place.*
*You hear that voice in your mind, demanding that you give it control - demanding your body obey its will.*
Snakestail
I... I did, didn&apos;t I? I admit I never would have thought that one day I&apos;d participate in a fight that pitted a lizard noble against a slave, only to side with the slave.
*Sing about the pair rowing to the middle of the sea and embracing as their boats pass each other at sunset.*
Yes. And let&apos;s hope they haven&apos;t become a snack in the meantime...
*Ask him to elaborate.*
*Say you won&apos;t stand for this. There must be a way to save her still!*
I am the living and the dead... I am air and water... I am blood and thunder...
Aoife, darling,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I shouldn&apos;t write to you like this, to the office of your profession, but I just can&apos;t help myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those evenings in the Owlery with you were the greatest of my life, and now that I&apos;m back at camp with nothing but Paladins for company, I dream of them every night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe, maybe when all this is over, there will be a time for us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Write me back, please, that I may know I&apos;m not alone in this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hardwin
*Retreat from the truth and say you can&apos;t be certain.*
Years later he was undone by a scandal involving three prominent envoys from the Ancient Empire
And what kind of Divine was the Red Prince, as the world battled on?
I won&apos;t deny I have had my... less-than-dignified moments. You just... you&apos;re difficult, Lohse. You know that. You push people to the edge and then you&apos;re surprised when they get desperate.
Lose your weapons, or it is not good for you.
*Lean down and give the dog your friendliest smile. Tell him you couldn&apos;t lie to such a good li&apos;l doggie.*
If you come back bleeding, don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you.
I cling now to the dream that one day the Veil will be sealed.
Oi! You&apos;re very much back!
*One step. Then another. Even closer. You&apos;ve never felt so ready to kill, so on the brink of impending action. You&apos;re like a cat, all concentrated muscle, that split second before it pounces.*
Spear
You can demand until we&apos;re both dust - that&apos;s the only answer I have to give.
You expect me to swallow that? Let&apos;s go - there&apos;s a stone bed waiting for you in the barracks.
Move along there, citizen.
*HRRRR!*
An Unlikely Patron
Yeah. S&apos;pose you&apos;ll do what yer gonna do.

*The statue gestures toward the heavens, a striking image amidst the graves and sepulchres.*
*And now, now &lt;i&gt;it is above you! &lt;/i&gt;- but your eyes find only nothingness, the closest to Void you have ever come.*
*Tell her that you found a wrecked caravan outside the town.*
&apos;ey up, partner. Though I reckon I should fill you in on a few things.
I never thought I would be proud to have befriended a giant, but there is no one I-
*Tell him you will walk freely here.*
Bless his heart. Please, do send word to him; he can rest his mind now. Micheil is no man of courage, but he&apos;s as loyal as a fresh-fed pup.
Do we return now? To the others? My people wait for me nearby.
A dwarf out of his kingdom, yes, like a fish out of water, dangling helplessly from a hook.
Wouldn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;like to know.
No telling what&apos;ll happen after all this, though. I mean... I&apos;m open if &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;are.
*You turn to move, yet the bloom&apos;s scent ribbons towards you until it fills your nostrils. Your whole body flushes. You&apos;re sure you must be glowing, so deep does the warmth dwell.*
But if you&apos;re about done with the lecture, let&apos;s keep moving.
How I have missed the unliving! So old, yet so focused on things of no consequence. It has been too long.
*Cast your gaze at the decimated forests beyond. Say you are sorry it had to watch its brothers and sisters felled.*
Inventory
And I&apos;ll bet you they&apos;re all superfluous in the end.
It&apos;s no use. The evil is strong in her. Her words are soaked in it. They squirm into your mind, planting warm memories you&apos;ve never had, mesmerising you with sounds and scents that were never there.
As is written in the Royal Guard Field Manual, Volume 7, &apos;Sometimes life is just one bloody thing after another, isn&apos;t it?&apos;
[JESTER] *Tell the kid you&apos;re sure Justinia will have things sorted out... &lt;i&gt;shortly.&lt;/i&gt; Then ask what else is going on.*
*Ask Kemm what this Paladin is accused of.*
If we&apos;re meant to survive, we&apos;d best move off the shore. No telling if they followed us here.
We have departed from Reaper&apos;s Coast, without exploring this matter any further.

*Tell him to stop interrupting. Make like the dog and listen.*
&apos;Stonegarden&apos;
I &lt;i&gt;hunger&lt;/i&gt; for you, Lohse. There&apos;s no stopping me now.
*Like a cold draught in a crypt Prudence&apos;s terror returns. Now it&apos;s a fear of the dark and the cold. A fear of the grave. A fear of her own death.*
*Press your bandaged hand to her forehead. Is she alright?*

My little helpers do what they can to keep my inventory full up. And speaking of full up, you are surely peckish. What is your delight?
Griff &apos;n&apos; his lads won&apos;t know what hit &apos;em...
*You are running, running, running through a barren landscape. Brambles and weeds scratch at your ankles. Your heart is pumping acid, but you can&apos;t stop...*
Hush - do not interrupt.
*Mention that you gave him your thoughts, yes.*
You will die. You will all die.
