My, look at the concentration on your face! All &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;, but no &lt;i&gt;result&lt;/i&gt;.
*Say you&apos;d like to do some trading, if possible.*
The silent bastards burn well, &apos;tis true.
Anyway. Enough chit-chat. I&apos;ve got a contract to be fulfilling. The same Godwoken contract &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; couldn&apos;t hack.
A stern warning to patrols from Magister Siwan.
If you know a way, I&apos;d be... beyond grateful.
*The fish instantly churns your insides, blinds you to your surroundings... but then, a vision... towering horrors... the Voidwoken... gathered before a &lt;i&gt;silhouetted figure&lt;/i&gt;... you strain to see who it is...*
To make a point, for it is murder they would commit, and it would be murder that would be committed upon them.
You have an ever so curious definition of happiness.
Farsight Infusion Scroll
Yeah? I&apos;d get used to it, if I were you. Nobody&apos;ll be sucking your fingers clean round here.
Tenebrium Ore
Decide your fate - and that of the whole world.
*Say that what&apos;s happening on Rivellon right now is bigger than any contract.*
[RED PRINCE] *Demand to know where the Dreamer who&apos;s conjuring this nightmare is located. Does he hold the princess?*
CAWKAWRICKAW!
Fingal Boyd
*Power, she says. Ask her to tell you more.*
But do not fear, we will find her. And I promise you: if she is involved in this Black Ring conspiracy, she will suffer justice.
Mug of Tea
That would be prudent if I wanted to stay alive. Or whatever it is that I am now.
At first, there was no sign of Dallis in Lucian&apos;s tomb. Had we beaten her there? Or were we too late?
Amazing, what forces I command with the power of our pact, yes?
To get to Justinia we must go to Micheil Ros&apos; basement, then use Lulabelle&apos;s wine to enter the sewers. A secret door lies somewhere beyond.
*You wake, and all is warm and smooth and just-as-it-should-be. The Red Prince&apos;s hands still glide along your every curve.*
*Press the issue. She &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;know how to manipulate them, though...*
Durability
May Lucian return indeed.
I dunno about &apos;home&apos;, but I do sort of miss the gang I&apos;d travel with now and then. Kroller, Madcap... Papa Joris, for sure. Musicians, mostly. We all had our own stories, our own troubles, but when we were together and the music was with us, it was like none of that mattered at all.
*Explain that you disagree - it&apos;s quite natural for groups to compete.*
Alright, that&apos;s two Seekers to fight alongside you - I can&apos;t spare any more. Are you ready to start the attack?
*Murmur through chattering teeth this doesn&apos;t feel right. You don&apos;t want this hunger.*
*Change the subject.*
Unf! &lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
A bow that looks as though it were carved from solidified shadow. Cold to the touch, it envelops you in misty shade when used.
*He catches your hand and gives it a gentle squeeze, winking at you as he lets go.*
*Wonder why they were looking for weapons here.*
Skill is in cooldown
Locked Door
*Tell him to slow down. You did what was asked of you; now you want the information he promised.*
These g-RIBBIT-guys&apos;ll shoot you through if you get too close! I&apos;m gonna try and slip through the back way, myself. I like a ch-RIBBIT-allenge!
It&apos;s hard to explain. I never knew how every gesture, every moment, every &lt;i&gt;life &lt;/i&gt;could be meaningful.
P-please, ask - whatever helps.
I see you gallivanting around. And now it&apos;s time to gallivant your way out of here.
Oft-used Paladin Shield
We been ridin&apos; together, the three of us, must be ten years now. After what happened in the caves... well, I ain&apos;t abandonin&apos; any more of mine to no kind of fate &apos;cept the one they would&apos;a wanted.
Key of the One
Musclebuster
*You&apos;re here to help yourself. Tell him to shut up and get naked.*
*Tell him he looks like a bag of sick puppies on the way to the river.*
Says &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
The Beast returned home as leader.
They flayed us, killed us, and then brought us back. The magic of the Soul Jars bind us here.
*He looks toward the graveyard.*
*Bow to the Divine.*
Ergo, the Seekers sent you here. There is no other place they would send someone important enough to carry that mask.
All of a sudden, a &lt;i&gt;tiger&lt;/i&gt; prowls in. I jump up, but everybody else is just ignoring it. And then he picks up my scent! His eyes turn blue and he leaps to pounce on me - a fury of claws and teeth.
An audience is granted; I am yet too intrigued to give my leave. Now tell me, Isbeil: Why do you allow this sulking figure before me?
Shut it, longbow.
We fight them off and they keep coming, bigger than before. We can&apos;t hold out forever.
Challenger
*Tell her you&apos;ll consider it - if her story&apos;s interesting enough.*
You carry it off very well, by the by. But ol&apos; Beast&apos;s been around the block and there&apos;s no foolin&apos; him.
*Leya smiles and gives you a shy wave as you walk away.*
Magisterâ€™s Research Log
*The candles is extinguished. The spirit is gone.*
We never found the Deathfog. The fate of Arx is sealed.
Move along. Despite what they say, misery don&apos;t love company.
*The spirit ignores your presence, busy as it is resisting the pull of another - the ancestor tree, trying to take its Source. All you feel is the spirit&apos;s resistance... and its anger, directed at the Mother Tree that has betrayed it.*
*If the Lady Vengeance could take him anywhere, ask where he&apos;d go.*
*Remark that the Paladins are far from home.*
*Fold your arms across your chest and give them a steady stare.*
*Say you&apos;re here to find a certain Magister dressed all in white. Ask if she&apos;s seen anyone fitting that description.*
We told Almira that we&apos;d already given the tablet to someone else.
You people don&apos;t deserve me. And neither do those weirdos in the cellar. Miaow, etc.
*Mention the dippy priest. Does she do any work for her?*
*Ponder the Swornbreaker in your pack. Through it, she may be freed.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll be back with three limbs.*
Encryption Decoder
Indeed there is. To save us &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt;, as a matter of fact.
Dallis took a... particular interest in me, and my skills. I&apos;m an expert in healing, crafting, and, eh, more &lt;i&gt;arcane &lt;/i&gt;practices...
Under any other circumstance that action would have quite enraged me beyond measure, but as it stands I suppose I&apos;ll just have to have a chat with your former Master&apos;s spirit.
HAIL TO THY GRACE UPON THY RETURN... &lt;i&gt;MY MAKER.&lt;/i&gt;
Back so soon?
Done shopping, then?
He&apos;s not mad, Conway! Look at him. Looks like he&apos;s our best shot of gettin&apos; the farm back.
*She smiles, then quietly gestures a very rude sign with her hand.*
*Make them pay for their disgusting show of force.*
By Amadia&apos;s grace, what did you do?!
*The beast emits a sharp growl. It lowers its head, angling its beak into a cruel smile.*
*Shrug and say it doesn&apos;t sound any worse than dying in the swamps.*
The Goddess Amadia. I never would have imagined we would be quite so... close.
There is no rebirth, dear one. Too much has been lost. Go from here. Protect yourself. Protect your life. One never knows how little of it might remain.
*Smile. It sounds like true love.*
Stand back, and keep your hands off your weapons! Convince me you&apos;re no Magister, or draw one last, deep breath!
The pain is great, but my senses aren&apos;t gone... not yet...
Buddy
Talk, you traitor!
Where did I go wrong.
I need not wonder. The Empire abides, &lt;i&gt;never &lt;/i&gt;straying from its course. It is eternal as we.
With my research on the Veil, the Seven stole my people&apos;s Source and went to war with the King. Aetera failed to defeat them. The Seven cast the King and the Eternals into the Void. Aetera blames me.
*Examine the plant.*
Didn&apos;t have hounds on &apos;em, did they? I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;ve got no choice.
Action Menu
Be wary. Only a fool trusts a gift from the dead.
Well that&apos;s one more problem dealt with. Arx will be thriving again in no time, now that we&apos;re free of vermin.
Move Mouse Left
*Ask what happened here.*
Stone From The Sun
*Tell the girl that you&apos;re going to help her resist the demon.*
*Alexandar&apos;s eyes grow wide, and he shields himself with his luxurious cloak. Paladins and Magisters alike descend upon the bishop to shield him; you whip around to see both Gareth and Siva, eyes wide as saucers.*
Let&apos;s have a look, then.
*State that our individual freedoms are limited only by physical limitations. We are free to act within a defined set of rules.*
*Allow yourself to feel... wolven. See yourself a sellsword, fighting and killing for money.*
&lt;br&gt;A R E&lt;br&gt;Y O U&lt;br&gt;S W O R N ?
*Decline and take your leave.*
Spirit of Leya
He&apos;s looking for some doohickey called the Aeteran. Supposedly sucks all the Source out of anyone and anything... for good! Don&apos;t know what it looks like, only that I never found it. Not before... well, you can see for yourself what state I&apos;m in. All I ever saw were glowing gems and baubles.
*Give her Roost&apos;s hand from your pack.*
It was you?! Someone, help!
*Tell her you understand. You want to stand alongside her, with her as the chosen to ascend.*
HehehehEHEHE! The Doctor&apos;s plan! Hide in wedding cake. When dessert time came - GO BOOM! GOODBYE, ISBEIL! HeheheheHE!
We rescued Gwydian from the Magisters.
&apos;The priest has scryed the demon&apos;s lies.&apos;
Wouldn&apos;t cut butter, this one.
*Tell him she fled to Kemm&apos;s mansion.*
*Cry out for her to stop.*
Mystical Large Masterwork Rune
There is too much stone, I feel.
A large-sized potion that fortifies your constitution by scrubbing your insides from top to bottom.
*Say that you discovered that the Seven Gods are charlatans, and all mortals are little more than Source vessels to be consumed by them.*
*Say you&apos;ll see when the time comes.*
*Look for the face of the Red Princess.*
*Smile and pull her close. Make love to her.*
*Tell them he must do the right thing, then. He must help them die.*
He&apos;s still looking.
*Ask Fane about the architecture, is this all Eternal?*
Iron Lever
In the treasury was an odd-looking key - useful if we find an odd-looking lock.
I. Did not. Understand. Do you. Want. A buffalo?
Select &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Item&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Skill&lt;/font&gt; list and press [IE_Interact]. Pick the skill or item you want to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/font&gt; to this slot.
*Pretending to pat the man&apos;s head, you wipe your finger in what&apos;s left of his hair.*
&lt;i&gt;You.&lt;/i&gt;
Tooltips
*Tell him you still can&apos;t hear anything.*
[VILLAIN] *Whisper in his ear - tell him that &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;is ruined; the island stole his name, his mind, his very soul.*
Ah, you seek a more subtle approach? How surprisingly civilized. Very well, what do you require?
No more treats from Kemm? No more TASTY TREATS?
*Wonder who is responsible then.*
*The spirit is silent, but her face is not. A plethora of emotions cross it, as if she relives a lifetime of memories in this single moment.*
A fellow so sly-looking one immediately wonders where he got the coin to pay the artist.
Not to mention his son Alexandar - long may &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; rot. You saw him in action. Driven by fear, he took his father&apos;s power and used it to turn innocent Sourcerers to Silent Monks in Fort Joy.
*Lay your hand on the surface of the jar.*
*Keep on listening.*
*Ask about this Ryker. He sounds like someone to steer clear of.*
Handsome bastard though.
Perhaps... perhaps death heeds not the call of the free. Although, &lt;i&gt;*he squints at you*&lt;/i&gt; you look not unfettered yourself.
