Look alive; there will be more where this came from.
You were warned!
No. I told you they met their match in me.
Not jus&apos; then, though, but before. The Order&apos;s got Justinia&apos;s back. Always have. When you went against her, you went against them. You got the guts, is all I&apos;m sayin&apos;. Least someone does.
Temporal Manipulator
You&apos;re not with Lohar?
Godwoken...? Parasites, rather.
Tomato Soup
Rusty Twohander
Piercer
The archeologist spent months digging for my bones, following his Empress&apos; orders. We dreamed of unification.
Player [1] has signed out.
Healing Gem
Aren&apos;t you &lt;i&gt;listening?! &lt;/i&gt;The Well is a pool of pure Source in which the powers of the Seven lie united.
Wizard&apos;s Mask
I don&apos;t doubt that fortunes wax and wane, but the Empire remains unchanging.
*Your hand brushes against the skeleton&apos;s porous bones, and it convulses. Your Source begins to drain into the beast...*
*Admit that yes, you are an elf.*
Indeed? Tell me then. Do you not like roses? Can you not revel in their sweet scent?
Just this once.
*Wave his question away. You just have special skills, that&apos;s all.*
Add To Hotbar
*Apologise to the dwarf: you didn&apos;t want to cause any tension.*
Because that little snob thinks me unworthy of being in his precious lord&apos;s mansion appraising his precious lord&apos;s collection of antiques.
Again? Seriously?!
[VILLAIN] *Laugh. How wonderful, because you desire his helm. And his head with it. Attack!*
Let&apos;s forget for a moment all the forces that drove us here, shall we? Let us think of nothing but ourselves, one amid a nest of satin.
*Curl your lip and say he should keep his prejudices to himself.*
I had it all. And frankly, I got bored.
Animators Reference: 2HS WeaponSet
*No matter how loud Ifan shouts his questions, there is no response from the unconscious Alexandar. He reaches his arm back and you realise he intends to punch Alexandar in the face.*
You think you can just pay me off?
Dead Elf
*Lay your hand on his arm. Is he okay?*
*Shaking your head clear, ask him if he&apos;s ready for what lies ahead.*
*Take your leave.*
Stand back, kinswoman, and keep your hands off your weapons! Convince me you&apos;re no Magister, or draw one last, deep breath!
*She looks at you. She looks at your hand. She looks back at you. Either the human is an imbecile or that&apos;s not the correct response...*
Exter&apos;s shield is called Knaap.
Shh! It takes you again. Now is not the time. When you are ready. You are ready another day.
Dark Whisperer
&lt;i&gt;History&lt;/i&gt;&apos;ll remember you Reds with more venom than even t&apos;Black Ring!
*She looks at you from stern to bow and frowns, deep lines etching into her face.*
Now go.
*What remains of the outraged soul molds itself into a defiant skull, glowering at you before it vanishes.*
My parents were murdered by the man I once called friend.
Dune
CONGRATULATIONS!
Really?! Well, that changes matters. How can I help a friend of my dear Lyn and Conway?
Talk to the loremaster. I&apos;ve got my orders.
Dallis warned the Magisters against the Seekers, dissidents who are helping Sourcerers escape.
Gaudy Key
*Tell her what happened.*
Damnation - must you cause a fuss? Very well, let us see what the guards think. I doubt they will side with someone of your &lt;i&gt;height&lt;/i&gt;.
*He bows deeply, as reverently as one would before a god.*
&apos;Here lies a loyal man who wished to remain anonymous.&apos;
Gods, but I&apos;d love to be safe inside the city walls.
And what might that be, oh blessed child?
*Tell her she needs to let you know if she&apos;s going to lose control.*
Hello?
*Proclaim your support for the Divine Order: long may Dallis triumph!*
Events like today&apos;s do have a way of putting things in perspective.
Oh, beautiful. You really don&apos;t get it, do you?
They fed me to their young. &lt;i&gt;They fed me to their young!&lt;/i&gt;
They are &apos;Godwoken&apos;, the chosen champions of the other six Gods.
Be... wary. The urns will shatter. The bones will... rise.
Bless their allies with the courage to do what is right.
Galvanised
Piss off and stop wasting my time.
Most Dangerous When Cornered
*The guard rummages about in your bag, opening each pocket and checking every corner.*
*Assume a persona: Say your name is Magister... Groate.*
Barnes died in an accident -
The Shadow Prince&apos;s Notes
Honour Guard
*Tell him you&apos;ll consider it, but you want to ask him something else first.*
*The thugs retreat, each one shuffling backwards with eyes pinned to you the whole time. Zharat suddenly looks terrified, not scared of them but scared of &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Ifan. You look so tired. So careworn. Come, rest. Leave the past to worry over itself.
Crispin
*It floods your body with light at once boiling hot and freezing cold. You feel his hands upon you, and you move together, entwined in spirit and in flesh, as one...*
You won&apos;t find nothin&apos;. Money&apos;s hidden on the beach, by the water. *Yawn.*
Forgive me, darling.
The God King himself...
*Curtsey and say the honour is yours.*
Magical Stone Wand
The &apos;Hands of the Tyrant&apos; have a strange, pestilential aura.
Short Gloves
*Hold up your hand; you&apos;ve heard enough.*
The more I learn about Lucian, the more I realise I never truly knew the man...
Overpower

Explosions
*Bat the crossbow away; say you&apos;ve no time to play.*
*Nod. If he keeps his word you&apos;ll keep yours.*
Well now, aren&apos;t you a curious sight? If I&apos;d had a mask to hide my bones as well as yours, maybe I&apos;d still be walking around today.
That&apos;s the spirit!
*Sing Lawre Godfray&apos;s song: &lt;i&gt;&apos;I shall not mourn &apos;til war is done... I shall not weep while blood still runs...&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
What I did had to be done, Sebille. And I had to be the orchestrator, for I am the House of Shadows. I am the fate-weaver. I am the hand that guides a blind world. Even yours, Red Prince.
Did you accept your new status with humility, or did you rebel?
Which is what killed the cat, remember?
Is that so? Then are you not of woman born?
Whereas we both know I wipe my feet on you.
*A great pounding suddenly erupts in your chest. Your inner god roars and bellows - an incoherent, maddening cacophony.*
&lt;br&gt;From [1]: Start AP equal to Maximum AP.
Not to mention the time I got involved with a nasty piece of work named Kniles. The less said about &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; the better!
This blackened old key smells like hastily-cleansed stone and drying blood.
I am in &lt;i&gt;intense &lt;/i&gt;pain. You are either insufferably cruel or insufferably stupid.
I do not bargain with the likes of &lt;i&gt;you!&lt;/i&gt;
Because he is Lovrik.
Back again, eh?
Godw&lt;i&gt;uuuzziik&lt;/i&gt;ken. I am the Seneschal. I am here to serve.
Good indeed...
In the right hands, power is a tool to change the world. In the wrong, it is a tragedy waiting to happen.
Ritual Table
The spirits trapped in the Devourer&apos;s armour are now free. They left for eternal rest in the Hall of Echoes.
Set Canvas
You&apos;ve blessed them and cursed them with a single choice. You didn&apos;t reveal your altruism. You revealed your greed.
There are as many ideas in the world as grains of sand on the beach, but I think you will find this one especially intriguing.
Huh. You can... &lt;i&gt;talk &lt;/i&gt;to &apos;em?
Be quick about it, before that Magister realises their prize catch is about to slip through the net.
&lt;i&gt;You think to cling within your shell? Very well - I have tasted it now.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her it is growing, but you can still control it.*
Into the dark with you.
Without something more powerful than the sticks the Seekers are armed with, those crucified monstrosities will kill them to a man.
Please don&apos;t do this.
*Observe that perhaps if she were able to do more to help them they would accept her?*
A herbal mixture that should grant enlightenment to one who smokes it.
I&apos;ve heard worse.
It is not wrong to walk in the camp. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; wrong to assault one walking. You walk among the humans too long if you think differently.
All of this, Quercus. All of our struggle to save their stupid bloody giant races and this fool lets this &apos;God King&apos; enslave the world!
You leave her be! Can&apos;t yeh see she&apos;s not well?
*You look into her eyes and see screams. You hear her gaze upon your body and taste her carnal, violent lust - metallic and sharp as a blade in your mouth.*
*Ask him for your pay.*
Cracker
[HERO] *Remind him that his comrade is wounded. Time is of the essence, if you&apos;re going to try and help him.*
It&apos;s not the bloodshed that feels good - it&apos;s the not dying.
That is what they said, wasn&apos;t it? He who rises from the sheets with demons, must &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a demon.
I&apos;ll be back for you. You better hope I find that crate first.
What will Dallis bring us next? Truly remarkable.
*The spirit remains calm, as if he knew what was coming - and perhaps he did.*
Cherry Blossom Pink
Step carefully, stranger, and do as the Divine Order tells you - Paladin and Magister alike serve Alexandar here, and so should you.
They didn&apos;t put up much of a fight - dry land mustn&apos;t suit them.
Forever is a long time.
Justinia&apos;s Jackal
*Her eyes narrow to slits and she steps back, looks you slowly up and and down...*
*Whistle!* Attack!
I&apos;ve been captive here at the Hammer&apos;s pleasure for some time. I&apos;m glad to see that chapter has ended. &lt;i&gt;Most &lt;/i&gt;glad.
Halt, elf! What word do you bring?
I will never understand why you have so readily accepted aging. Or digestion. They are frightful pastimes.
No... they had us down below, chained up in the dark... but the Reds were up to something in here...
He&apos;s a travelling man, like all Lone Wolves: goes where the contracts take him. Last I heard though, he was roaming Reaper&apos;s Coast. A &lt;i&gt;bountiful&lt;/i&gt; place to be...
Period
I don&apos;t miss you. Not if you&apos;re who I think you are.
Isolda&apos;s Sandals
You&apos;re right. We won&apos;t get anywhere this way. There&apos;s an easier way.
*Ask them what&apos;s happening here. The region is swarming with Magisters and monsters.*
He scarred me, prince, so I scarred him. Extensively.
The secret passage led to the dungeon below the Fort.
You know me now, don&apos;t you? The real me? You&apos;re not afraid anymore, are you?
Use to Read
*Say that you need to enter the Council of Seven.*
*Tell him you plan each strike with great care, assessing your opponent&apos;s strengths and weaknesses.*
And did my sister make you pay full price for Sourcerous Sundries?
We killed Daeyena, the Elven Scion.
Magnificent horns sprout from your forehead, making you see red. You can rush at your enemies and gore them. Increases Retribution ability by 1 for the duration. Incompatible with Medusa Head.
*His eyes go wide. The mirror falls and shatters on the rocks below.*
Magical Pike
What trickery did the Hammer use to control this thing...?
Full Plate Armour
Good to meet you regardless, lad. Say, you don&apos;t look all that busy. I could use someone to watch my back, and it looks like you could use someone to watch yours.
Livewood
Onward, now; the sooner Fort Joy disappears from the horizon, the better. Perhaps the Seekers need help manning the ship.
*Tell it all the imps are dead.*
It&apos;s really uncanny, you know! Though I guess Kristof looks like one &apos;a them now. All skinny &apos;n&apos; pale &apos;n&apos; all...
Aye... aye. Only... only so much a man can stand before he... before he won&apos;t stand it.
