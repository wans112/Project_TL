*The dwarf stands straight and tall - or at least, as tall as a dwarf can manage.*
I warn you. You do not listen. I am sorry for you.
That&apos;s... that&apos;s an idea.
Funny. &lt;i&gt;So&lt;/i&gt; funny.
He woke something - and it killed him. The armour...it calls itself an Ancestor.
Hah. Happily. Get out of my face and don&apos;t come back. I mean it.
*Tell him you know nothing of which he speaks, but you suspect it&apos;s ancient history now.*
*Sidestep the attack.*
And now you are silent. If only all humans were so thoughtful.
Talisman of the Pilgrim
Freedom is yours, my pets. Enter the world. Own it. Destroy it. Discard it.
*He looks at you and shakes his head.*
*Say her squatters are gone. Best not to ask how...*
&apos;Here lies Maggie Sandanney.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Her body lies in cold embrace.&lt;br&gt;Her soul went to another place.&quot;&apos;
I can hear the guilt in your voice. I do not believe you without proof!
Finn was killed by Source. If a Magister could do that... they wouldn&apos;t be a Magister.
You rot here too, Godwoken. We all rot!
*You reach out to Amadia, but all you can hear is the chirp of birds. Getting up, you see the emblem of a moon carved into the altar.*
*The cub looks like it&apos;s going to cry again.*
Tok.
[UNDEAD] *Ask him if he thinks it&apos;ll be truly worth it in the end - all this just for the taste of wine, the feel of warm flesh...*
Business is business; even the Magisters know that, gator. Get shoppin&apos; or leave me be.
UI Map Down
&lt;i&gt;We must fight.&lt;/i&gt;
There is fighting. I hear Magisters in white fight the Paladins. &lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;I hear of Voidwoken.
Perfect! Simply perfect! Now, teleport me to that mossy rock across the gulch - just by the torch. We&apos;re almost there!
Carpet
*Whisper that she should check her pockets for her spore.*
That&apos;s your idea of fun? What&apos;s wrong with you?
I&apos;ll never forget you, Geraldine.
*Tell her she&apos;s safe - from you at least - as long as she keeps her mouth shut.*
*Then, before your eyes, his spirit dissolves into the sound, his own voice joining the cacophony that you can hear.*
Max
*The warrior charges right through you like a passing shudder. Just as he emerges from your back, you hear an echoing &lt;i&gt;shriek &lt;/i&gt;and feel a curious phantom pain jolt through your senses. You turn...*
*Tell her she needs to lighten up. Maybe some drink and dirt would do her some good.*
*Ifan&apos;s anger rolls off him in waves. You can &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; it. He stands, fists clenched, staring at the ground.*
Let&apos;s just say... folks leave here, but they don&apos;t seem to take their &lt;i&gt;effects&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe I happen to know where everything ends up.
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;ve&lt;/i&gt; noticed.
You can&apos;t be serious. I&apos;ve sought this cur all over Rivellon. You wouldn&apos;t deny me the chance to confront him &lt;i&gt;now?&lt;/i&gt;
*Stare in horror. You&apos;re not going to risk that!*
Explore the temple.
*Ask her to play an old classic. Something you can sing along to.*
Thank you, Lohse. I know this is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; battle above all, but if I&apos;m successful you&apos;ll be free to claim your divinity...
Maol
The gem transported us into a pocket realm.
*You fold your arms, your fingers tapping against bare bone. What&apos;s in it for you?*
*Ralvo counts out the entirety of the table&apos;s pot without breaking eye contact.*
[NOBLE] *You are at the top of society. You don&apos;t know about happy, but it certainly feels &lt;i&gt;right.*&lt;/i&gt;
The White Magisters are hiding in a secret vault beneath the barracks.
No evidence of a crime in here, as far as I can tell.
The eyeballs engraved into the head of this warhammer are unsettling in the extreme. You could swear they blink whenever you look away...
Please, stop toying with me! I&apos;ve waited too long for this!
What?! Paladins. On the double!
*As you reach down, the hound&apos;s flesh twists, forming sharp, jagged spikes. Maybe not...*
Woof!
Level [1]: +[2]% Critical Multiplier, +[3] Movement speed.
* Take your leave. *
You do your part. Then I do mine.
*About Kemm...*
HP
*Despite your efforts to stop it, the feeling expands from your gut, down to your toes, up through your heart, into your hands... and into your head.*
Maybe they&apos;re on to something, then. Maybe we do belong here.
[SEBILLE] *Say you can help him find whatever he needs, but first he must listen to you carefully.*
No cave for you - I tell you this before.
*He ceases tinkering with some kind of mechanism that lies in his lap, and gives you his full attention. A curious smile plays across his lips as he takes you in.*
*She reaches for her face, shocked by the sound, glaring at you in anger. But then she realises - the panic is gone. She can breathe again.*
*She smiles and moves faster, harder. Sweat glistens across her collarbone.*
Magister Prisoner
Spoke to the lady captain, didn&apos;t ye? I seen ye, elf, cosying up. Are ye with her or sail ye with us?
I wonder what this does...
Well, I&apos;m a rat. And you&apos;re some kind of... hm... stick-similar corpse-gobbler. Never the twain shall mix, thus spaketh the reddish large-style flesh-beasts!
Hmm? What? Oh. Kin! New, are you? Very good, very good, make yourself at home.
Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll keep watch.
*Tell her you&apos;ve changed your mind, and you wish to hear more.*
Cherry Necklace
A voice! I can still hear it in the dark. I can hear it whispering. He won&apos;t stop...
This is not your judgement to make, but the God King&apos;s. He has come. I am ready for his gift, and his sanction.
I&apos;ve had some time to think, and there&apos;s a few matters I want to discuss before we carry on.
Lohse&apos;s Theme Ambient version
*Chuckles.* They&apos;ll be the first god in history to do so, but I&apos;ll pray you&apos;re right.
Black Ring
Race Info
*Ponder the strategic implications and say you&apos;re starting to understand his motivations.*
*Mention that she owes you her life. A reward would seem to be in order...*
The cells are empty. Where are the prisoners?
*His eyes flicker open, but he looks like he&apos;s still asleep.*
You... It is you... I have found you... Lohse... womb of demons... vermin...
But what if you could do more? What if you could save them all?
Yes, I suppose you&apos;ll do.
*Ask how an Eternal becomes a general in the Divine Order.*
-ow, Quercus! There is no one that &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;would rather have walked this world with.
*He whispers there really is no need for your assistance, but from the weight of his arms around you, you can tell he&apos;d have trouble getting back up by himself.*
*Fight.*
It is your loss. I only try to help you, as you help me.
You again. Still think you&apos;re too good for me? Or have you changed your tune? I might still compose a poem for you, if you&apos;ve come to your senses...
I knew him, and knew his secrets. I saw his rise and fall as woven into the Tapestry of Time. He branded my truth as blasphemy, and I &lt;i&gt;burn&lt;/i&gt; for it.
Be damned if I know. We had him locked up tight in the hold beneath his office, waiting for Lohar&apos;s go-ahead before we threw him off the cliff.

Didn&apos;t you hear me, you bleedin&apos; fool? Stay &lt;i&gt;away &lt;/i&gt;from my bar!
Inventory Intro
A... Swornbreaker? Please - I beg of you. End this curse.
*Note that if he&apos;s sent to the Empire he&apos;s likely going to war. On your kin.*
*Foaming blood begins to gush from the eyes, mouths, noses and ears of several bystanders. Their flesh melts away, revealing hellish figures beneath.*
And I&apos;ve found the limit of my patience. Your lies won&apos;t buy you any favours from me, reptile.
&lt;i&gt;...you are not enough... you were never enough... you will never be enough... come face the truth... come face up to your lies... YOU ARE NOT ENOUGH...&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you ssserve... &lt;i&gt;serve...&lt;/i&gt; the God King.*
Look. Divinity is an immense responsibility. All that power... it &lt;i&gt;corrupts&lt;/i&gt;.
Yes, yes, I know he&apos;s dead. I am still obligated to perform his wishes. He may not live, but the threat of his curse hangs over me.
I am the rage that reigns...
No sense in losing our heads protecting a thief.
Prices are up, quality is down. Times are tough, and it&apos;s no thanks to you, lizard.
*The spirit&apos;s face contorts in agony as it caves in upon itself and is consumed.*
*Ask what she&apos;s talking about. What darkness?*
*Her wet, fearful eyes flick to you. She lowers her fist just enough to hiss a warning...*
*With great respect, take a piece of heart, put it in your mouth, and chew.*
Hotbar Decks
And then, target in sight, what&apos;s your preferred execution method?
*Use your key.*
*Keeping one hand behind her back, she gestures to the door with the other.*
*You look at the Source around you. The power is immense. Divinity, at your fingertips.*
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her she&apos;s in a state of shock - you &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;her to try and focus on you.*
Lohse&apos;s passenger took control and tried to kill the elf Saheila. We woke her up just in time.
If you ever go to Driftwood, stranger, tell Edderd to make his father proud.
Belt
*Tell the door that you are Godwoken, and you come seeking knowledge.*
[1] allows you to backstab enemies with weapons other than a knife.
Praise be. Very well, Godwoken, listen carefully...
*Cut the ropes and set her free.*
Desert Night 02
Spirit of Baran Levere
*Tell him there&apos;s no time to waste. Those Voidwoken won&apos;t kill themselves.*
*You&apos;ve no use for a Magister - and even less for this traitor. Consume his Source.*
Ain&apos;t that the truth. So. Can I keep the gold? Come on. I really do need it. Swearsies.
I suppose it&apos;s good for one&apos;s peace of mind to show a little compassion once in a while.
Infest
Elvish Flammenschwert
There&apos;s no-one I would trust with this responsibility but you. I know you&apos;ll do what needs to be done - what &lt;i&gt;ought &lt;/i&gt;to be done.
[BEAST] *Say you&apos;re sure she will, if this old tub can stay afloat long enough.*
*Tell the ghost you&apos;re looking for Mordus.*
You did? Where?
Blaithin
We have chosen to impose our will on the ship. It must now do as we command.
*Nod and take your leave.*
Nice &apos;n&apos; slow...
*Ask what it was like, snuffing out all those souls, taking all those lives.*
Lucian help us...
Then I am a free agent! Free to live, laugh... and love... Tell me, oh prince... are you a... bachelor?
*Shake your head and state that you are well-loved the world over.*
Welcome home, master.
Wind Deep Forest 08
I remember running away, with blood on my hands...
Vacuum Aura Scroll
Not really! Violent, sure, but we can deal with &apos;em.
Well - yes? Aren&apos;t you curious?
*The first thing you notice is the figure&apos;s empty, eyeless sockets. The second thing is that your skin is crawling. The third is that your senses feel... heightened. The fourth is that he is - or was - Black Ring.*
Reckon they know what they&apos;re doing. Right?
*Gratiana&apos;s head is bowed. From within her mask you can hear the whispered words of a prayer. She falls silent, turning to face you.*
Rivellon Fries
*Tell her one egg survived, but then... &lt;i&gt;someone &lt;/i&gt;ate it.*
Cover of the Guardian

*Look more closely at the item.*
What kind of Divine were you, as the world battled on?
