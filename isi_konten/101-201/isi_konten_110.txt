In that case, my job here is done. I&apos;ll go find the others and get the hells off this island. I suggest you do the same.
My daughter died when she gave up hope. When she turned against her people.
So much death here. So much sorrow. I see what happens... but I see what must happen, too. I will set this right, in time.
*Fane stares out over the sea, his notebook in hand, lost in thought.*
Kemm&apos;s mansion is rumoured to have secret chambers. What&apos;s he hiding?
Campfire
*The cook acknowledges you with a graceful little bow, but keeps her eyes on you the whole time...*
You, my sister! Help me find it. There is little time.
*What about the second variety? What&apos;s it like?*
*You double over, emptying the meagre contents of your stomach onto the stone floor.*
This painting is an obvious forgery.
[LIZARD] *Seeing this symbol outside ancient imperial architecture is bizarre, but you recognise it instantly.*
*Tell her that whatever it is, she can spill it now.*
[IE_ToggleMap]: open your map. Important characters will &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;mark destinations&lt;/font&gt; on your map.
*Growl...* &lt;i&gt;Y&apos;can&apos;t have&apos;t. &apos;s ours.&lt;/i&gt;
*Voidwoken and undead working together? Wonder what this means.*
Malady... I swear by the ancestors I will strive to be worthy of your sacrifice.
*Tell her it&apos;s anything but funny.*
&lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll gnaw your bloody bones.&lt;/i&gt;
*Push back. Don&apos;t let the figure get into your head.*
Thank you. Now let&apos;s see what visions this dark glass weaves...
Final Price: [1]
Logger&apos;s Cache
*You disagree - humans are superior to all other races. You&apos;re the most prosperous and widespread of them all.*
This hefty blade is an excellent sidekick for bartering, threatening or general intimidation.

*He spent time with Dallis? Ask what he can tell you about her.*
Mag. Armour
Overwrite Save File
*State that her name is Amadia, for she must have the strength of a goddess to resist this demon.*
Well. As I live and scarcely breathe, if it isn&apos;t Ifan ben-Mezd.
*Tell her you have special talents.*
Toggle Waypoint Menu
After the Voidwoken started attacking our city, Lord Kemm investigated and put two and two together. To think they blamed all Sourcerers! The only question remaining is... why?
&lt;i&gt;Good... &lt;/i&gt;I expected no less from you. Just remember - break my Covenant, and there will be dire consequences. Now go - release the Deathfog.
Perhaps not the most appetising thing around, but if you truly want to channel more Source...
*She spins into you, her arms around you, her breath upon you, her rough skin on your skeletal frame. She laughs and leads you to the bed, tearing at your clothes...*
Come at me, big boy.
*Think on it a moment. Take one away... and you have one!*
Open a Portal to a Lava Plane
On his return, Amyro discovered Saheila was dead.
Cryogenic Stasis
No sense hanging &apos;round here, Beast. If Justinia&apos;s anywhere, she&apos;s &lt;i&gt;inside &lt;/i&gt;Arx.
*She looks you slowly from helm to boot.*

I needn&apos;t, of course, remind you how dangerous it is to rattle me, and my needle...
You don&apos;t know? You don&apos;t know the prophecies? &lt;i&gt;&apos;One day a man and a woman will be born, and their skin will be red, and the fruit of their union will be Great Red Dragons.&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
Yes. I see... &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; there. And something &lt;i&gt;else,&lt;/i&gt; besides... but it&apos;s not for me to say. I must get you to Malady. She will know.
*Tell him you&apos;re breathing. By process of elimination: they aren&apos;t.*
More of those damn sentinels!
&lt;i&gt;...you may break one but you cannot break them all...&lt;/i&gt;
Pyroclastic Eruption Scroll
Most of this is scrap.
Same old story. Your Queen is trying to quench the rebellion but the rebels are too quick for her. And in all that, your traders are getting more powerful while your nobility weakens. What part your people will play in the upcoming war remains to be seen.
I made the deal with the demon. We&apos;ll rule together. Light and dark. It&apos;s for the best. When I confront Dallis, Adramahlihk will help me.
*The Magister snatches the note and peers at it.*
Now close your eyes and listen to the heart. Become one with the heart.
[DWARF] *Grumble that you doubt he&apos;d be mounting an investigation if it was some local dwarves who went missing...*
There you stood as a Magister walked in. Still hungry. Feeling a mighty fool.
They took the realm. They took it all. &lt;i&gt;But they don&apos;t know what it is! They don&apos;t know what they have!&lt;/i&gt;
What&apos;s in it for you...? Honour. You might have heard of it.
Better watch yerself, lass. Got greedy eyes on ya. Sets me on edge!
*The dwarf turns away from the window, his dark, narrow eyes taking you in for the first time.*
Mistress is the most generous of mistresses - she will give you anything she has if you help her! But please, &lt;i&gt;hurry!&lt;/i&gt;
Dallis.
*Ask him why, if he recognised you, he did not say something.*
*Look around you, lean in, and ask if it&apos;d be safer not to chase him. Just let him die in the Dunes.*
End Combat Turn
I... cannot offer you much more than my sympathies. Our fates are intertwined, yours and mine. This clouds my vision.
Along with an upset stomach, you&apos;ve received a new Talent: Trade Secrets
Yes... with the voice of a vicious old crone!
Hands. Off.
*The heat of her shame warms your heart.*
*Take a look at what he has to trade.*
Just... go. &lt;i&gt;Go!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you&apos;ve made friends here; you care for them and would see them safely out of harm&apos;s reach, too.*
*A young Magister paces around the brig, fussing over Alexandar&apos;s unconscious form. She leans over and applies a damp cloth to his brow.*
Thank you. Sarias dies well. Dies as an elf warrior.
*Crack your knuckles and attempt to force it open.*
This delicate egg is warm to the touch and pulses with inner life.
*Tell him to hold on - he&apos;s saying that Alexandar is here - and &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;...?*
Magical Dwarven Crossbow
&lt;i&gt;Yer cupboard can&apos;t hid yeh and nor can yer berth,&lt;br&gt;His daggers don&apos; care &apos;bout the gold that yer worth,&lt;br&gt;He&apos;ll bury yer bones &apos;neath a mountain of earth,&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s docked in the bay and comin&apos; your way!&lt;/i&gt;
*She hushes you with an index finger held to her own lips, and continues her search.*
*Say you are a master of demonology. If he refuses, you will sic the denizens of Nemesis upon him.*
Bandit Lizard Rogue
I&apos;m... I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;again!
But I cannot stay here forever. My children must return to Rivellon and fulfil their destinies. However, as long as I am Sworn, as long as the God King lives, this is impossible.
*She smiles...*
*Leave the sword where it is.*
Lose the weapons if you know what&apos;s good for you.
*Ask the spirit what is happening here.*
*She takes one of your hands and leads it to her lips, gently brushing them with your fingertips.*
A beautiful work depicting a troubled day.
*Say you&apos;d like to find a Fighter - someone who can deal plenty of damage, and defend themselves too.*
Why... you - !
It&apos;s a good thing we left when we did. I didn&apos;t want to be responsible for all those souls. Those &lt;i&gt;people!&lt;/i&gt;
...yet never sated, start their search afresh.
*Wonder what he makes of Malady.*
Reckon I look about as Godwoken as you do.
*You tremble with a sensation you haven&apos;t had in a long time. Tell her you feel ravenous and powerful at the same time.*
Because of you! I was imprisoned for trying to fix your mistakes.
*Tell her the bell should ring no more.*
Dead Slave
*Yield to Rhalic, your god and father.*
Ahh, look at you! Pretty, pretty. Come close, won&apos;t you? A little closer still...
Likely story, Wolf. Go on, piss off.
Next is an easy one. Well, maybe not easy, but obvious. Ryker, master of the old graveyard. Now &lt;i&gt;there&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;a Sourcerer you don&apos;t want to double cross. Not far from here either.
Dallis&apos; Orders
Voidwoken!
*And? Did Malady get out of the deal?*
Maybe the Magisters have the right motivations... but their methods are undoubtedly wrong.
Nothing special, but it&apos;ll heat up your dinner better than an upside-down helmet.
*The Silent Monk cocks his right ear toward you, then his left. He appears to be awaiting instructions.*
*Not only does he have one, but he&apos;s so enthralled by the limb he&apos;s cradling that he just waves Fane towards it. He has other things on his mind.*
Deal [1]. Set Suffocation and Silence on target.
*Spits* If he&apos;s behind this, then he&apos;s putting the f-future of Rivellon at stake just to soothe his bruised ego. We need to get past those Shriekers, to f-find someone worthier than him.
*Tell him you&apos;re with him, and ask what comes next.*
Foolish to attempt an escape by sea in these waters.
*The feline spirit opens it&apos;s mouth as if to meow, but you hear no sound.*
*Frown and say of course not - why would he think such a thing?*
Not memories, no. This is the war that looms in my people&apos;s future. A war against those who scorn the ways of the lizards. A war that will require a strong, united Empire.&lt;br&gt;
It is a strong pulse. The strongest I&apos;ve ever known.
You make it sound like she&apos;s a victim, rather than someone who just married into one of the oldest houses in the Kingdom.
Aren&apos;t you a tasty one? Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there. Kari&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt she&apos;ll be caring much who or what she slices.
Well! I -
Worn Teddy Bear
Well, the Order&apos;s right about one thing. First comes Source, then come Voidwoken.
That&apos;s not yours! Hand it over - this instant!
And it&apos;s precisely this sort of understanding that makes me appreciate our journey together.
More dwarves? I&apos;m starting to feel unwelcome.
*Reluctantly he throws you a paltry sum.*  ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Hah. Which part?
*Despite the damage, you can make out the faint pulse of esoteric energy. A pulse that quickens as you approach...*
A lot of blood spilled. Not much to show for it so far.
*Very well. Hunch down and lay your hands on the fawn.*
*He opens a pouch and shows you the contents. It&apos;s certainly an unreasonable sum, but it&apos;s not as outrageous as you might like.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_4_5dac5eea-faeb-459c-b675-46c51519b784])
*You&apos;re overwhelmed with the desire to sink your teeth into this thing - this leech, this beast, this repository of the Source that will feed you.*
A presence within the Helm of Contamination has possessed its wearer.
Consumables
*He looks toward the graveyard.*
*He leans forward for another peck.*
Braccus Rex: A Portrait of Evil, Volume Three
Wh... what? No! My darling! My &lt;i&gt;love!&lt;/i&gt;
Supplies. A crate of food, citrus in particular.*Ahem* He&apos;ll talk, or he&apos;ll die quiet.
*Say you forgot how the joke ends.*
Battered Raft
*Casually mention that you heard there&apos;s still some powerful Sourcerers on the loose in this region.*
Stock up here, and do your people proud.
Can I still play...
It&apos;s like that, is it?
You... you tasted my flesh?!
*Sigh. Bloody simple-minded creatures. Slowly and loudly explain that you need to rip the faces from other creatures. Circle her own face with your finger to demonstrate.*
