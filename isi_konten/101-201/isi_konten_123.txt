*She presses her lips to yours - her mouth is soft, her breath sweet. She kisses you gently, then harder, her teeth raking softly across your tongue.*
Then do it.
*The bilious film reforms in the glass, and becomes... a knight in shining armour, sunshine glinting upon his helm, the light reflecting masking his features. On seeing your face, he snaps the mirror shut.*
The diminutive Godwoken has come, as I foresaw. And as I feared.
*Trace the elongated scar wrought upon you by Tir-Cendelius.*
(reflected)
A case? A whole orchard, more like. Justinia went absolutely cuckoo with power, and it&apos;s the people who are paying the price.
Wonderful! Now... there&apos;s three, eh, &lt;i&gt;samples &lt;/i&gt;that I wish to learn more about... care to choose?
Until later, Godwoken. May you find truth - even when you are least deserving of it.
*Brush the question aside. With authority in your voice, ask him what&apos;s going on.*
*The mechanism clicks once again.*
So... thanks!
Okay. I won&apos;t then. Except you, I trust you.
The Master... Where is he?
*He pulls himself away from you and stands at his full height.*
Do you mind? We&apos;re getting ready for a scrap.
I think I&apos;ve heard about you. Didn&apos;t you free the Meistr from the gallows in Driftwood?
The Savants of the Stonegarden&lt;br&gt;By Merlin Voss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few may hear the calls of the long-dead, but for those of a particular nature, the dead are as loquacious as the living. Those so blessed and cursed are drawn to the Stonegarden graveyard, where they might learn the ways of the ancients and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One such mystic was Mangan Oxe, who gained expertise in both traps and petrification - and, it is said, rigged his own Stonegarden sepulcher with a fossilising mist to petrify meddlesome invaders.
Escape through the dungeon.
*Tell Beast you&apos;ve been thinking about him - and his beard. A lot.*
I should strike you down where you stand, Godtaint.
Damian&apos;s dull knife, this place is horrible. Never mind. Cheers to you, me, and me again!
Umbral Statue
Jonathan...
I have to admit I was curious - imagine if it had been a success! Why then anyone could have ascended. Even I...
Awrite, elf! Right glad Lohar ain&apos;t left us here to wither.
Name?
*Tell her it&apos;s quite incredible. You feel invincible.*
We gave Almira the tablet.
Hamfists
Bird &amp; Wind Country 01
Source Infused
Vampiric Physical
I &lt;i&gt;hunger&lt;/i&gt; for you, Sebille. There&apos;s no stopping me now.
We traded the antique painting to Cat the Appraiser.
Hm. I&apos;m the one who picked it up. I&apos;d say it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; hat now, if it&apos;s all the same. And did you just call it... Fran? Do you &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; your hats?
*He stands still as a statue, flinty eyes glimmering with menace. A raw, animal power exudes from him, triggering your own animal responses.*
Nice!
*Lean in close to catch the scent of the stone.*
*She stands before you in the guise of &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;, the woman you&apos;ve been dreaming of for as long as you can remember. She is unparalleled beauty, and her skin&apos;s as red as yours.*
*Say you don&apos;t know what she&apos;s talking about - what roses?*
Ebony
I became Divine. Rivellon kept its Source. Wonder remained... and suffering too. This is my world to rule, for better or for worse.
*Yank your hand away.*
Know me? I believe we know each other rather well at this point!
Fishbone
Can&apos;t... breathe...
*Tell her you&apos;ll think about it.*
*Accept her proposal.*
Jolting Corpse
I&apos;m not at liberty to discuss that. Sir.
I only mean that if you think about it &lt;i&gt;logically&lt;/i&gt;, she&apos;s much better off.
[SOLDIER] *Note that you&apos;ve stormed keeps beneath a hail of flaming arrows - you&apos;re not afraid of hot stew and paring knives. Why is she so keen for you to leave?*
Old Gray Wolf
She is in grave danger, Your Majesty! You must find her and use your gods-given powers to free her from their clutches!
Passers-by can be distracted from the contents of their pockets by the delightful shine of this glorious ribbon.
You have it, Geraldine.
That was a person once. Maybe it shall be a person again. Maybe.
Fane&apos;s Theme A
[1] tried to open [2], but it&apos;s stuck
Veeros
Give me room, lizard.
The Righteous
!@#$%^&amp;*(&amp;^%$#@
*Nod to the building. What&apos;s up with this place?*
Anathema could&apos;ve solved so much...
Don&apos;t move, Jules. Save your strength.
*Leave her be.*
*He leaps to his feet, seemingly ready to either fight or flee, yet does neither. He looks to each side - and begins to sob.*
Come here, the sun is warm.
Leggings of Insight
*Tell Malady you&apos;ve unlocked Dallis&apos; quarters.*
*Ignore the question and tell him the Sallow Man is dead, and by your hand too.*
*Hand over the parts. You&apos;d like to see what this Anathema can do.*
Sure. That&apos;s the kind of contract some Lone Wolves accept.
To all White Magisters aboard the Lord Dread:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dallis and Vredeman have departed for the Magisters&apos; Barracks, and it is their wish that you leave the meeting site and join them there forthwith. Dallis will instruct you further, and soon after shall reveal The Grand Design of the Divine Order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are your orders. Failure to comply will be considered treason to the law of Lucian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reimond
The Red Prince will fight beside me as I claim Divinity. This gladdens me.
You had your chance. Now you pay!
*She returns to her training.*
Armour of the Eternals
*Ifan chuckles to himself, yet you can feel his eyes watching your face for a reaction.*
*Close your fist over your heart. Bow your head.*
I love you, after all. Better than anyone else could ever dream of doing.
The Aeteran! What an incredible discovery...
*The chest sits there. Closed. Waiting for the magic word.*
Henhouse
Fire Opal
Justinia got a taste of that power the first time she threw a mouthy jester into the dungeon at the urgin&apos; of her advisor, jus&apos; &apos;cause he pointed out her, er, &lt;i&gt;rotundness.&lt;/i&gt; That&apos;s a word, right?
Well, I have what you might refer to as a &lt;i&gt;very keen eye&lt;/i&gt;... but have no fear; your mask will still convince the average unobservant dullard...
Nether Swap Skillbook
*A scarlet courtesan.*
*Tell her she&apos;s wrong - and you&apos;ll fight to prove it.*
Maybe a sip of ale would cure this naggin&apos; headache. Or a pint of it.
*Tell him you&apos;ll be watching him... closer than a hawk.*
Gods, what is that?
*Tell him this whole &apos;living god&apos; thing sounds too good to be true.*
&lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; the word I would have chosen, but you understand my point. I did not suffer the boredom of some spoiled brat: mine was the absolute absence of challenge - the longing not simply to watch the horizon, but to journey towards it.
[VILLAIN] *Tell her she should eat as many truffles as she can. Gets her nice and plump for later roasting.*
With a small band of elves, Ifan ben-Mezd re-planted the lost forests. After the first fresh shoots broke the earth, Ifan returned to the war, leading the elves in service of the Divine. Some say Afrit, his soulwolf, walks the forests still.
*Sneer. If she&apos;s a mother to a Magister, her womb is cursed indeed.*
Within Lucian&apos;s body resides the very power of the Gods, the power to seed a new Divine. He insisted this power remain there, eternally sealed within the tomb. To what ends, I don&apos;t know...
Identify
*Say memory fails you at the moment...*
*She nods a greeting.*
Egad, stop gawking at the Shield! You ought to be quite used to such journeys into that stone realm by now. Meanwhile, the Acorn draws nearer!
I show you. I show you where they wait. I see them... behind my eyes. We go there. They wait for us to return to them...
But the Black Ring was just a bad memory. Who knew they&apos;d return? Who knew it would lead to this madness?
*Fane looks back down to the book, a bony finger running across the embossed leather cover.*
Prepare Campaign
Tanzanite Necklace
[RED PRINCE] *Assure the child you&apos;re no evil ogre, even though the world has condemned you as one.*
The Groom&apos;s Gift
Forest - Bridges
And here I thought I&apos;ve seen everything...
*Tell him you will keep the needs of the dwarven kingdom in mind.*
*She points to the spot on your map, and rubs her palms together as she considers the ways you might annoy and agitate her former friends.*
Monsters! Voidwoken! Run!
*Ask where the cub last saw its mother.*
*Despite your reluctance to answer her, you can feel her presence gently goading you more closely toward her.*
Stairs to the Upper Floor
*She casts her gaze around the crypt in awe.*
*Let her continue.*
Mistral Robe
*Accuse them of being reckless. They put the region in danger.*
Back to Lobby
Ahh, get out of here, will you? Both of y&apos;aint worth my time...
*Ask if you can be her friend. Promise you&apos;ll always be true.*
I will show you the true path to divinity.
*Nod and say it&apos;s very uncomfortable. Could she take it off, please?*
But of course that is what they are saying to their own Godwoken as we speak. We both know they won&apos;t bow, just like we both know &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; will never bow to &lt;i&gt;them.&lt;/i&gt;
I don&apos;t doubt it. But this is not a place to linger in willingly... you would do best to leave, and never come back.
[LOHSE] *Tell him to forget the chest. He can spend his time thinking on important matters philosophical and existential, now that he&apos;s a head on a stick.*
*Protest this unfairness: you helped him get this very bridge!*
[VILLAIN] *Sneer; stuff more hay from the spilled caravan into his quivering hands.*
*Confront Kemm about the demonic plants in his garden.*
Report back to Saheila.
Praying at an altar once more, I again hear the voice, and was filled with Source.
By the Seven, that&apos;s what I&apos;m talkin&apos; about!
I&apos;m not taking any chances. And hey! Maybe they&apos;ve got something sparkly for me.
Oh.
Now we are free. Now we serve a higher purpose. A glorious mission, and neither you nor your kind will stand in our way.
Raider Chief
*Ask why not - if they have a sizeable army and enough boats, there&apos;s no reason why they couldn&apos;t take Fort Joy.*
Empyreo away!
*Sanders considers you for another moment... then relents with a sigh.*
Victor Flynn&apos;s Nest Egg
*The face of a dwarf appears from the shadows. You notice a couple of fresh scratches on his cheek, partially hidden by a thick beard.*
[DWARF] *The symbols are an ancient dwarven dialect. Read them.*
Come on, come on!
You see?
*Wave his chatter aside. You&apos;re not interested in times when people were even more primitive than they are today.*
Pedestal
A mixture of herbs designed to boost the courage of the one who ingests it.
*Agree to help, and ask what to do.*
*Uh oh. You don&apos;t like the way that sounds. Ask her what&apos;s the matter.*
[BEAST] *It&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;Deathfog weapon? &lt;/i&gt;Whatever Justinia means to do with it, you have your own plans. Smash it.*
*She reaches underneath a table... and yanks out a large, wicked-sharp knife.*
What if the fire spreads? What if those monsters spread? If only Lucian were still here.
Exploration Theme 01 Light Orchestral
They did as they saw fit. Far be it from me to judge the Seven.
Something which seems unlikely in the depths of this swamp. Perhaps we should explore the coast?
This clammy wand feels soggy in your grip. Put it to use, however, and witness as floods of magic pour forth from its tip.
*Note the dried blood upon the blade.*
or did he wander the wilderness?
*Change your mind. You&apos;ll kill Jonathan - and you&apos;ll bring Gareth proof.*
Creation
*Tell him you know he belongs to the God King.*
Min Ydra
Toyseller Sanders is dead.
