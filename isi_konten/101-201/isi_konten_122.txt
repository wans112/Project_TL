Right is on my side!
Maybe she cut his finger off first, did you think about that, smarty pants?
One of the Magisters didn&apos;t know when he was beaten - drove a spear into my knee. He should&apos;ve aimed higher though - I didn&apos;t give him a chance to land a second blow.
I reckon I could help you out. Depending on what you can do for me.
A smart point, but there&apos;s many a rumour that those inside the cells stand a better chance of escape than those of us out here.
It has been quite unexpected, I must say.

I&apos;m an Arx man through and through - Farro would have me abandon it all for some log cabin, but what kind of a life is that?
The biggest is the queen&apos;s rotten business, though. She&apos;s got plans to release Deathfog in Arx - and that ain&apos;t good. I swear she&apos;s not in her right mind &apos;cause of that advisor of hers, Isbeil. The shite, as they say, is about to hit the wind.

We don&apos;t speak of His Holiness in those terms in &lt;i&gt;civilised &lt;/i&gt;society. Your mother ought to have taught you better than that.
*The spirit looks overhead and raises her arms, as if expecting a saviour to swoop to her aid. Of course, no soaring liberator arrives. She begins to trace another pattern in the air...*
[RED PRINCE] *As you leave the stinking dwarf, one of the barrels catches your eye. Lean in to investigate.*
Stirrup Crossbow
In my time, I&apos;ve worn many hats - many of them pointed. I&apos;ve been a scholar. An engineer, of sorts. A protector of towns and villages. A thief. A lover. For one particularly memorable period of time, I was a cat.
*Your lips open, but no words spill forth. You try to lift your head, but it is no match for gravity. She has paralysed you. Only your eyes are free to move.*
We located Saheila. She needs help.
From the thick grime that encrusts this tub, you&apos;re quite sure you wouldn&apos;t want to soak in it too long...

I hear whispers in the wind, kin. Saheila speaks a single name - the hope of the elves. &apos;Sebille&apos;.
Now, the House of Shadows moves against you, but in the House of Dreams you have an ally.

It catches fire, it turns to must when wet; it cannot even resist acid! No wonder they&apos;re so bloody ignorant...
This is my scar song. It&apos;s all the Master needs to make me his slave once more. Unless &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; voice opposes his.
You are not worthy of this temple. Leave.
*Tell the Magister he had the wrong man - the chef was the real killer.*
Sebille, is it? Have we met? I don&apos;t seem to *Cough* remember that name. Though there&apos;s something familiar about your face... your cheek...
Will you not obey? Will you not kiss my feet like you kissed your Master&apos;s?

*Steel yourself. You have heard of the Voidwoken here, and you wish to fight it.*
*The author delights in regaling you with long, tedious tales of skinning and tanning the hides of various animals. The animals seem less delighted. The practical skills to be gleaned are few, but valuable. For the rest, that is time you&apos;ll never get back. For this you would tan the author&apos;s own hide.*
