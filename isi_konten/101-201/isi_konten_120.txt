*Where were you just now? Lost inside. Lost deep inside. The &lt;i&gt;thing &lt;/i&gt;was in control; it held your spirit by the throat; you couldn&apos;t speak, you couldn&apos;t act. You&apos;re you again, for now, but your body and soul ache terribly.*

Hail Strike Skillbook
Thanks to Meistr Siva, we know what we must do to unlock our potential and become Divine.
Come to see the show, stranger? I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ve missed most of the slaughter, but there&apos;s still blood to be spilled.
First you tell me not to trust the word of the bastard that said that, and now you throw his vile accusations in my face?
Cupboard
*Ignore his snooty remark and tell him you&apos;ve been having strange dreams that urged you to find a Dreamer.*
*She glares as you walk by, seemingly nursing a grudge.*
Medat
*Various shades of grey swirl across the globe&apos;s surface, then part. You are free, joined by Seven others, summoned by sacrificial Source.*
Goodness - how could I not? Her work on Blackpeak Isle is legendary, or so she tells it, at least. The King has an eye for the arrogant; they make such valuable stewards as they clamour for his favour, as I well know.
*Ifan smiles at you. The smile &lt;i&gt;looks &lt;/i&gt;genuine, and he &lt;i&gt;looks &lt;/i&gt;relieved. But can you trust your eyes? Can you trust a Lone Wolf?*
We both know what comes next. You&apos;ll see Jonathan dead. And you&apos;ll bring me proof.
*Ask him the same.*
*Ask her where the creature ran off to.*
You may recognise the people in it. Alexandar, of course, and your own king Ghonghi. Justinia, the dwarven queen, and the great elven seer Tiriara, too.
Here - your reward.
So this is it. The Temple of the One.
*Tell him that Arx is safe once more. He can return there.*
How regrettable! And here I was on the very cusp of making you an offer. You are Godwoken after all, and Godwoken are in need of teachers...
Transform into the form of a Human, switching racial talents, skills and tags.
I ain&apos;t gonna say it again. Pay what you owe.
Careful there! I tend to meet insult with... well, death.
Bone Widow
Smart Leggings
*Beast hums a jaunty tune as you near and holds his fingernails up to examine them. He does not wish to chat.*
Oh, why do I always find myself alongside those who would split the world apart in search of power...? No matter. This is my place, it seems...
Mysteriously, this lizard&apos;s leg was buried in a human grave.

To think that some people value baubles and trinkets over books! Absurd.
It&apos;s just... I&apos;ve a proposition. Something... something very worth knowing. But. It&apos;s hardly a group affair. I only need one.
Numpad 1
Flames. Flames everywhere...
I felt so much pain. So much fear...
*Note that the Lady Vengeance looks as good as new. How did she manage to repair it?*
*Ask to trade.*
*The spirit looks at you in horror. Dropping to her knees she begs to be allowed to exist: silent pleas falling on deaf ears.*
Other Godwoken. When Lucian died, we waited. And waited some more. Alexandar never rose to Divinity. Then we started to find more like him.
Here, Godwoken. Let me guide you.
No, it... it hurts... huh?
Then you will join him in death!
*Nod your head in deference.*
Changing direct connect settings failed
*Stay silent.*
*The world around you melts away and you are standing with the skeleton once more.*
Don&apos;t hesitate to return to the Arena. The Burnished One is always watching.
Well hello again. Welcome to my very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;humble abode.
*An avalanche of further spectral debris collapses on top of him.*
*Thank him for the information and take your leave.*

Blood need not be spilled. Bones need not be broken. Preserve thyself, and flee.
*The statue still smells... off.*

But my empire? That will be eternal. For with Red Dragons in the sky it shall be untouchable!
Your eyes pierce the veil of the Hall of Echoes.
Doesn&apos;t surprise me one bit.
*There doesn&apos;t seem to be a way to open it, but you can&apos;t shake the feeling that the face on the door is watching you.*&lt;br&gt;
Order and Magic
Now come on, elf. If you make me say it again, there&apos;s gonna be trouble...
My, my. Aren&apos;t &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;looking well.
Whispers of Sadha
It&apos;s a beautiful instrument... but I have no idea how to play it.
*Ask him what happened.*
Companion Origin Moments
Nice to feel wanted.
That explains things, Susan.
*Wonder how he feels about having to hide his true face in fear.*
*Tell him that extra threat will cost him the contents of the safe.*
*A little back and forth ensues, money crosses hands and soon Sebille has all the information she needed.*
Controller disconnected
Let&apos;s take care of the business at hand. Then we can chat.
*He suddenly freezes as he sees you properly - his eyes bulge with fear.*
My daddy once said &apos;don&apos;t go to the toilet on your own doorstep&apos;. Then my mum chased him away for going in the bedroom. Them crates belong to dwarves. We leave &apos;em alone. The crates &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;the dwarves.
*Her eyebrows shoot up.*
Bridge to Bloodmoon Island
And I can set &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; free in return. Say your prayers while you&apos;ve breath to speak them, lad. The Halls await...
[UNDEAD] *Admit that you don&apos;t feel much of anything. Not in this state.*
Bring them back! BACAW!
Giant slayer! Back to refill your quiver, are you?
Sorry. I can&apos;t let you through.
Leave me be, elf. This traitor needs my attention.
*Any warmth in the cook&apos;s eyes drains away. She holds your gaze for a long moment, then - *

Occult Helm
Magical Two-Handed Straight Axe
As you wish.
No place is safe while &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;lives! Neither this crumbling temple nor the shore indeed!
*Say absolutely nothing could keep you from it.*
I... I have to go!
Willpower
*Tell him you did what was necessary. Don&apos;t show him how you feel about it.*
From what I gather you&apos;ve a certain... martial quality about you. A desire for conquest; for victory won by the blade. There can be no doubt that would place you in...
P-p-p-p-&lt;i&gt;play?&lt;/i&gt;
He was - is - one of the engineers who designed the Path of Blood on behalf of Lucian. He&apos;s a genius, but his ways are, let&apos;s say, &lt;i&gt;idiosyncratic.&lt;/i&gt;
*The undead turn as one to stare at you. Their empty eyes drinking you in...*
Trust me, today&apos;s Divine Order has nothing to do with Lucian&apos;s. Everything, &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; started to go downhill during the war, right after my last mission.
Old news. Got anything else for me?

The riches world over do they seek...
No offence, but I&apos;d rather save my breath and talk directly to the one who recruited me.
*Snap that you&apos;re doing a lot for him. What&apos;s he doing for you?*
*Say that if he feels so strongly about her, maybe all of this is a bad idea.*
Leave a fellow to his sleep, hmm? We may be in prison, but we aren&apos;t savages.
*The elf peers down her nose and sniffs her disdain.*
Almost all of them seem to have been disposed of while still wearing perfectly serviceable faces.
Cookware
*He reaches out and feels for your shoulder. He shakes it twice, then reaches up and pats your cheek, probably a little harder than he means to.*

How could such simple beasts know my name? Surely my fame has not spread that far...
And speaking of poor decisions, I have notes to compile. If you don&apos;t mind...
Disrespecting one Magister&apos;s enough - go on, get lost.
[Translate103_3a4f9a98-07a1-4a20-a76e-dd86a3caef80]
I know... and I think Lucian would have concurred, if he was still with us. I will help you.
I&apos;ve been sailin&apos; for a long time, but I don&apos;t know I&apos;ve ever seen so much &lt;i&gt;drama, &lt;/i&gt;not in all my years! Hookin&apos; up with your crew&apos;s been nothin&apos; if not eventful, my boy.
*You think you probably &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;going to have to kill her.*
*Snap that you don&apos;t have time for this. You&apos;re not here to serve him.*
He came here under the guise of friendship, and instead he &lt;i&gt;killed &lt;/i&gt;all of us. Madness, surely... but who can question the actions of the Divine...?
You are a very, very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;lucky person. If Malady hadn&apos;t restored us, I&apos;d... well, I&apos;d be a drooling monstrosity. But a &lt;i&gt;vengeful &lt;/i&gt;one.
I nearly took you for a Magister and put a blade through you. That was close.
If you can guess the answer to my riddle, I&apos;ll give you a good discount on our Sourcerous Sundries. What do you say?
Unhappy? Yes. They&apos;ve been scattered by fog and wind to every corner of the world. And like most elves, these ones wait - for some&lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, some&lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;.
You schemin&apos; bastard! Deathfog? Give me one good reason I shouldn&apos;t split &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; your heads in two!
Liquidate the imposter.
*The man sighs and quickly snaps the gauntlet around his wrist.*
*Who are you? Tell the cat you look forward to finding out.*
Oh, you! Flattery won&apos;t get you a discount - but I&apos;ll give you another go, miss cheeky!
Raider Huntress
*Ask the spirit what she knows about Source Vampirism.*
*Shrug. Whatever you think, you&apos;re stuck here with them now.*
*Ask him to explain.*
Well... it&apos;s sad, but I don&apos;t blame you. It&apos;s like Harlan B. says in &lt;i&gt;T Is For Troll: &lt;/i&gt;&apos;Trolls are typically omnivorous, but many are known to develop a taste for humanoid flesh.&apos;
Gareth might know how to deal with the Shriekers.
How on earth am I supposed to... oh, perhaps...
Although it seems you already have quite a pack of travelling companions.
Cursed Electrified Blood Surface
Word has reached me the fabled Red Princess is safe and sound! So why not buy yourself something pretty? To celebrate!
*Consider the possibility. Eternals and mortals, living together...*
*Say a Magister-killing weapon seems a good use to you.*
*The spirit of the White Magister says nothing, and just looks at you with trepidation.*
You think yourself noble do you? You&apos;re less than vermin next to I - the most powerful Sourcerer for as far as the eye can see!
[FANE] Alive he is a risk, but nothing is safer than the grave. I say we put the beast down and be on our way.
*Actually, perhaps  you&apos;ve come to the wrong place. Excuse yourself and leave.*
They must have many secrets to go to all these lengths...
The poor drowned Sourcerer&apos;s corpse lies here - yet there is no ghost. Strange.
*Tell him the temple stands and all is well.*
Look. I don&apos;t know you and you don&apos;t know me. Clear?
[NOBLE] *Ask him what crime saw him end up a head on a stick.*
