I knew those Magisters for years. Trained with them.  We&apos;ve saved each others&apos; lives more than once. They&apos;re family...
Fresh meat, &lt;i&gt;mbaaaaa&lt;/i&gt;? Nice. Plump. Banded like a chicken&apos;s leg too.
*Shout: WAKE UP!*
Look at this! May seem like a mess, but it looks to me like... like having hope again. I was afraid we&apos;d lost the place for sure. Thank you so much for your help.
*Tell him you should get out of here. And so should he.*
It must have been the Voidwoken! Or maybe the Black Ring? Or- the Magisters?
I don’t think I can bear another day here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s one thing to be taken from your home, thrown into prison, fed scraps, told to wait for your death day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s another to suffer fools all the while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope the Magisters take me soon.
Lohar didn&apos;t tell me to let any walking scarecrow in. So why should I?
Suck a hot iron. &lt;i&gt;GO&lt;/i&gt;.
*Say that you&apos;ve been told it&apos;s imperative to get this ship sailing; you have to search everywhere.*
*Tell her you&apos;re a Sourcerer, too. It&apos;s a comfort to know people like them exist.*
*Wonder if it was a display of Source that got him into trouble.*
Watch yerself, girl.
*He envelops you, his rough skin on yours. He laughs and leads you to the bed, tearing at your clothes...*
The Empress manipulated an artisan to create armour from the bones. When I pleaded with her to cease, she used the armour to rip out my soul.
Things do not end well for Alexandar. Trust me.

*Nod. He kept up his end of the bargain.*

Show me the goodness of your heart, Godwoken, and I will share my power. Take one step closer to Divinity. &lt;i&gt;Set me free...&lt;/i&gt;
Hit_Melee_Std_5
G-get away from me you freak. You don&apos;t know anything about me!
Call me what you like. I&apos;m not afraid of being the villain to your supposed &apos;hero&apos;. I&apos;m not nice, Ifan. I&apos;m just &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
*You look around in shock as the mist clears. You are standing in a library - &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;library. You hear a cough behind you and turn to see your assistant, Harina.*
Valve Full Open
Poor thing. Maybe someone else will come to help her.
The Wayfarer was not born of woman, but of beast... or so the rumours go. Raised by the creatures and trees of the Phantom Forest, the Wayfarer learned the art of survival before that of speech.  Beasts that would have destroyed another human in single swipe were the Wayfarer&apos;s caretakers and playmates; dodging lightning storms, a matter of survival for most, was the Wayfarer&apos;s favourite sport.  When the Grandmaster of the Order of the Source Hunters learned of this remarkable person, he ordered an expedition to make contact. Though wary of leaving the wilds, the Wayfarer was eager to learn more about these strange but powerful Source Hunters...
H-a-a-a-ven&apos;t got any shears, have you? People these days...
*Sneer and say that he seems to have an inflated opinion of himself.*
Come on, Zee, that&apos;s not how this works.
I&apos;m not surprised you&apos;re bitter. I heard what happened in the elvish homelands. But we need a Divine, now more than ever. I only hope Bishop Alexandar will ascend before it&apos;s too late.
I sent some people to find him, but he abandoned his house. Sure as sin he left something behind, something that&apos;ll speak to where he went, but my folks haven&apos;t brought back anything of value. You find something, and I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll be able to put some important pieces together.
*These once magnificent quarters have fallen into rotten disrepair. As your eyes adjust to the dark, you see Captain Sech Zapor, now gallantly dressed.*
Infected
*The spirit nods a solemn greeting.*
Weapon Chamber Key
Thank you for your help, do I. Now, I&apos;ll thank you for your life.
In that case, you&apos;d better think &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;carefully about the next words that escape your stinking trap.
The God King feeds on war, on death, on disease - on the rich Source the living once carried within them, knowingly or not. I&apos;d think this clear by now, particularly to one sworn to fealty.
[HERO] *Draw yourself up. He betrayed the Seekers after they took him in. He was, indeed, a Mistake.*
*You can feel her drawing grateful strength from your support.*
*Growl that you&apos;ll be back in a minute.*
I am the voice of the fire. My flame bears the will of all elves and lights the way for those who wish to prove their mettle...
We make a good team, don&apos;t we, chief. A &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;good team.
Here&apos;s &lt;i&gt;half. &lt;/i&gt;If I were you, I&apos;d avoid attracting &lt;i&gt;their &lt;/i&gt;attention. If you start causing trouble, you may well be rendered *whispers* &lt;i&gt;incompatible.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrug. Elves are no better or worse than any other race - some races look at their cannibalism in horror, but for you it&apos;s cultural and ritualistic.*
*Ignore him; you&apos;re in no mood to get into this now.*
*Tell her it&apos;s fine. She needn&apos;t go on.*
[IFAN] *Mercenary? Tell him that he wouldn&apos;t last a week in the Lone Wolves.*
Solve Carver&apos;s disappearing Magister problem.
*You don&apos;t lie, you speak truth: his companions asked you to tell him they&apos;ve unearthed the key to making the tree speak down in the archives.*
Mystical Giant Thunder Rune
*Shrug. You don&apos;t particularly care.*
*Shrug. You&apos;re just another broken soul trying to get fixed. Nod your goodbyes and turn away.*
*The dog trembles as you approach and hides its head deeper in its belly.*
I ain&apos;t afraid of what I know. I&apos;ve gotta go back to the kingdom, and see the queen. There&apos;s a lot to do there. Damage that needs undone. Dwarves&apos;ve lived in fear for too long, on the outside &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the inside.
*Your tears mingle with those of the goddess down in the tranquil, crystalline pond.*
Welcome to the House of Rhalic. What brings you to my master&apos;s abode?
These weapons do not kill - but maim in the most horrible way. With them you can steal the Source of your enemies and make it your own.
Deals [1] each turn. Cannot be extinguished.

*The dragon&apos;s triumphant roar sends a ripple of heat through the dream. That fire is soon to be yours.*
Mad...
What?! No. No! PLEASE!
Burst into quite the bloody mess, she did.
There&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; on this island, known as the Sallow Man. He is a master of mirrors.
Ours. Ours. You are ours.
Easy enough.
Spirit of Mihaly
You are just aching for some prison time.
Confound it! Are you this thing&apos;s master or slave? Hold it back this instant!
*Tell her that you&apos;re just a Sourcerer trying to save their skin.*
*Grit your teeth and agree. But if he tries to trick you, you&apos;ll break every bone he has.*
Queen-approved gear, yours for the perusin&apos;!
This ain&apos;t right. This ain&apos;t fair!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maximum Action Points: [1]
*...you take a huge risk. While he picks a card, you reach into his pocket.*
I wonder if I still remember Papa Joris&apos; favourite song...

Camera Rotate Left
I wouldn&apos;t do anything wrong, mister. You gotta believe me! Let me out? Please? I&apos;m not a mistake!
After all you&apos;ve done to us, and you would still plead for mercy? No. The Swornbreaker will never be yours.&lt;br&gt;
*The dwarf mutters a word and the undead lurch towards the intruder, but are cut down like wheat. The dwarf tries to run, pushing her &apos;friends&apos; into the woman&apos;s path, but is grabbed before she can escape.*
That old thing? It was passed to me by my father Johannys, and my father&apos;s father Johannys, and my father&apos;s father&apos;s father&apos;s father Johannys. Don&apos;t know what happened to the one in the middle.
Cowl of The Pilgrim
*He used to work here? Jokingly ask if he left anything behind on his desk.*
*Snarl that you are neither. You simply no longer believe in blind loyalty.*
We tried. The moment we arrived here, that priestess had us bring the wounded to the spring. How I wish it would&apos;ve worked... but their injuries were too great.
Voice of Flame
Duna’s Undertaker appeared after we placed Source-Infused Meat on the altar.
*Ask one more question before you go...*

*Say you&apos;re looking for someone who doesn&apos;t mind getting their hands dirty - picking a few locks, stabbing a few backs. A Rogue would fit the bill.*
Purging Wands. But you knew that. We got the last of &apos;em out of Braccus&apos; old armoury.
Did you show mercy or strength?
Hurry it up, won&apos;t you? Never know when Alice might get back...
*Cough and politely ask what it might contain.*
*Insist you&apos;d go even further: depose Justinia and take it for yourself.*
We&apos;re battling for our very survival. It&apos;s a battle we&apos;re losing, and should we truly lose, &lt;i&gt;ALL&lt;/i&gt; will be cast into oblivion.
Whatever it is, there&apos;s powerful magic within. We must unlock its secrets.
*The spirit of a dwarf cowers behind some rubble. One of her legs is suddenly yanked backwards, and she&apos;s hauled upwards into the air.*
*Remark that you didn&apos;t think he&apos;d be fulfilling any destinies - you were convinced that he was dead.*
And I trust you. With more than my life.
Well, bugger it then. I&apos;ll go look for myself.
Send a wave of healing to target another character. The wave travels to nearby allies, healing with each movement.

*Ask him where they&apos;ve taken your stuff.*
&lt;i&gt;I... pledge myself... to... the King.&lt;/i&gt;
Worry not, the wound tells the eye a lie. In truth, the pain is not so bad. The Lone Wolf in the mill, who cuts me so, has luck upon his side. For now. Not so our own dear Sarias.
&lt;i&gt;Oh Mighty Duna, save your children... deliver us from the Void... Oh Mighty Duna, save your children... deliver us from the Void... Oh Mighty Duna...&lt;/i&gt;
Tarquin is dead. We may never know what he hoped to achieve.
*Of course, tell her you&apos;ll promise her anything she wants.*
Tovah! NO! NO!
Never trust a merc, Sourcerer. They&apos;ll tell you lies then leave before the fighting starts. Now... time to die.
*As the Dreamer&apos;s Source flows into you, the cool rush of power suddenly burns white-hot.*
Fire Immunity
[SWORN] *The God King&apos;s will is clear: She is to &lt;i&gt;die.*&lt;/i&gt;
You consume those who seek to help you...? You are not Godwoken, you are a creature of the Void - away with you!
Water Resistance
One saved is better than none, but I grieve for those we lost.
With the Magisters gone, this&apos;ll be the end of the Voidwoken attacks. I hope.
A shame to have lost your wager. But be grateful the stakes were lower for you than for her.
Defeated. Narrowly, some might say. Too bad.
*Look around the hold. Some people are missing. Ask her where they are.*
