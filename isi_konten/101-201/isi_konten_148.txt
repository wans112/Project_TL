*Tell him he&apos;s about to die at the hands of a Godwoken. Ask him how it feels.*
Talk to the figurehead and see, why don&apos;tcha?
*Squint and say she looks just like a warrior princess you used to know...*
The King will return. You stand in the way.

A Trial for All Seasons
Are you feeling quite well, my boy?
Don&apos;t fool yourself. In the absence of a master, a master will rise. King, god: there is still power to be had.
Don&apos;t threaten &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;with a bit of fun.
I insist you stop!
The world needs someone to safeguard it against the Void. With the powers of the gods, you&apos;ll do a great job. Don&apos;t you think?
*The air here has a familiar smell, like the place you grew up. Old memories begin to well within you, but the sweet-sour smell of decay suddenly punctures them.*
*Your hand reaches through the spirit. Your Source is inert; you see no memories, siphon no emotions. Its face grows even more tortured. It is trapped. By what or by whom, you cannot say.*
Delorus is a fool. Went and got himself caught, and now he&apos;s handing out our secrets to any old lizard that happens to scuttle by.
Kemm&apos;s Vault: Floor One
&lt;i&gt;Yours&lt;/i&gt; for instance. Heh-heh-heh! Oh, I&apos;d recognise that pretty face of yours in a sea of thousands.
Are you sure you&apos;ve done everything you meant to do here? I could&apos;ve sworn you had an old friend to meet, or some such. We won&apos;t be returning here, you know.
They have gone. I can only hope for good.
*The Magister ignores you. You hear the faint sound of barely-audible praying beneath her breath.*
Lohse&apos;s a good host, Jahan. We&apos;re going places. It&apos;s no concern of &lt;i&gt;yours.&lt;/i&gt;
What I do best. &lt;br&gt;
*You take her words to heart. Leave the Dreamer alone.*
Character cannot use weapons for attacks or skills.
Well.
So, are you buyin&apos;, or are you sellin&apos;?
The dragon hatched. We left it with its mother.
So... yeah. Hopin&apos; to find this Lohar fella and stop this Operation Downfall thing. And there ya have it. Tangent-free. Mostly. Well, not mostly. A little. Okay. Not at all.
*He nods at you and continues with his work.*
*You stand... stunned. Before you, as if she stepped out of a dream, &lt;i&gt;She&lt;/i&gt; awaits: the woman you&apos;ve dreamt of since birth. The Red Princess...*
What&apos;s to think about?
High
*Change your mind. Pocket the potion and make to leave.*
*Tell him this is his chance to fight back. His story could help you save others.*
It isn&apos;t my job to educate you; it is &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;job to look beyond the obvious and see the sublime just past the surface.
*Sink to the ground. Just for a moment...*
Trying to bribe me is a daft mistake. You&apos;re under arrest!
*Flash him a thumbs up and turn to leave.*
You do that. Now away with you.
I shall continue my search for a lizard dreamer in Driftwood.
*Smile and say that you&apos;d choose a warm rock over a damp hole any day.*
Really? Didn&apos;t even sound like you&apos;d ever heard of the guild a minute ago...
Ancient Empire Rhino
*The rat gives you a long stare that tries to say &apos;that&apos;s not true&apos;. It fails. The rat sobs.*
Dead men have no no weeds, no dreamy-dreams. Need another starmaker.
Just play it cool. We go in. We get answers. We leave. Nothing more to it than that...
You are a lizard. Perhaps a slaver. Why would I freely chain my fate to one like you, like I was once forced to?
Manage Default Encounter
So many souls...
*Nod and say that Magister Borris told you to seek him out.*
Truthseeker
Well, alright then.
Aye. That it does. I&apos;m not a free man anymore. I belong to Rivellon now.
*Ask how he&apos;s hoping it&apos;ll end.*
*...sproing!*
Launch
Resting
One candle soul was virtuous. He made a pact with Adramahlihk to save his sickly child. To weaken the demon, flame and soul must die.
*You are about to taste oblivion - and it shall not taste at all. Fear flashes through you... and then you realise that you are about to become, at last and forever...*
You look like my daddy. His name is Freder. He&apos;s waiting for me at home.
Bones fare well at sea. Neither shipwreck nor shark can threaten them.
*Blink.* Who was... who was lost?
Fine. Take it. Plenty of other marks &apos;round here. Have a cracky day.
My princess will make for a glorious ruler one day, but her temper has been the end of many... tread carefully.
Bandit Dwarf Archer
[LIZARD] *Note that when sung, certain dialects of your mother tongue can be used to control slaves...*
*Make a proposition: You&apos;ll find back the stolen supplies, and Griff will free Amyro.*
Put it out! Put it out! Put it ouuuuuuuuuuut!
You&apos;re so kind. So terribly kind.
Quite. Which goes for the dry parts round here too I imagine.
Stolen
I&apos;m no fan of the Order now. You know that. But Lucian... Lucian was different.
She&apos;s down. Finally!
*Ask where you&apos;re going.*
I refuse to entertain the possibility. Yes, the Void is stronger than ever. But, so are you!
Well... but... hmm. I... um. Let&apos;s just move on to the next question.
I should go now, there&apos;s lots I want to see.
I can rest easy, now that the Doctor is slain. Farewell.
No wonder the flatfoots were so easy to defeat.
Though, I did see one of &apos;em wringing out their tunic at the shore a few hours ago, so I guess &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;of &apos;em survived at least...
After all that we&apos;ve been through since Fort Joy? After all &lt;i&gt;that,&lt;/i&gt; to end up with a tyrant once more? To settle for slavery and corruption over change?
*Tell her you make your own laws. If she gets your drift.*
A twisted wand that seems to ooze malevolence from every nock and crack in the ancient wood it is carved from.
No less than the Groom&apos;s own wand; capable of summoning a poison elemental.
A lizard contracts Roost to kill the Scions. One who keeps to the shadows. One who hides his face from light.
But nothing came of it.
I am here to meet you, just as you are here to meet me.
* Take your leave. *
You can&apos;t always get what you want.
*Muse evilly about your accuser&apos;s family members. Spouse? Children? Would be a real shame...*
Motion Blur
*Gareth stares blankly forward.*
Yes. But are &lt;i&gt;they?&lt;/i&gt;
Social Interaction
Hazel Bow
*The cook smiles politely at you.*
There should be a pressure point around here somewhere.
Barin! My loyal lad. I gotta run - or *ungh* waddle back over to &apos;im. Guess those beasties landed a swipe or two, after all.
She knows what&apos;s coming. It seems that fate turns my hand.
Go on, then.
Steel Cuisses
Symphony of the Void
*Alexandar dies and you are bereft. Worse, your human comrades look at you askance, as if his murder was your fault. At the last, even Borris turns against you - when he&apos;s posted to Fort Joy, he does not say goodbye.*
*Gareth notices your arrival and emits an alarming chuckle.*
I just... do things anyway. The fear doesn&apos;t go away, but my body&apos;s used to the rush by now.
*Look around you, lean in, and whisper that it might be safer not to chase him. Just let him die in the Dunes.*
Weight
*Shake your head.*
*Hiss at the elf to keep his voice down - there could be Magisters afoot. Besides, &apos;you&apos; don&apos;t know him.*
No. Please don&apos;t. You&apos;re a Sourcerer. Your magic is dangerous.
*...and then stops as he&apos;s cleansed of his sins.*
I have business with the mother...
- he moves hell and earth and the great oceans too my old mother said but she was wrong she was wrong about Lucian the God King has the power the God King commands the world -
&lt;i&gt;YOU! &lt;/i&gt;You have hampered me long enough. This place will be your tomb - the only one you shall enter.
Spirit of a Dwarven Archer
I... I... oh Seven&apos;s sympathy, I saw those &lt;i&gt;things &lt;/i&gt;dragging the Sourcerers along the cliffs... towards the wreckers&apos; caves. I... I... &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;, no more! It&apos;s gone!
*Hold still. Your actions depend on what happens next.*
This woman is a Dreamer, the very one I&apos;ve been looking for, and I can see the answers spinning in her eyes. Do rest your legs for a bit while I question her.
How dare it, Quercus, they are nothing like me! It knows nothing about me! It-... oh hush, no one needs an explanation.
[IFAN] Whatever this &apos;Covenant&apos; is, it didn&apos;t bring them victory...
Well, aren&apos;t you industrious!
*Admit that becoming a god does sound appealing.*
What if someone&apos;s still in there?
*Press your hand against the symbol.*
*Ask about his travels. Where&apos;s his favourite place?*
How could you, turncoat? How could you?!
I am too, I must say. Good to know someone&apos;s got your back when the going&apos;s tough...
With a single burst you&apos;ll usher in a new age; a new creed before which all must bow - a dawn of flame!
*She gives you the same icy, fiery stare.*
The range of bows and crossbows is limited, but look for high ground to significantly increase their range!
The Seven have done right by us in the past. Call me a traditionalist, but why forsake them now?
Braccus Rex&apos; Tower
*He doesn&apos;t look over as you approach. It&apos;s only when you&apos;re standing right beside him that you see that his eyes are clouded and grey as his hair. He is completely blind.*
Lohse
Find the Sourcerer Migo.
*Gaze down at the wreck below. Ask what happened.*
*Agree and part ways. High time to get moving again.*
..HungryCheeseBerry.
Attack_Ranged_5
He promised me a path unburdened by Lucian&apos;s &lt;i&gt;pathetic&lt;/i&gt; need to defend the defenceless. He promised me a world dominated by the worthiest bloodlines across the ages.
[BEAST] *Smile. Run a gentle hand along the length of your beard. Tell him a despot is going to die.*
[LOHSE] *Ask about his travels. Where&apos;d he hear the best music?*
|Rifle|
*Yes, yes, the Spouse of the Sun, the World-Tamer. Say you know the stories, but that is all they truly are.*
*Kiss him back.*
I see, I see... Now tell me more. Tell me what you do. Tell me what you find.
Negotiate with Big Tomorrah.

If you take one step past this gate, I&apos;ll do just that.
*Assure him that you&apos;ll be right back, and then you&apos;re both going to walk out of there.*
Help! Over here!
Enjoy it while you can. All my life I served Lady Luck and see how it ends? In the dirt, just the same as everybody else.
Magisters... Voidwoken... never would&apos;ve drawn the dots that way...
*Say there might be some as yet unaffected...*
Pay Doctor Daeva a visit.
I&apos;ll stay here, if it&apos;s all the same, until my job is done.
*She pats your shoulder awkwardly.*
GUARDS! BURN HIM! BURN HIM NOW!
*Say you aren&apos;t interested in joining their little gang.*
Indeed I am. They can close our schools, but they can&apos;t take away what I&apos;ve been taught. Besides, there&apos;s still so much to learn...
*His smile is like a conquest; his chest - swiftly moved against yours - a battalion ready to breach.*
*Scream for the demon to go to hell and die.*
Shoes
*Cup her breasts and kiss them.*
*She sips from her cup, and you bow in farewell.*
