They&apos;ve sent one of those spores to Arx! &lt;i&gt;Right to headquarters &lt;/i&gt;- you have to warn them!

The Essence of Existence, Volume Two&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&apos;The Gods guide our every twitch and twirl,&apos; the devout tell us. Yet they also tell us that the Seven themselves are guided by the Tapestry of Time, where all of existence is written in the most indelible of inks. Are we to believe that who we love, what we speak, and where we journey is determined by an unknown hand, and policed by unknown enforcers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impossible. Within this universe we inhabit, where fruit falls from its tree to the ground and not into the skies; where the sun lights the days and the moon our nights; in that place, we are free to act of our own will wherever the laws of the wind and thunder allow it.
*You&apos;ve decided you don&apos;t want anything to do with this. Refuse to shake his hand.*

*Ask what comes next.*
Nobody knows every step of the way to Lucian&apos;s tomb, but I&apos;ll do what I can for you. First, you must get past the Path of Blood. An amulet filled with Source paired with the Scroll of Atonement will let you by unharmed.
Poor kitty. I salute you, puss!
Help me. Please.
Fascinating. And it told you exactly where to find it? The histories are &lt;i&gt;wildly &lt;/i&gt;incomplete. But now I have a better picture of how Anathema came to be.
Just when I thought I&apos;d heard every silly story, you come up with another! Come on. Prison&apos;s waiting!
Magister Barracks
And how many would make it before the guards noticed? Four? Five? Every bloody Sourcerer in this place? No... they&apos;ll have to take their own chances. I need one accomplice, no more.
Frozen makes target unable to move or act, but target gains armour and fire resistance.
[DWARF] *Ask where the eaglemaster is; dwarven custom demands one.*
Lucian was alive! With him was Dallis - and the resurrected Braccus Rex. Lucian demanded our Source to save the world from the Void.

My congratulations on becoming the singular Godwoken to follow the ancient rituals of the Arena. You are now... the &lt;i&gt;One&lt;/i&gt;.
I can&apos;t. The work&apos;s too delicate to do one-handed *Sigh.* I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m not accustomed to being so &lt;i&gt;bloody &lt;/i&gt;useless.
Ooooh! Ten-oh bottles o&apos; mead, oh...
For &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are the truth. &lt;i&gt;We &lt;/i&gt;are the real.

*The House of Shadows? Say that surely that house is a myth!*
*Say he has mistaken you for someone else and ask after the elf he&apos;s talking about.*
Lucian slaying Damian.
Lovely instrument, that. I could go all night with that little incentive at my beck and call.
*He closes his eyes. He&apos;s motionless for a moment, as if listening for music that only he can hear. And then, almost imperceptibly, his hips begin to sway...*
S-s-s-so c-c-cold!

*Nod: They should proceed with the exorcism. It is time.*
I don&apos;t have the time or the means to recover our trunk from the boat, but you&apos;re welcome to it if you can.
*The lizard looks about to make sure no-one else can hear, leans in and whispers conspiratorially...*
The other side? I CAN&apos;T &apos;OVE &apos;Y HEAD! Just don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest. That&apos;s all I care a&apos;out.
He prays. Such unfaltering faithfulness. A pity the Gods aren&apos;t listening.
Alexandar is dead. &lt;i&gt;Again.&lt;/i&gt; Let&apos;s hope we&apos;ve seen the last of him this time.
Such a talented young Sourcerer. In better times, he might have been a famous healer. A leader. But the Magisters have driven our kind into the shadows.
Let me show you.
Roll-call of Fallen Seekers
Ha! You&apos;re about as pretty as the south end of a northbound baboon! Pay up.
You must look within. You use but a fraction of your tremendous power, but you must unlock the rest. And then...

*Looking up you see Zorl-Stissa, staring down at you from a throne of embers. Above her is the emblem of a sun, once aflame but now dim and fading.*
A humble and steadfast vegetable.
Agents of the God King seek her relentlessly. There is no hiding place safe enough for her in the material realm. Only in the Dream can she rest.
Exactly. Your dead body. My dead body. This place is dead. We can be together anywhere.

It was a time of selflessness and sacrifice in the face of our old enemy. It was an act of heroism... and a dreadful mistake. A mistake we must rectify.
Hmm. They could be worse. Although they could certainly be better...
We cannot drag that chest back to Arx, but if you can salvage it, you&apos;re welcome to whatever&apos;s there.
The champion of the Gods, guardian of the Source and fiery scourge of the Void, Lucian is a legend without equal.
*She reaches for your cheek and harshly traces your scar with her thumb.*
Hail, stunning creature. Call me Dorotya.
A demon feasts on fear, but is never prone to apprehension. Unless...? I wonder...
But you didn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt;.
Arx is a tomb for all who stay - I just know it. Hervett must see sense; there&apos;s happiness and safety for us elsewhere.

Well done.
By the Seven, that was something! What&apos;d I tell ya? Not a scratch *wince* on me! None that&apos;ll last, at least. Glad my little guy got to see it.
Forcing her to remain sworn makes us no better than the God King. Let her go, and give her the scythe.&lt;br&gt;

The most recent entry, however, is dated from several years ago.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isbeil is most unhappy, and I can&apos;t blame her. She says her Blackpeak Isle laboratory was vital to her current research, but there&apos;s no way to finish her work now that the place is drowning in Deathfog. As it stands, I must reluctantly minimise the dwarven presence at Blackpeak Isle. I have tried to assure her that she can continue her work elsewhere, but she remains inconsolable.
[VILLAIN] *Tell the Magister that you love killing Sourcerers as much as they do.*
I see the good in you, the bad in you, the all of you.
You must make haste. I am bound, but not defeated. Not yet...

She&apos;s worried that he may have learned about the Blackpits operation.]
*He stands before you and pokes you in the side, seizes your shoulder with a great, strong hand.*
To be sure, chief! Pay up and you get to keep your eyes. Sounds pretty satisfyin&apos;, don&apos;t it?
Second of all: that tinkerer or weaponsmith or whatever-she-was wasn&apos;t knittin&apos; a sweater. That thing was made to kill dwarves, and I was made to smash it.
