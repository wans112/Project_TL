Only as often as I need his guidance, Godwoken.
I bet the elf&apos;s blood tastes like honey. Like nectar. Like joy itself.
You don&apos;t have the gold to pay me what I&apos;m worth.
*Leave it alone.*
We failed.
Best of luck to you!
Broilers
So, chief... I guess this is it. Right?
Can you see it?
I&apos;m sorry... there aren&apos;t any melee fighters to spare.
It&apos;s quite beautiful here. But I&apos;m afraid my journey to the sanctuary might have been in vain.
Bone Cuirass
This is what I get for putting my faith in a leader with the spine of a sponge. Thank Duna, Her Majesty has more steel in her belly than that coward.
Kemm&apos;s Notes about Dallis
*The Well of Ascension? Say you once heard an old story teller speak of it as the birthplace of gods.*
There, I held up my end of the bargain. I did as you asked, and now I&apos;m getting as far from this cave as my bones will take me.
Well, I&apos;m a rat. And you&apos;re some kind of... hm... curious, large-style flesh-beast. Never the twain shall mix, thus spaketh the reddish large-style flesh-beasts!
Lifeboat
*Look around. What is this place?*
Maisie!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ve been stationed with the most amazing guy: Jhad is his name. He&apos;s just perfect, everything I&apos;ve ever hoped for!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&apos;re on a mission now to negotiate with some Magisters regarding their views on Sourcerers. You know me, it boils my blood to argue for our basic rights with those tyrants. Jhad and I had a long conversation about it the other night, and we&apos;re like two peas in a pod with our views - I&apos;ve finally found the perfect person!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ll be sending this letter after our sortie, and will write another one if (when!) I have more news to share about Jhad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until then,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donna
Ha! Don&apos;t make promises you can&apos;t keep, filth! We deal with your disgusting kind very eagerly in Fort Joy. Soon I&apos;ll use them pretty claws of yours as toothpicks. He-he-*HACK!*
Elaborate Cage Key
Return if you have a change of heart. Even the Divine accepted help when the winds howled loudest.
Magisters! HERE?
&apos;itch. Total &apos;itch at that.
*Master? Ask who she&apos;s talking about.*
GREETINGS LORD AND LADY KEMM - BENEFICENT AND VENERATED
Oh, then do I have a story for you!
*With a jerk, your mind is pulled to a beautiful palace court. It&apos;s filled with cheers, but you can feel the fear dripping from the walls.*
Fane... join us, join us, join us...
Come, Lohse. After all we&apos;ve been through, you must know better than to cross me like this. You&apos;ve seen what I&apos;ve done to those who test my patience.
*Say you&apos;d like to order a drink.*
We held them off this time. The Voidwoken. Don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll hold them off again.
Well now you done it. Poor girl needed a butterfly&apos;s touch, &apos;n&apos; you wallop her with a sledgehammer. Just &apos;cause I&apos;m a Beast don&apos;t mean I&apos;m not gentle.
&apos;til next time, you animal.
*Ask what he&apos;s doing.*
*The vision fades...*
Whaddya want? Boss is &lt;i&gt;busy&lt;/i&gt;.
Bandit Thug
But... what about the ladder? It&apos;s right over there. You can go straight down!
*Despite the precariousness of your situation, you notice something that remained undetected in the gloom of the ship: a flaw in her diamond features. A curiously shaped scar on her left cheek.*
It is prey that look backwards, that wallow in pity. I am a hunter. I look forwards.
Earth Resistance Potion
But just like you, I hope we&apos;ll find ourselves facing a better future. I daresay we deserve it.
Divinity suits you. Though I know of one it might have suited even better...
*Muse that what doesn&apos;t kill us makes us stronger.*
Earthquake
*The ghost tries to pick up his mug again, fumbles, and stares at it in confusion.*
*As you move closer, you can see that the skin on his hand is midnight black. It seems to undulate, as if worms were squirming through his flesh.*
Temple of Amadia
Xssrsx, x!srk. Rxsr srx, sr!x srsk-x. Hmph, maybe you don&apos;t speak Ancient. What I mean is... I&apos;m very tired. Unless you have a bit of... never mind. Excuse me.
*He staggers and falls back away from you, misery overwhelming his devastated face. Slumped to the ground, he buries his head in his hands.*
[IFAN] *Remark that these wounded are a liability.*
The Mother permits you to leave.
Tough Two-Handed Sword
With the look of molten midnight, chaotic sooty particles whirl and dance around this weapon that contains shards of the Void.
Flaming Tongues
*Ask the dog if she isn&apos;t lonely here all alone.*
*Wonder if someone so enamoured with tea has call to question another&apos;s drinking habits.*
Lizard Survivor
Get lost, short stuff. I&apos;m busy.
*Cough and ask if the ground is really as interesting as all that.*
Can&apos;t start the game because we need a valid level and game mode selected!
Decaying Torso
This must be the egg thief!
And you threw it away.
Praise Duna for his blessing, and praise his mortal messenger. A throne still awaits our queen - and a new home awaits me, I&apos;d like to think.
Don&apos;t look like one of Lohar&apos;s. You real, or am I dreamin&apos;?
I&apos;m sure you&apos;re nice and all, at least when the mood strikes ya. But I&apos;d rather chat with your leader, if you don&apos;t mind.
*Tell her you&apos;ve already spoken to Gareth.*
*Ask Ifan if he knows anything about where you&apos;re headed - Fort Joy.*
Hear ye! Hear ye! Stranger threatens kid! Town crier unhappy!
[RED PRINCE] *Say that you are, if her gift is worthy of &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Equipped
*The air around you glows with sudden heat. Specks of ash fall from the sky, summoning a fractured memory.*
This is really between me and my best friend Lohse. Better stay out of this, Jahan.
Yow disappoint me, mistress. The God King shall hear of this. &lt;i&gt;Yore thralls must fight with us.&lt;/i&gt;
Forrex
I&apos;ve... done enough damage. To the valley, to the people here. To my family...
Some of us haven&apos;t got anyone at all anymore.
You mind?
Higba told us that he knows powerful Sourcerers - the kind who could help us to master our powers. He&apos;ll tell us all that he knows, if we help him escape.
*He tears another page from the book and tosses it into the air. It dances out to sea in the wind.*
This place hasn&apos;t been secured.
*Tell her you still feel him there, inside you. Ask if she&apos;ll help you finish him.*
Recipe for Cursed Poison Flask
Find the arena.
*Tell him that&apos;s neither your business nor his.*
&apos;Distraught&apos; don&apos;t even begin to cover it. She&apos;s hollerin&apos; after that child of hers -  killed by a Voidwoken, she was! Been dead and buried for a month now. Never even stepped foot in Fort Joy.
*Nod, saying you&apos;re always willing to cut a deal, if the terms are to your liking...*
Purging Wand
*Ask why she&apos;s looking for him.*
Driftwood, of course. Little fishing village. Not very welcoming, but you&apos;ll brighten it up, I&apos;m sure. Got family near there. Not the adventuring types. For the best, really.
Life will taste good again, once the God King&apos;s victory is sealed.
*Challenge the priest. Has Beast offended him in some way?*
[ELF] *Offer a prayer to Tir-Cendelius for the repose of Sarias&apos;s soul.*
*Say she had better answer, or there will be hell to pay.*
No touching, please!
*Her eyes lock with yours for a moment. She places her head on her knees and sits quietly.*
You won&apos;t believe it. (She won&apos;t believe it, Mabel. She&apos;ll think we&apos;re mad cows.)
*Say you two can surely find an arrangement.*
Look it in the eyes... Now do you see? &lt;i&gt;It hungers!&lt;/i&gt; And you&apos;re about to be its first meal...
What miracle is this? Amadia truly astounds me. Be welcome to our sanctuary. May you find comfort here.
*Reach out and touch the stone hem of his robes.*
Manifests a Magic Mirror in the Arena of Fort Joy, along with a new Character Creation level. This allows you to respec before moving on to the next act of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this is a persistent modification that cannot be turned off once activated.
That mission was ours. Now we mussst find another way to ssserve our Sssallow massster. I sssuggessst you do the sssame.
Why did you leave the Order?
We, the Queen of the World, smile upon thee with favour!
...I mean - okay, look, if you want something else, go to Bloodmoon Island.
As we were to be purged, Braccus betrayed Lucian and Dallis. He&apos;s a vessel for the God King.
Look after the child.
Consider me to be a gift - from Malady. My wood was splintered, but my spirit intact. It was a great feat, but given her skill, not a surprising one.
A very large-sized potion that restores your vitality. It makes a soft, tinkling sound when you shake it.
Corrosive Flower
I do hope you&apos;re ready, Lohse?
Sergeant Zrilla
*Is it really so unsafe around here? Ask Han what he knows about these swamps.*
We made it... we &lt;i&gt;actually made it!&lt;/i&gt; I owe you, stranger. More than you&apos;ll ever know.
*Insist she take cover. These aren&apos;t ordinary creatures.*
(Shh. Keep your voice down.)
*With every impact, a surge of adrenaline rushes through your veins. You feel no pain. You feel &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;. It is glorious.*
*Whispers...* When the wind blows from over the stweam, I can hear the Meista.
*Nod your head excitedly. Yes? And?*
Large Frost Rune
*Tell her you have bad news. Gareth is dead.*
*The Red Prince peers into the mirror&apos;s depths. A vision coalesces... it is Sadha, the Prince&apos;s true desire!*
We have gathered today to see justice done. If you have parting words to our once-comrade, speak them now.
Blessed Electrified Blood
*Sob*
Former Void weapon used by Roost
Add arrows
I see you... &lt;i&gt;hmmph...&lt;/i&gt;
Resurrected
The Mother, the Master... We&apos;ll see. It is not a decision for today.
Character Creation Zoom out
Humanoids
I am all right. I hold my deal as you hold yours.
Hilga
Never! Who knows if I&apos;ll ever have a chance like this again...? I won&apos;t squander it!
In truth, it does not matter in the least who you really are. You caught me off guard: you could have harmed me.
Icy flurries and the air thrums... could it be Slane?
&lt;b&gt;You cannot hide from me, Godwoken. And neither can &lt;i&gt;she. &lt;/i&gt;You are marked for death, and marked for Void. And I will come soon to reap my harvest!&lt;/b&gt;
Rename
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
No wonder you ridiculous creatures keep dying...
Sometimes good people do bad things. And there are consequences to every action.
*Three owls in the enclosure stare you down blankly, fluffing their feathers and blinking in turn.*
Dead? Pfft, who&apos;re you trying t&apos;fool, mate?
You don&apos;t believe in pixies, do you? Well, all that matters is whether they believe in you. And their very belief is the secret ingredient often used in crafting items that require just a pinch of magic.
*Lunge at him.*
*Say you&apos;re fine - but ask her to take the lute from your pack by herself.*
Thunder &amp; Rain Indoors 04
...it is a holy act.
A lovely little promise to make. A &lt;i&gt;thorny&lt;/i&gt; one to keep.
*Ask about this Sourcerer.*
*The girl breaks down in tears and buries her face in the sand, pitifully trying to escape your presence.*
The Chronicler&apos;s spirit recovered the original design for the Devourer armour for the Outlaw Empress. She sacrificed him to the armour when it was complete.
Cellar Hatch
That&apos;s a price I can agree on.
*Beast looks left, then right, then down, unsure if his compliment hit its mark.*
Voidwoken Deep-dweller
Tired of the view in here yet?
Wyvlia, the tavern cook, admitted killing and cooking the Magisters.
Well...
