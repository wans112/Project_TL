Nowhere in this world is safe. The people of this world do not take kindly to bare bone. Thus, I find myself seeking a face.
Think you&apos;re cute, do ye, dwarf? Business is business; even the Magisters know that. Get shoppin&apos; or leave me be.
There must be some way to get this ship moving, there &lt;i&gt;has &lt;/i&gt;to be.
*Draw your weapon and be done with him.*
Hit_Melee_Std_4
*He fishes out his pipe and tries to spark it alight with some flint. His trembling hands make it difficult work. He shoves the pipe back in his pocket.*
*Tell him he could have mentioned he&apos;s a hunted man. Puts you in danger as well!*
Character is invulnerable and Vitality is restored each turn.
Forget Skill
[IFAN] *Refuse to murder for him. You&apos;re not a common thug to be ordered about by some dandy.*
Character receives bonus damage based on missing Vitality.
*As you approach the relic, your Source collar grows tighter and tighter, burning and squeezing your neck*
You shine Lucian&apos;s light upon us. Praise be!
Grants additional mobility skills to a summon.
Curse their hides, I&apos;m falling back to Fort Joy. I won&apos;t die in this ruin for the sake of one Seeker.
Climbable Bricks
*The spirit disappears soundlessly.*
This note, written from one Magister to another, warns the recipient about Dallis&apos; powerful advisor.

*Ask what else is going on.*
*She opens her mouth to respond but stops dead. Her head jerks from side to side, searching for something unseen.*
Magical Padded Leggings
Ranged Weapons
Woolfe? I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any Woolfe. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
It&apos;s everything to do with the Paladins! You sully the Divine&apos;s name with this place!
You&apos;re as bad as the rest of &apos;em! A pox on you and every dwarf in Driftwood!
*Take your farewell.*
Where IS he?
Scounnnnndrel!
Spirit of Master Tremly
Brother,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The elves came again, looking for their rain amulet. We need it for the harvest, so I had to get rid of them. I&apos;ve hidden it in case any more of them come looking. I&apos;ve marked the spot. Tell no-one.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;P.
Malachite
*Insist that you&apos;re no jailor: you&apos;ve nothing to do with their imprisonment.*
I will keep my eye on you, in spite of this recent failure.
Statue Base
*...into your mouth... your tongue turns dry... then rough... almost &lt;i&gt;scaly, &lt;/i&gt;and you feel your Source... unsettled, as if attracted to the man&apos;s black eyes...*
*Fold your arms and watch. Alexandar had this coming to him.*
*Question the urge. What is there to gain by freeing Windego?*
That&apos;s not a risk we can take. Even if the chances of finding him are slim, we must keep searching!
Please. Leave me. I mean no harm. Not anymore.
A rune of magic, bone engraved; The cold of death must meet the bane; Of venom pure, a poison vial; Create the rune that&apos;s most reviled.
Syncing cloud...
*You&apos;ll speak of love later. Whisper that you want to taste her first.*
It&apos;s most intriguing. A message from the House of Shadows. The ones who so fruitlessly sent assassins after my good self.
Roost knew we were coming. It was a trap.
Forgotten Cell
Captain Kalwyn
I must look a mess. Like my ship was attacked and sunk by Voidwoken.
I did not seal myself in this tomb! I did not cast aside my life so I may fool some pathetic little creature millennia later.
*For a few moments his hand hangs motionless in the air, then is withdrawn with a swift and determined finality.*
How very right you are!
So fret not, but revel in the promise of the lake! Even without my guidance you have become a true Master of the Source. You are ready, and I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have something else to teach you...
Not mad. Practical. We are at war. I don&apos;t relish knowing there will be... civilian casualties. But they are necessary. The Order soon comes for the Dwarven Kingdom. Consider it a... pre-emptive strike.
My thanks for your help. Please, report to Magister Carver at the barracks beside the tavern. He&apos;ll want to hear there are still brave souls in this town.
*They embrace, lips hot upon lips.*
*A lizard, tall and beautiful, turns towards you. She fixes you with a sultry look, and when she speaks it&apos;s like listening to honeyed smoke.*
&lt;i&gt;...you did?!&lt;/i&gt; TO ARMS! Kill this one!
Take control of the Lady Vengeance.
*He bites his lip and shuffles away with an embarrassed whimper.*
Hah! Removed your collar like disobedient dog, I see! A very stout, very ugly dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
*Ask what the hells is going on here.*
I&apos;m quite taken aback. I knew she wanted to help us, but I didn&apos;t know she&apos;d go to such great lengths...
[JESTER] *Shrug and say that perhaps you&apos;re wrong, but something about the mysterious stranger with the flimsy story sets you on edge.*
Mahalia
*Ask about the priest in the other room. She seems - colourful.*
Trousers of the Thaumaturge
Pompous human arse. *Spits*
We&apos;re not blind, you know. We watched as you crept around our city.
And how many years did it take for her to see a single truth in a mess of lies? There&apos;ll be another, and another. She will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be played the fool!
Silly. It&apos;s not that big a secwet.
*Continue searching the ship.*
Treasury of the One
Well, never mind... I didn&apos;t do much to help him either, but I&apos;m d-damn glad he&apos;s back! I hope he found those Source weapons, then we might stand a chance out there...
Awake and travelling with a five year old apparently!
Bah! Most vulgar, most repellent &lt;i&gt;deception&lt;/i&gt; that seeks to bend the will with feeble force.
*Say you&apos;ve changed your mind.*
You think to try a bribe? I&apos;ve had it with talk. Pay for your crimes!
Now, where were we. Ah yes, defending my title!
You boil my blood, then think to walk away? The indignity fans the flames!
Of course, I&apos;d much appreciate it if we manage to find a Dreamer first.
[NOBLE] *Nod happily. It&apos;s good to see they maintained proper etiquette, even back then.*
Certainly.
Magister Holind
*He sighs.*
Succeed, and perhaps you can join me inside the Council. There we can see who shall be the next Divine, once and for all.
You&apos;re the slave here - enslaved by a life without Divinity in your heart. Embrace it. Abandon your wickedness.
Spit up to three projectiles dealing [1] , each creating a blood surface under the target.
Now, like I said, please kindly bugger off.
*Hold up your palm. No need.*
Please, I&apos;m sorry, but you must leave! My baby&apos;s terrified of lizards... she may be hiding from you even now! Erma? Erma, darling, are you here? Please, sweetheart, where &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;you?
I&apos;m getting paid. Ain&apos;t &lt;i&gt;stuck &lt;/i&gt;anywhere. Keep your hands off the merchandise, or you&apos;ll be hearing from me.
Perhaps gang leader Griff will know some way to escape.
About friendship... and enmity... and the fine line between them.
&lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt; You speak like a Magister. The spores are meant for life, not death.
*Ask him what he thinks of the new world that you helped usher into existence.*
*Sir Lora takes a slow, deep breath and lets it out in a rush.*
*Tell him his own Paladins allowed you in here.*
The air buzzes with Source here.
Hannag&apos;s Ring
Adrenaline
Oh, but you&apos;re a clever one, &apos;Beast&apos;, aren&apos;t you? Fine - you&apos;ve outed me. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
It certainly took it long enough. Where to begin...
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without finding the elves.
*Say that there&apos;s no point - better to just end her suffering now.*
Long-Buried Bowman
You&apos;re still here being ugly, I see. No offence, etc.
*The Sallow Man? Ask her if that&apos;s his real name.*
May your god ever watch over you.
*Consume the Seaman&apos;s Source.*
Camera Center
*Laugh. Bitterly. You&apos;ve called for death yourself, and now it dogs your heels.*

*Say you were... jealous. Jealous of Sadha...*
*&apos;Weaknesses of the heart&apos;, he said. But what about Sadha? And yourself? Isn&apos;t he quite prone as well?*
Look... I have an idea. I know we don&apos;t know each other very well, but time is so short and... and a connection is so rare. If we get out of here, will you meet me again in Arx?
You and me both, mate. You and me both. You know what the funniest part is? The shop is still open. You believe that? The shop&apos;s still open! Go on, do your shopping!
I&apos;ve seen this... seen Deathfog in action. Such horror has no place in this world.
Never mind. The One does not ask such a question.
The illusion of choice, remember? &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll remember.&lt;/i&gt;
Have I not shown enough devotion? Consume me, champion! Consume us all!
Report back to Malady.
Doubt it!
Hammered Scale Pants
None of us are perfect, sir.
&apos;An acorn is not the answer. But it may be close. Closer than a chicken, at least. Answer search continues...&apos;
Remember the pact.
Narin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have served me well in the past, you will do so again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use the scroll included with this letter and cast it in a public square in Arx. You will be arrested for Source use and shipped to Fort Joy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the island, you will search for a red-skinned lizard. You will kill him. You will cut the body to pieces. You will ensure no magic in the world can restore him back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have your orders. Your weight in gold awaits you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck, and good hunting.
If they were all working for the Black Ring - and I believe they were - there must be some sign of it in this building. Perhaps even a safe house.
*Leave the child be.*
*Suddenly, her grip tightens around you. She&apos;s holding you hard - too hard. Hard enough to crush you. Her lips remain locked on your hardened mug. You try to pull away, but she won&apos;t let go.*
Step back from the prisoner! You are interrupting a Paladin court, stranger.
*Admit you&apos;ve never tried that. Ask if it&apos;s even possible.*
*Tell her that the Voidwoken spoke to you. You don&apos;t know what it means, but it seems important.*
...and you were well rewarded for that! I taught you how to be like &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. What more could anyone want?
Speak with my master. Speak, do his bidding, and &lt;i&gt;leave&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell him you don&apos;t remember asking for his help.*
Praying at an altar once more, I heard the voice speak in the faintest of whispers.
The elven seer Saheila was held captive by the Lone Wolves. We must lead her from the sawmill.
[JESTER] *Mutter that from the painting, you thought it might be a pig wedding.*
I did the only thing I could do: I appealed to our old champions of the House of Dreams and fled here, into a world untouchable by our foes.
At last! This fire won&apos;t sink any more ships.
*Tell him that cutting down Ancestor Trees is a terrible crime.*
*The Meistr goes quiet for a moment, staring at the gashes that criss-cross her body.*
The spirit of Brother Morgan, jailer to a possessed little girl, asked us to help her.
Return to the Paladins.
No. I&apos;m only bad when the occasion calls for it, darling.

*Her work is an abomination. Do not suffer her to live.*
Team Score:
An &lt;i&gt;elf &lt;/i&gt;viewing the mind of Consul Zara? How... unseemly.
*The dog lies there, clearly still in pain.*
*Bow your head. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath... and call to her.*
Well, now. Then all my painstaking efforts haven&apos;t been in vain.
