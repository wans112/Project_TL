But it doesn&apos;t matter. I will continue to care for you, to love you, no matter what you think.
Report the find to Lagan.
If you need anything, I&apos;ll be in Driftwood.
I used my power to restore the Eternals, free of the God King. Will harmony reign over Rivellon? Time, as always, will tell.
&lt;i&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ll come up for air when the coast is clear.
Although, much as I despise the creature, I have never known her to be a coward.
Oh my love. What have they done?
I doubt it&apos;s the correct use of the term &apos;irony&apos;, but it&apos;s certainly something.
What is this place?
*An older couple is crouched behind a cart, exchanging sharp whispers.*
*You slowly return to your senses, the smell of damp death filling your nostrils. You see that a crude sun pictograph has been hacked into the altar&apos;s rock*
I... I don&apos;t know. I was just trying to save my own skin - there wasn&apos;t time to put much thought into it.
*A shudder of pleasure wracks the figure in the door. It seems to breathe. All of a sudden, all anguish is gone. It gives you the sternest of looks.*
You&apos;re the challenger that Murga took down, aren&apos;t you? Don&apos;t take it to heart, stranger - plenty of good fighters have been humbled by her before...
*Lie and say it probably feels worse than it is.*
And you... I couldn&apos;t trust &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; with Divinity.
Again! This time I&apos;LL find YOU!
*Ask her when she died - recently?*
*You see the soul of a lizard - a proud father, a humble man. He senses the intent in you, your finger twitching, perhaps to snuff out his flame forever. He understands why; he accepts your decision.*
*The trinkets he mentioned sound intriguing; inquire as to what he has to sell.*
And it&apos;s a courtesy I&apos;d like to extend to ya, I surely would - if it weren&apos;t so dangerous with all them Reds around!
Dallis. Who do you think? She&apos;s a smart cookie, but she&apos;s gotten careless since that new advisor&apos;s been twisting her ear.
A rare delicacy, fit for royalty... I shall eat it.
*Assent. Ask what you can do for him.*
Get the hell away from me! No- no!

*Remark that the old maxim says the ferryman shouldn&apos;t be paid until the end of the journey.*
What&apos;s to tell? A noisy gang of dwarves dragged an excessively large gang of crates in, and neither one ever left! Rude.

Spring. Gentle, so that the others may be strong. The fallen quench the soil with their blood, and hasten the rebirth. Death becomes life, as is our way.
My, but that does me good to hear. I was worried they&apos;d catch up with her quick, after what happened here...
[FANE] *Do they want your sympathy? Snap that they should have known better than to disobey their lord.*
Fat chance! I&apos;d wrassle Death to the ground &apos;n&apos; make &apos;im scream my name &apos;fore I&apos;d set a dainty toe in the Hall of Echoes. All you did was save the bastard a good beat-down!
You are in the books. You are invited. Do not keep the Doctor waiting.
*Your struggle is countered by the manipulations of a huge, invisible hand. It toys with you like a doll.*

Your price is good. It buys you my silence.

Now &lt;i&gt;that&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;what I call a captain.
*The squirrel and the cat both look at you, their stares unforgiving.*
*Ask her to trade.*
*The creature eats as ravenously as before. You look closer at his victim and notice the corpse&apos;s small size. His meal... is a child.*
*Even in death the spirit of Karon, the great Mistake, is lost in insanity.*
*Inform him that you found a cache of Source weapons hidden in the fish factory. Show him one as proof.*
Heh. Even in death, she&apos;s a crafty sort.
[OUTLAW] *You know that name very well. They say he&apos;s swiped enough property from the Dwarven Royal Fleet to buy a small island.*
*Nod and be on our way.*
Even when you can&apos;t see me, I&apos;m always watching you...
Your Griff teaches you to bully others. Pathetic.
*Tell him you&apos;re clearly an elf, and he&apos;s clearly an idiot.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell her she&apos;s panicking. Tell her to match your breathing. In. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Out. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.*
I&apos;m listenin&apos;.
I enjoyed it very much.
*The rat gives you a malevolent stare.*
*You both dress. Sebille fishes some dice from her pocket.*
Side with the Magisters.
Haha! I am almost tempted to answer - just to watch as you hear it. But no, that was not part of our bargain.
Did you answer?

One of us consumed the Source of Brother Kalvin&apos;s spirit, ending his control over the lever that controls the inner chamber of the vault.

Oh that&apos;s not so nice. Not so nice at all.
Well, that&apos;s one word for her, I guess. She came after... after the troubles started. And then the others. This actually used to be a school, if you can believe it.
We thank you again. We bless you again. The dregs of the depths are yours.
Fresh, sweet, and icy-cold.
*Drain him of his Source. Condemn him to the Void.*
I&apos;m happy for you, Geraldine. Really.
*You shake your head, your mind stumbling. Your childhood was nothing like that...*

If you need me, I&apos;ll be in the Black Bull. Downstairs, naturally.
Doesn&apos;t it just?
You faced Voidwoken, then. They come...
Your Highness. Bloom of Duna, Flame of the Forge. I present to you: the Seed of Divinity.
Get the hell out of here. I&apos;m done talking.

Well, you have nerve, I give you that. Can&apos;t give you a break for it, though. You take holiday in a prison cell.

You look like someone who&apos;s ready for business. You look like someone with an eye for the main chance. You look like someone who needs... an investor.
Not all who are chosen can bear it.
This isn&apos;t the moment for making enemies.
Be... wary. The urns will shatter. The bones will... rise.
It is all I can ask. Just know... he has his father&apos;s heart. He is ready to lead.
*Tell him you don&apos;t know what became of Delorus.*
The war-drums keep the rhythm of patrol...
Kiss. My. Feet.

She holds that wine glass as if it would never be empty. A good reminder; we must drink the wine today for tomorrow there&apos;ll be none.

*The creature murmurs a quiet poem. You recognise the language - it is that of the Eternal race.*
If you meet anyone like that aboard, maybe you could talk to her. Casually. See when she last spoke to Finn.
Thank you, for finding Gareth, stranger - I owe you... we all do. I just hope he&apos;s found what we need to get past the Magisters - then we might actually have a chance at surviving this!

*Tell her you want to help Gareth. He needs to know what happened.*
*Your god told you there can be only &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;. He said you&apos;ll eventually need to turn on each other...*
*Say that you&apos;re sorry to tell her, but you found his body. He was killed by Magisters.*
The results were horrifying. A double curse - turned into pigs, and set aflame for eternity. I like not being on fire, so I don&apos;t want to complain too much about the pig part.
Amadia&apos;s blessings on you! But pray, a moment.

You expecting a tip? Well here&apos;s one: soap. Use it.
&lt;i&gt;ENOUGH, shell. You struggle too much - I will find another vessel. Countless.&lt;/i&gt;
Criminal! Ready yourself!
Its blade patterned with nicks and scratches, this hefty gut-piercer is an excellent sidekick for bartering, threatening or general intimidation.
*Back away. You don&apos;t need this drama; you&apos;ve got plenty already.*
Are you ill-equipped for Lucian&apos;s Day? Let me help you with that!
*Shrug. You&apos;ll see what you can do. No promises.*

Great to have Gareth back. You&apos;ll see, now. We&apos;ll get that ship...

*Say that you are Godwoken, seeking knowledge to expand your powers.*
How could you be so cold-blooded?
The sun rose to its zenith, but there settled refused to descend towards the beckoning dusk. Instead she hung there for seven days and seven bright, starless nights: so enamoured was she with her little Red Prince.
For you... you will lead our kind back to divinity.
Hmm. Well. You&apos;re free to go for now. But I&apos;ve got my eye on you.
Hacking through enemies with this rudimentary farm tool would be a hard row to hoe indeed.

*Ahem!*
I can no longer communicate with my fellow ancestor trees, but I know that this Nameless Isle that you seek is the home of the Mother Tree - first among all of my kind.
*Beast leans into the kiss, then pulls away and caresses your cheek.*
No. No I suppose they don&apos;t, which is why I&apos;ve no intention of carrying out the death sentence that I should. Besides, you did come back for me and all those others on a sinking ship after all.
&lt;i&gt;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrraccus Rex!&lt;/i&gt; Gods damn &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; to this hell in which I suffer. Gods damn these burning flames!

Get away from me. I cannot bear to look at you.
*She sighs. Deeply.*
