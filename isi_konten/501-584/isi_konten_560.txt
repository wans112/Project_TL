These shabby pants are standard issue for all Sourcerers quarantined by the Divine Order. From the rips and bloodstains on this pair, you can conclude that you are not their first owner.
See ya. If I gotta.
Something doesn&apos;t feel right...
I care for the people of this city, I truly do. I brought them into our home so that I could hear from them - to let them know that their betters &lt;i&gt;listened &lt;/i&gt;to them.
Are you ready?
Then say it, if you would.
*Carnage follows. The surviving Magisters pursue you here, where you hope to meet a friend. A friend who keeps your secrets. You held them off, but then... the Magisters were helped. &lt;i&gt;You see yourself.*&lt;/i&gt;
Blessed Vulture Feather
Migo the Gheist gave us his ring.
H-h-halt! What word do you bring?
You... It is you... I have found you... Sebille... scarred one... vermin...
When your flunkies scream for revolution, I know what they&apos;re really screamin&apos; for, Beast. And I know it&apos;s dwarven blood bein&apos; shed.
Find the tombs of the four heroes.
*Say she seemed miserable.*
We continue - we go on!
You can&apos;t launch the game since you&apos;re not the owner of the lobby.
*If Tarquin is offended, it doesn&apos;t register on his face.*
[MYSTIC] *Ask him what he can see of the other side.*
*Ask if she knows how many missing spores remain.*
*Silly puppy. Consume his Source.*
*The cook bows slightly and wipes her hands on her gruel-stained garb.*
Bugger. This.
It is &lt;i&gt;so! &lt;/i&gt;But if you can&apos;t pay me in money, then I&apos;ll just have to insist you keep me on until you can. So. What position can you offer?
*Say you aren&apos;t sure... what does it have in mind?*
Seven preserve me, are you entirely ignorant, lizard?
Guess I should get outta here. But can&apos;t quite put one foot front of the other...
The things you&apos;re &lt;i&gt;insinuating &lt;/i&gt;about me require proof - and it seems as though you have none.
I refused the Mother Tree. I shall not take root. Elven hopes lie elsewhere now.
Godwoken... why do you aid these servants of the Void? Do you not know your purpose?
Your praise is my pride, Your Highness! Many long hours I have passed here, waiting for your royal self to break through the smoke.
They spent quite some time at it too. Apparently I was a rich vein to be mined. And now I hang powerless as any butchered carcass.
Backlash Skillbook
All that glitters is not gold... yet perhaps there may be some to be found within whatever this glittering key can open.
An astonishing display of might.
Sharp little minx, isn&apos;t she?
I don&apos;t give a toss. I have my own business to take care of.
I am a &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt;, ben-Mezd. And you... you always do just as you&apos;re told, don&apos;t you?
Sech Zapor took his soul in trade for an enchanted coat. He left in haste.
The Guardian Coif
*Gaze out to sea in silence.*
*Hold on! Ask who in the hells Roost is.*
*Well now that he mentions it, you are still wearing this Source collar...*
All past is past.. and stays... in &lt;i&gt;past. &lt;/i&gt;
He might be a greedy little junk peddler, and a &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer &lt;/i&gt;to boot, but hardly capable of seizing Magisters...
No matter &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;strongly I feel about you.
I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m fresh out. The yolk&apos;s on you! Get it? Yeah? Better than your &apos;peckish&apos; joke, anyway.
An occluding arrow was made from a recipe stolen from the chronicles of the Kallavi, an elusive troupe of burglars.
For wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful to be in love?
Source Blast
*Tell him to follow you.*
And why should a lion fight a pussycat?
Hard to know, what with &apos;y &apos;eing a head on a stick, I don&apos;t get all the news fro&apos; across the island. &apos;ut he had a lot of stuff hidden in a lot of... locations. We &apos;uilt a &apos;aze for hi&apos;...
Tovah, the leader of the elves at the encampment, is dead.
*He peers at it, then sheathes his weapon.*
*The faint spirit&apos;s voice is little more than a whisper, echoing inside your mind.*
Rain
*You slip your fingers between the armour&apos;s plates. With a quick pull, you remove a piece - as well as a chunk of the Magister&apos;s shoulder.*
Right good to see ya again, guv&apos;nor! Heard you&apos;re the new champion! Well done, I say!
*A thought suddenly enters your mind, though you&apos;re quite certain it isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;yours.&lt;/i&gt; You hear the voice of the thing in your head: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Do as she says.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
&apos;Here rests Timmus Anchoret.&lt;br&gt;Ever may he look out upon&lt;br&gt;The woods he loved so dearly.&apos;
Exploration
I don&apos;t look guilty.
*Say that you heard a report that an item like this had been stolen... though you must be mistaken.*
Go now, my child. Rivellon and its Masters await.
*Tell her your price is considerably higher than that.*
I&apos;ll find him. And the Divine help him when I do...
*Admit that you&apos;ve pushed your luck too far, and surrender.*
I&apos;m investigating the disappearance of Lord Arhu. Let me know if you hear anything.
He is the Master of the House of Shadows. He is a terror that breathes.
Anything&apos;s possible if you&apos;ve a mind to make it so. I&apos;ve rerouted my final destination twice now - they could&apos;ve done the same.
Hahahaha! Whee!
*Ask if there&apos;s anything you can do to help.*
Vydia&apos;s Buried Valuables
&lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;damn &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you didn&apos;t do it for him - you had your own battles to fight.*
You have accepted my Covenant. You are sworn to me. Heed my words and do my bidding.
It is done. I have brought &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;. Drink from the well of Source, my friend. I have been true to my word.
Hah! Collared like a dog! A very stout, very ugly dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
*The spirit throws his hands up to shield himself, but it&apos;s already too late.*
But... it&apos;s too late now.
*Blink and ask what it did to your eyes.*
[ELF] *Tell her you&apos;re ashamed of her. She needs to toughen up.*
Well, if it isn&apos;t the &lt;i&gt;new Divine&lt;/i&gt;, gracing me with her presence. *Smirks* How honoured I am...
Too true. But I&apos;m just sayin&apos;. We got Sourcerers and Voidwoken and murderers pollutin&apos; Driftwood...
We left the Nameless Isle. As far as we know, the temple is flooded still.
I am the guide of all souls bound to Duna! And you have damned them.
*He sighs deeply.*
*Tell them you suspect their friend isn&apos;t coming back.*
Here is a place of tranquility, where those of faith can gather together.
*Tell him the greatest reward he could give you would be a way off the island...*
*Salute solemnly and take your leave.*
Where to begin? A mad doctor, an evil influence, the queen&apos;s withered right hand. Should I go on?
&lt;i&gt;Fulton.&lt;/i&gt; Our business is our business. Remember what Carlevand told us.
Could you stop me? Really stop me? If it came to that...
It is time, Paladin.
*A wintry wind blows, and bitter hail falls all around you... yet you feel no chill, and the ice melts as soon as it touches your skin.*
Alright. But my eyes are on you.
*Assent. Yes - you will see it through.*
*Break into a laugh. Say your delicate sensibilities are feeling very insulted indeed.*
The demon is obsessed with purity.
I admire your persistence, Godwoken. Your actions are futile and utterly misguided of course... but it&apos;s impressive that you&apos;ve made it this far, nonetheless.
*Ahem!*
Chair
That is when I heard them.
Either you&apos;re joking or there&apos;s something very wrong with you. I&apos;m going to assume you&apos;re joking. Now...
Flesh Adaptation
*Ask who he&apos;s expecting.*
Confirm
&apos;Here lieth Jeffer.&lt;br&gt;First name unknown,&lt;br&gt;And of no further use.&apos;
I don&apos;t know. The men in red came with their big rolling box thing, and she told me to hide. She hasn&apos;t come back! Have you seen my mum, missus?
*The eagle&apos;s own eyes glitter with avarice.*
*Admit you have not.*
*Tell him you&apos;re looking for something a little more... sensual.*
The arch-demon is dead! Lohse is free!
Heresy! You - oh my. You&apos;re... &lt;i&gt;glowing.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Come. Embrace-&lt;/i&gt;submit-&lt;i&gt;embrace.&lt;/i&gt;
Deathfog Delivery Device
I think we should go home. Come on, Ben. Thanks, lady. Bye-bye.
Desert Dark
Reduces the damage from physical weapons.
[ELF] *Recite an ancient prayer of comfort. &apos;May the lost be confined not to memory, but guided safely home.&apos;*
This wand appears to be cut from still-living wood; tender shoots and fresh green leaves bud from the tip.
Spirit of Lawre Godfray
An entirely justified response! But I have a better idea, if you&apos;re willing to help?
I demand entry. You can&apos;t hide what you&apos;re doing forever!
...I want to say it was brave. Maybe it was. But it wasn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
*Lean in and whisper that her husband plans to kill her father.*
As I hung from the tree, I had a vision.
Evil lurks here. I can feel it in the very tip of my tail!
I got real lucky when the Voidwoken attacked. They didn&apos;t go anywhere near the Kemm estate. I know some people that lost &lt;i&gt;everything.&lt;/i&gt;
Fearlessness
Heh, was the day I&apos;d have to cut yeh just for asking. Don&apos;t suppose it makes much of a difference now...
*Lohse winks and curtsies in playful reverence. Her spectral gaze twinkles.*
No offence, of course.
[SOLDIER] *Offer to execute him, in the proper fashion.*
Drunk_2
*Ask what&apos;s going on here.*
Seek out the pirate captain.
Bloody bastard will never get my name right... I&apos;ve been under his command for almost a year!
*Say her armour matches a piece you found.*
Oh Fane, do not mistake pragmatism for glee. Of course I mourn - we are all family after all - but it is too late for them.
*The spirit doesn&apos;t register your presence at all. She wrings her hands as she looks down on her poor crushed corpse.*
[UNDEAD] *Tell him you&apos;re just someone, trying to get by.*
Crafting Bible, Part XIII
Shadow Quality:
*Say that the Seekers aren&apos;t bad - they just want to go home. If she helps them do that, she&apos;ll be free in no time.*
Last chance. Turn and walk away while you still can.
*Ask Beast what your next move should be.*
*Ask when.*
I mean, they doomed us all, didn&apos;t they? The son of the Divine is &lt;i&gt;dead!&lt;/i&gt; Gone! Who will save us now?
Likewise.
Well well, Godwoken! If I had known you would come seeking us out I would have saved myself quite some time and energy racing hither and thither across Rivellon.
Creg Ganim
Well, so much for that...
[1]% chance to bless surfaces
You think you can take a bite out of me?
A true elf knows that nature is a finer weapon than even the sharpest blade. The four seasons have served our people well. Four heroes rest before you; wielders of the seasons...
A winged messenger to a fading God.
The Adventures of the Hero
I welcome all.
No! &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;can&apos;t eat the fish. I need to properly observe its effects, and I can&apos;t do that if I&apos;m... well, if I&apos;m... &lt;i&gt;indisposed&lt;/i&gt;.
Hildur&apos;s Plate
It&apos;s better here than inside.
*Shake your head. It&apos;s not the time for stories.*
Hah. Not so clever, are you? Surprised you made it this far in life, with a mouth like that.
Cursed Cluster Grenade
Rid us of this curse!
Duna, God of Dwarves
Deathfog! I need to get out of here. Now!
Very well, I am open to this.
She just... showed up one day. When she knocked, we figured it must be time. The Order had come for me. But it wasn&apos;t a Magister who&apos;d called. It was a lizard. Not one red like you, mind.
What&apos;s this? It looks... strange...
*Scoff and tell him you&apos;re not lost at all. Quite on the contrary!*
You are interrupting a Paladin court, stranger.
