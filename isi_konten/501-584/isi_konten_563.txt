Why would I? We&apos;re not strangers, you and I. There&apos;s no-one in this world I know better than you. You are the secret of my soul, just like I am yours.
I can&apos;t believe it. After all that, Peeper&apos;s... &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;.
This is for only the Red Prince to know. Bring him before me, or leave my sight.

Did she regret her deal with the demon?

*The cook stares at you for a long moment, a dark hatred brewing in her eyes...*
*She gives you a long and steady look, as if it is the last time you shall see each other for the rest of eternity. Then she dips her chin in acknowledgement. You are almost her equal.*
*Her eyes narrow.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you&apos;d love to see this &apos;Griff&apos; fellow try such a thing.*
The last demon you summoned, for power&apos;s sake and for lust&apos;s sake: she was indebted to those who seek your demise. Of this we had no knowledge.
*Change your mind. This is too much effort, and you&apos;ve seen nothing to suggest she&apos;s the skilled Sourcerer that she claims to be.*

Come on, old man... I can&apos;t wait all day...
Good lines, yup - good lines. Sure it ain&apos;t true, all they say, but you know how it goes. Ya sing a song and pretty soon, it&apos;s on people&apos;s lips, spreadin&apos; like a rash on a lizard&apos;s tush-scales!

Oh - oh. Yes.
*He gives you the same unblinking look.*

Return to Lovrik&apos;s love-lizard.
*Tell him you&apos;ll tell the people what he did.*
[IFAN] *Say if he wants to fight with a Sourcerer, you&apos;re more than happy to oblige.*
The Gods - or &lt;i&gt;someone &lt;/i&gt;- must want that man kept alive. Perhaps we should see what he&apos;s up to.
*Tentatively greet the automaton.*
The wine was delicious - but not at this price.

All players have not finished their character preparation.
You are quite formidable, my chosen, but you underestimate just how much more formidable you could be!
You - you - you stupid mortal whelp!  You have no idea who you&apos;re dealing with. You have no idea what you&apos;re about to do!

You are no simple traveller. I can see the gods&apos; mark upon you, and my master has bid me return your kind to your gods.
Colleagues. Magisters from Driftwood, loyal to their bishop. Stanley, maybe. Brant, for sure. I was hopin&apos; Harrick would come along too. Very fond of &apos;er, I am, that Harrick.
Not drawin&apos; many winning cards of late, but I won&apos;t be cryin&apos; over it. Sailed away from my last island prison scot-free. No reason I can&apos;t do it again.

If such a coup was indeed a part of her plans, I can&apos;t but admire its execution. She&apos;s a clever girl, &apos;queen&apos; Dallis.
