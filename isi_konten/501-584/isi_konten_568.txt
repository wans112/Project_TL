*The lid of the urn shakes slightly, then creaks open. Within lies curled the limp and feathery form of Peeper.*
This large iron key has been embossed with the Magisters&apos; emblem, though you can see the sigil of the Divine partially obscured beneath it.
Source Rack
Indeed. Quercus and I will find an advantageous location and do just that. Meanwhile, you must prevent the servants of the Acorn from interrupting us.
Repairing failed. Repair level too low.
*Stay silent and let Red Prince do the talking.*
No - please. She&apos;s terrified of your kind. I don&apos;t know why. But if she sees you, she&apos;s sure never to return. Please, I&apos;m sorry but you must go. Erma? Erma dear, where are you?
Soft flesh for piercing... Warm blood for drinking...
*He gives you a strange look.*
Back away, longtail.
*Lie. Tell the cub you haven&apos;t seen its mother.*
Source &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. It is a constant, a subject of neither time nor transience. All of life is Source, and in Source it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. Immortally so.
Divinity.
There&apos;s... &lt;i&gt;n-ngggh&lt;/i&gt;... there&apos;s nothing you can do!
Sarias is a warrior, proud and true. Blood to blood. Earth to earth. Wood to wood. Birth to birth. Sarias becomes his tree. May Sarias take root.

We entered a vault beneath a blazing statue.

Magister Ranley, Caulker&apos;s Mate of the Divine Eminence vessel, &lt;i&gt;Lady Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt; That&apos;s all the information I&apos;m giving to any of you lot, so stow your questions, elf.
Alright then lover. &lt;i&gt;Let&apos;s dance.&lt;/i&gt;
Ask Sanders for Source amulet and the Scroll of Atonement.
[SOLDIER] *Their patrols are good, but not airtight. You can see at least three exfiltration points from here.*
*Scoff. The laws of his damnable empire have no validity here.*
Decreases the damage you take from non-magical weapons.
Memories fade to dust in sheep like you - even sheep that cannot die. But your Source... that does not fade.
[HERO] *Step forward and say that maybe they should just calm down a little.*
Thanks, I feel a lot better! Sure glad &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; made it here.
*Lean in and quietly tell him that you read his journal. You &lt;i&gt;know.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The Magister bristles. For a moment his hand twitches towards his sword, but he thinks better of it.*
*Grunt, and reach for your weapon.*
[JESTER] *Let out a snort. She sure would know about fantasies, wouldn&apos;t she?*
Suddenly, it all makes sense. Folks&apos;ll do anything to survive. Who could blame them?
*Shake your head. Deathfog? Things are looking mighty grim.*
Wind Deep Forest 02
*Say if that&apos;s the case, he ought to be even more understanding.*
I&apos;ll not be lured away from my post by some fork-tongued hearsay. Go and tell someone that gives a damn.
*Sigh* Indeed, the creatures that strut about this realm so often do.
Fiery Malediction
Journal
*The Magister sees you approach once more. He snarls at his underling:*
Yet somehow I will learn to live with it. If you can tolerate your own blighted conscience, then I can tolerate mine.
There&apos;s a vandal on the loose. Tell me what you know.
Go now, my darling Fane. Rivellon and its Masters await.
*Tell her she can&apos;t stay here; it isn&apos;t safe.*
Boletus
I can sense the expanse of Source inside you. You are ready to learn the spell I have yearned to teach you: the spell you will need when we reach the Well of Ascension.
For an attribute check to succeed, your attribute must surpass a certain value. A difficult task will have a higher requirement.
I got a bone t&apos;pick with this bastard, and you&apos;d have me pickin&apos; my teeth instead?!
You think I won&apos;t stand up for myself just because I make wonderful toys and fancies? &lt;i&gt;WRONG!&lt;/i&gt;
Fine. What happens next?
Smoke, blood, and carnage. The Magisters didn&apos;t spare a single Seeker.
Through fog we ride, through blood we wade in search of a name. A demon plots, but with his name we will bind him.
Shrine to Lucian
The world is without gods, but it is in need of one.
Magical Two-Handed Lucid Axe
Whatever form this &apos;Void&apos; takes, it seems significantly more dangerous than I assumed.
*Tell him you&apos;re no Divine Order loyal; he need not fear you.*
[UNDEAD] *Say you&apos;re not all you seem. She might not be interested in the real you.*
Exterminate the arch-demon Adramahlihk.
And I fear I am just as much use. I was a Master of Source once, but no longer. The Magisters&apos; purging staves saw to that.

But beware, they are found in a treasure vault, guarded by traps of a cunning not seen in a thousand years. They-

Translocate
&lt;i&gt;We... are... ETERNAL!&lt;/i&gt;
What is the meaning of this?
Gaze into the gem, my lovely girl.
I can deduct some recipes from this book, but this reads more like a puzzle than a recipe. I will have to experiment with what I can learn from these rhymes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fire with sharp things &lt;br&gt;And water what sea brings&lt;br&gt;Earth scrolls with blossoms &lt;br&gt;And air scrolls with cotton&lt;br&gt;Or other soft things you find on the roads&lt;br&gt;Combined with an essence, turns paper to scrolls.
Ah now, those beasts caught me off guard, but I&apos;m sure the likes of &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;will have no trouble with them at all.
Poor idiot...
*Say the Shadow Prince may have a point.*
Yes. Black as the grave.
*Nod at the beaten and bloody Magister at his feet. Such a sight speaks for itself.*
Nothing excites me more than being proven wrong! Now there&apos;s a whole new world of thinking to be done. I just need to figure out a way to jot down the notes from my last project when I can&apos;t hold a pen...
Yes, let&apos;s go and find the silly muggins that got themselves abducted.
Oh please, don&apos;t stare. It&apos;s tiresome.
This is what makes you such an abomination, you see.
Level [1]: +[2]% damage.
You good &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt;, good master!
The antlers of a deer&lt;br&gt;Are known for magical qualities&lt;br&gt;So being quite sincere&lt;br&gt;I know that you can bodily&lt;br&gt;Knock over your opponent&lt;br&gt;By shooting a sharpened chip&lt;br&gt;And he&apos;d lie there frozen&lt;br&gt;But only for a bit
Thanks to us, Rivellon will soon be... free.
Small Potion of Shadow
I am Tarquin. Consider me at your service.
*Say you have nothing new to share at this time.*
*Ask what happened here. How did the Seven come to such a fate?*
Perhaps then it truly speaks as the Ancestor Trees do. I find its spore-mates and see.
*You wrap one arm around her, and with the other, conjure a little ball of flame in your palm. Little more than a party trick, but her eyes fill with wonder nonetheless.*
*He motions to the devastation encircling you. Corpses. Blood. Oil. Fire.*
*Malady wearily chuckles to herself, then bows her head in a show of unexpected but sincere reverence.*
There are two ways to open this door. Find a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;key&lt;/font&gt; or find a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;lever&lt;/font&gt;.
Tortured Prisoner
Ah! Can do, can do! But struggle a bit would you? Turns me on.
*Then, deeper within the mechanism, the sound of gears turning and a bolt withdrawing...*
It&apos;s unbelievable, really - how someone with the power to become a god can be so incredibly naive.
Ah. You&apos;ve read my contract. What does that look in your eye mean?
*Remark that the Magisters seem to believe that the Aeteran is real - they&apos;ve been looking for it, in fact.*
*The squirrel grasps the acorn in its tiny paws and scuttles away.*
She&apos;s tuned me out. She&apos;s tuned everyone out - everyone but that advisor of hers, that Isbeil. Her quacking all but drowns us out.
Trade: Attitude
*Ask what Dallis told him about this place.*
Enemy
*Ask him to sniff you: do you smell good or bad?*
*Admit you kill - but only in self-defence.*
*Tell him he&apos;s suspiciously enthusiastic about you opening the chest.*
*Take her in your arms. Comfort her.*
A promising pile of cut potatoes, only a bit of hot oil away from perfection.
*His corpse rolls to a stop at the bottom of the pit. The elven leader stands and stares at her fallen comrade.*
*Snarl that you&apos;re not here to play games.*
You have my thanks, brother.
Darling, Gill works for Lohar. Everyone works for Lohar. Your stuff&apos;s Lohar&apos;s stuff now. Forget it. Think of it as an opportunity to get yourself new stuff.
Magister Herman
We fought in the arena and lost.
Oh, and if you meet a woman called Lohse, troublesome little Lohse: just kill her and be done with it.
(No you didn&apos;t, Geraldine. Now shush, I&apos;m going to ask her anyway.)
We must escape the Fort, then find a way off the island.
The world has a way of separating the chaff from the wheat. It can be painful, but it can&apos;t be avoided.

*The necromancer looks wistfully at one of the bodies.*
No! Of course not. But how can I leave them to suffer under the Void?
The Sourcerer Gawin has an escape plan - something involving a teleportation trick. He requires just one accomplice.
Greetin&apos;s, child. Frightful far from home, aren&apos;t ya? Visited your Ancient Empire meself, a lifetime ago. The Divine&apos;s light sure shines on your kind!
*Back away slowly, you&apos;ve had enough crazy for one day.*
Reaver&apos;s Axe
Saheila asked me to kill the Mother Tree and free the elves of her tyranny.
*Say that the path to the ship is clear - you cleared all obstacles, including a huge Voidwoken.*
*Tell him you suspect the jar has some value and you don&apos;t want to part with it.*
A pity my husband couldn&apos;t make it. He has his hands full, you see. Why, I barely ever see him myself!
Who are you to judge a soul? You who carries malice in her heart. You who useth your beauty to destroy. You who is wanton. Who are you to judge a soul?

Peacekeeper
Every day we learn more about the ills of the Deathfog that I carried for Lucian. I&lt;i&gt;... I... &lt;/i&gt;
*You float beyond darkness. There is only Void above and below.*
Adamas
I can bear anything for the sake of the realm. It was the most important lesson my father taught me. Be strong not because you &lt;i&gt;are;&lt;/i&gt; be strong because you &lt;i&gt;must,&lt;/i&gt; for them.
*Tell him he&apos;s insane and take your leave.*
Gave me an enchanted coat of arms, did the Source King. Made my word the law, did they. None could resist.
Remember, these are dangerous creatures but it is vital that you learn what they can teach you. Whatever the cost.
My guts were on fire this morning. I&apos;m dying. It must be the Deathfog - I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;sure &lt;/i&gt;of it.
In a Party
*Tell him you aren&apos;t interested.*
Colour me unimpressed, you ol&apos; brute. It&apos;s always the braggarts who cry the hardest when you stitch &apos;em up. Lucky for you, I think a good old-fashioned potion&apos;ll do you.
I would pray that the new Divine is just... but I don&apos;t pray anymore.

Give me a few minutes, and I&apos;ll get this lass splitting waves like it were her maiden voyage!

No, I don&apos;t expect you do. And I would not ask you to.

*Chuckles* You were always a funny one, Master Fane.

Francesca&apos;s a first-rate conjurer. You&apos;ll count yourself lucky to have her at your side.
*Take in the scenery around you. Ask her what comes next.*
This memorial should be torn down - those backstabbing curs don&apos;t deserve it.
