Getting out of here any way I damn can. Once I do, I know a place on the outside to head for.
Finally... it&apos;s almost over.
One designer - &lt;i&gt;Sanders&lt;/i&gt; - became a toy maker of all things.
*Emaciated of body and spirit, this Silent Monk stands straighter than the others, the remnants of military bearing clear in her posture.*
Outcast Hunter
A whole realm, within a single gem?
*She gives you a stern look... then widens it to take in your clothes, your gear, the experience implicit in your demeanour. Her hostility does not entirely diminish, but at least now she&apos;s &lt;i&gt;curious.*&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ve told you everything you need to... er, everything I know. What it is doesn&apos;t matter. What it does... well, if I am right, it will clean up quite an unholy mess. A mess we&apos;re both currently mired in.
Picture a maze filled with your greatest fears. Picture haunting that maze forever. That is but the first step into Horrorsleep.
The armour &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; alive - and I sense it wishes to be whole.
The Whites must have left &lt;i&gt;something &lt;/i&gt;of value behind!
Right, then. Good to know where we stand.
*Sneer at the Magister. He  doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;s in a position to kill anyone.*
Threadbare Gown
Hear that? Roost&apos;s camped out at the Sawmill.
Catrin Goebel
Salamander Form
Poisonball
You can&apos;t escape justice!
But I won&apos;t really change, not until I die and become something new. I&apos;m the Prime Scion. I... I cannot refuse.
There&apos;s something not right, and that&apos;s wrong! It&apos;s under the house thing here. And it&apos;s bad! I can smell it!
[SOLDIER] *Sniff the air. You feel... ready. Ready to lead the Order. Ready to march to victory.*
Dinner
Exter
My deepest apologies if I offended your sensibilities, madam.
*Say that surely the hunt for the tinkerer can be called off now - he harmed nobody.*
This bottle, containing a large-sized potion capable of granting telekinesis to its drinker, seems to jump within your hand.
Eternal Guardian
The key let us into the Fort. Freedom may lie beyond.
No need to play the innocent with me. Word has reached me, through a very &lt;i&gt;sour&lt;/i&gt; grapevine indeed, that you turned your back on your fellow passengers back on that ship. Left us to fend for ourselves...
*Tell him to cut to the chase. Who does he want dead?*
One can hardly get to the truth without one&apos;s tongue after all.
*Yes, you say with an eyebrow arched, but to whom will these bad things happen?*
Say, wait a sec! Lohse, z&apos;at you? You remember me, right? Laslor, from the Whistling Warriors! We opened up for you in Shoulder. Musta been... gods, &apos;round five years ago now!
Demonic Bargain
No... it ain&apos;t mine...
Flesh is weakness. I have no need of you.
I think I see you hurting someone. Please say it isn&apos;t you!
*Tears star her eyelashes and she begins to weep. She takes your hand.*
We learned that a group of dissident Magisters known as &apos;Seekers&apos; are helping Sourcerers escape. They might be able to help us.
Magisters
[1] increases all Fire damage you deal.
*So now that she&apos;s free, you can proceed? You want to move quickly.*
Metal Shield
*Ask how it&apos;s possible she is here, and unharmed!*
*The blow lands a little harder than you intended and he slumps. Without his struggling the armour slips free with ease.*
Three? Why should I grant you one?
Leather Armour
*Searing pain - a stone hits your shoulder. A sharp &lt;i&gt;crack &lt;/i&gt;- another glances off your skull. Your world turns red.*
*Tell it it will never understand people; you would never betray your companions.*
Come off it! Those fellas were mad as their master.
Oh, how sweet of you!
*The dwarf grins as he lifts a flap of cloth to reveal a string of grenades around his waist.*
Cannot be cast by Sourcerers&lt;br&gt;
Find the Thieves&apos; Guild.
Hallorn&apos;s Blade
*Say you are glad to see him freed from bondage.*
I could do that with one hand behind my spine. Now, shall we get on? There is rather a lot to see.
It spoke a name and spoke it true. Bad news, no doubt.
*The lizard spirit&apos;s face is still and his voice silent in spite of his torment. As his Source slithers into you, you are reminded again of the red beauty he stalked. &lt;i&gt;Sadha...*&lt;/i&gt;
Stew is people and people is stew.
Gods, it&apos;s Lady Haha &apos;ack again. Great. Just great.
*Demand to know where Dallis is.*
Once I was young. I danced on the ocean year upon year. As I aged, my timbers were replaced, one by one, over and over. I am old now but they are older.
Wouldn&apos;t try that if I were you.
Skills
Mordus... he feeds on my Source. Please. End this pain... grant me life...
Now, let&apos;s find out what makes this beauty tick...
R-r-r-row?
I guess I can remain silent. Just this once, of course. Now get out of here.
Pants of Magical Prowess
&lt;font color=&apos;#8e8178&apos;&gt;Right button - &lt;/font&gt;Attack Mode&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&apos;#8e8178&apos;&gt;Up button - &lt;/font&gt;Tactical View&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&apos;#8e8178&apos;&gt;Down button- &lt;/font&gt;Toggle Sneak
*She gives you an apologetic look, then turns away.*
*She darts her tongue out of her mouth like a snake.*
*Say you&apos;d like to know who&apos;s in charge around here.*
That shall not be an easy task. Confronting the Devourer could claim your life.
*Ask about the Doctor. Who is this person?*
Malady
He welcomes you with open arms. You shall walk with us in the new world. But you must do what the God King asks of you, when the time comes. Serve Him and He shall share the world with you.
That lever did something - I could feel it.
Murder Grog the troll.
*Admit that it&apos;s a pretty good plan. What was his role in it?*
The DoctorIsInDoctorIsInDoctorIsIn, he&apos;s in! He has the TrickstheGifts, the HealingWays theDealingWays the D-D-D-DARKways. Breathebreathebreathe... breathe... breathe... The DoctorIsInDoctorIsInDoctorIsIn!
Well, that just may interest our &lt;i&gt;current &lt;/i&gt;champion, Murga.
Almost there...
Indeed I am! We will follow your directions. You have my thanks, kinsman.
Listen carefully.
Bah, fine, I&apos;ll leave you to her pleasure.
Cursed Oil Infusion
If he survives this, he&apos;ll survive the Dunes. I won&apos;t have him sneaking back in the night to take another life. We search until we find him!
Male Human Skeleton
[SOLDIER] *Say it seemed like the most expedient way to end the discussion.*
*Of course you killed him! But ask why he needed you to get the merchant? Why not murder him with everyone else?*
People... &lt;i&gt;ask &lt;/i&gt;you to eat them?
If you polish it up a little, this platemail armour could double as a mirror.
as
Target a ground surface and conjure a totem of the corresponding element. Each turn, this totem will fire a projectile at enemies in sight.
Have at it.
*Tell him you&apos;re sorry, but he&apos;s a pain in the neck.*
You... you wouldn&apos;t. Ben-Mezd, intercede! No, &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;, there&apos;s no coming back from that!
It is immaculate - there is no trace of the filth that has infected this world.
Go on. I am here for you. &lt;i&gt;Give in to your hunger!&lt;/i&gt;
*Move along, just like Ralvo told you to.*
*His hand moves from his shovel to his sword. He wipes his forefinger along the blade, opening a bloody gash. He stares at the wound, then wipes the blood across his glistening forehead.*
*Shrug. All you can do is move on.*
Set Duration
*She glances at her body once more, a grim look on her face.*
Two-Handed Timber Axe
*Frown. That thing is her father?*
Oh, Lady Luck always came when I called. For thirty years we roamed Rivellon together; she was my faithful mistress - from card game, to wager, to grift. She was the life of me... yet she wants no dead man.
A dwarf out of her kingdom, yes, like a fish out of water, dangling helplessly from a hook.
Let me tell you a story &apos;bout Justinia. I think we were, say, age ten at the time. My pop was off who-knows-where, spreadin&apos; his seed in that oh-so-charmin&apos; manner of his. So let&apos;s just say the court had its hands full.
Mana: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
I&apos;ll regret this, I know I will. Alright, I&apos;ll stand aside.
*The patient cat finally pounces. You strike, precisely; exactly. Your needle pierces his neck: spears his vocal cords, filling his throat with blood.*
*Tell Gareth you do not have a Purging Wand, but he should continue to the rally point regardless.*
I have my orders - the prisoner stays where she is, and you can move along.
*The skeleton groans and looks back to his book, frantically flipping from page to page.*
Saheila says we are free of the ancestor trees. She says there shall be a new Mother, but it shall not be Saheila. I pray the Mother is as strong and kind as the beautiful Saheila.
Do you think that makes you &lt;i&gt;special&lt;/i&gt;? I was the first to hear the melody of the dragon&apos;s bones! Before the Empress, before they were armour.
Protective Armour
Elemental Havoc (Air)
*The spirit has served her purpose. Take her Source.*
[BARBARIAN] *Grunt in approval. You can&apos;t let anyone talk to you like that.*
Do just that, might I. Or I might take you as a slave to serve my supper..
*No! Explain that you don&apos;t need to fight - you can work together. You can try to find others!*
(Does he have the ingredients? I bet he doesn&apos;t even have the ingredients!)
*Recall the idyllic days before she became queen. What is this... grotesquerie she&apos;s become?*
Grounded
Follow Yarrow to her father Migo.
*Tell her yes - you met her people and promised to return her to them.*
*Ask about the wedding.*
Please... help... me...
The Eternal Gardens, the Floating City, the King&apos;s hunting grounds, abounding with all manner of creature...
*Avert your eyes and consume his Source. This sinner&apos;s feelings do not concern you.*
*Give him an apologetic smile and shake your head. Tell him he and his friends shall be the ones to die.*
Mind Control Device
*Turn away.*
He is a god for the godless. A beacon for those who have no place in this world. He seeks to cast down the world of the Seven, and build a new world, with the Sworn at his side.
&apos;Ey! It&apos;s Fran! That&apos;s mine, ya hear?
Peep...? Peep...
*Place the artefact in your pack.*
You want the food for yourself, don&apos;tcha?! I should never have said anything. I&apos;m going to protect my food. &lt;i&gt;Stay away from it, you!&lt;/i&gt;
The worn but neatly-folded parchment smells faintly of kerosene and medical salve.
*You feel Amadia lurch forward in fury, straining against your will. Release it, let it speak.*
*The trickster-formerly-known-as-Callo stands in Baran Levere&apos;s robes, twirling his fake moustache with what can only be described as supreme panache.*
*The rat&apos;s eyes widen.*
He is not of this world. In flesh, he cut away my tongue. In spirit, he... he will do much worse. I know it!
*Demand she return your gold. Now.*
*The dog is blinded by its muzzle, but turns its face toward you, waiting for your answer.*
Advice? Hm. Hold onto yourself, my friend. The fort is full of decent folks turned savage by confinement. Do not let it happen to you.
*He eyes you shrewdly, then sniffs with judgement.*
So you are...
An explosive filled with nails that do [1] and may inflict bleeding to everyone in a [2] radius. Creates a small fire surface with a [3] radius.
An ancient jar containing the ghastly shade of a soul.
*...a you of great military bearing, born to serve and born to fight. But then the Sallow Man&apos;s grin becomes a snarl, and his outreached hand grasps at you, grabs hold of a part of you, and &lt;i&gt;pulls...*&lt;/i&gt;
[1] improves your aptitude at picking locks.
Unfortunately for both of us, no.
So still here. Like the air itself&apos;s been petrified.
