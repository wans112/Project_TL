A spike broken from the corpse of a Voidwoken
I can hardly be expected to feel pity for another creature&apos;s incompetence.
Sparking and fizzing with barely-restrained energy, this spear sings its own name as it flies: Ednet Voor, the Bane-shooter.
*He presses a forefinger against his chin and hums.*
Maybe Lucian as well... Perhaps even a god deserves a second chance. Even if he is a god without powers.
*Note that Sarias&apos;s ritual is done. At least he has found rest.*
Oh... this can&apos;t be good. Arx isn&apos;t worth all this headache; unleash the Deathfog!&lt;br&gt;
*She takes your hand.*
Yellow Button
*Stow the lamp in your backpack. Weird treasure is still treasure.*
She was troubled only by the silence of her goddess.
Why, the stories are legendary, my good man. As you must have known of me from lupine tales, so do I know of you. Any Lone Wolf would recognise the Silver Claw on sight. To meet you is a &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; honour.
I... need to tell you something.
I think you&apos;ve made yourself clear enough already.
What is it now...?
*Give her the bad news: one of her owls is dead.*
[LIZARD] *Ask about his travels. Has he ever travelled through the Ancient Empire?*
We tricked our way past the Path of Blood and journeyed on.
I should hope so. Trapped me, did he, yes. But &lt;i&gt;now &lt;/i&gt;he rots in a mouldering casket while Sech Zapor will reclaim every jot of what he&apos;s lost.
Search for your stolen stuff.
*Reach out and shake her hand.*
Damage is based on your current Magic Armour.
*Tell him to get on with it. He might be immortal, but you can feel your life passing you by.*
*Nod and tell her you grieve for those you have lost.*
Good as any motivator, if a rather dry one.
Strong is bark; weak is flesh. Even this dying heart will shred you!&lt;br&gt;
*Take pause. Imagine all the death and decay she&apos;s been party to as a result of her choice.*
So? Did he help you with the *ahem* matter at hand?
*You feel the collar slowly twist on your neck. After some time, with a creak of tortured metal, it snaps and falls broken from your neck.*
We have ventured on from Reaper&apos;s Coast, without investigating this matter any further.
Mystical Giant Rock Rune
*Offer to help Gareth find the weapon he needs.*
*The cook slides a wooden spoon into a simmering pot of broth. She lifts out a goat skull, hooked though the eye socket.*
No more disappearances... I have nothing more to say to the likes of you. Go!
*Reach out to touch her.*
[SEBILLE] *Keep your distance and tell her that just a moment ago, she looked like she was fully possessed.*
Well - that&apos;s that sorted. Time to move on. Though I&apos;m quite sure Lohse would appreciate making her own decision, next time.
Skeletons - Tough
*Ask what he means by &apos;cavies&apos;.*
But what about... what about the other grownups? Can&apos;t they come too?
That you&apos;re a... how did Malady put it again? A &lt;i&gt;Godwoken &lt;/i&gt;- yes, that&apos;s it. Quite remarkable, if it&apos;s true.
Orifice manipulator - activated!
Flesh Sacrifice
Sadha the Red Princess
Lagan left his over-demanding wife and began a relationship with a local bard.
*The younger of the two glances at the other. His face goes white.*
*You tear at the fabric of her very existence - and she resists in the only way she can; with a barrage of memories - the love of her mother, the pride of her father, the pain of her first broken heart. But this makes her weaker...*
*Tell her the world is going to hell anyway, she should have fun while she still can.*
No-one ever does. But so far no-one has found the ruthlessness their gods demand. Me, I serve Tir-Cendelius. I am at your service. How may I help you?
The House of Shadows hunts the Red Prince, but he does not know why. Another dreamer may help, out in the Hollow Marshes.
I intercepted some Magister communications from there a while ago. Seems like their Voidwoken problems have decreased lately... but they&apos;re not quite sure why.
*The hooded man exudes an aura of restrained menace. As he raises his head, the hood falls back, revealing the gleaming bone visage of an undead. He grins in seeming recognition.*
*And how very wonderful that feels.*
Character Creation
Woof!
*Shake your head. Nothing&apos;s changed since last you spoke.*
*Demand that he yield. The quest for a Divine supersedes his juvenile need for revenge.*
*Squeak!* I used to have a sister named Chlo. But Chlo tried to sneak out the back do&apos; and now Chlo is no mo.
Causes Rot infection unless handler is skilled in Tenebrium use.
*Shake your head.*
*Tell her no: it&apos;s actually why you invited her to join you.*
Only the best for the Red Prince, surely you must realise that by now!
The invasive earth tongue mushroom migrated from the isolated peaks of Yuthul Gor and has been slowly crowding out the native mushroom species. However, this badly translated recipe explains how to squeeze it into a potion bottle, insisting this nuisance some redeeming qualities.
[IFAN] *Tell her it was nothing.*
*Arrf! Bark!*
Ancient... yet more advanced than any architecture of today.
[SCHOLAR] *Say &apos;nothing&apos;.*
*Tell him you could have mercy, if he teaches you to channel more Source.*
I, the Prime Scion, am my Master&apos;s ultimate assassin - the killer of Scions. Now, the Master&apos;s scar song has failed. Now he will die.
The Quorum. It was here that they made history. In this very room, in fact.
Death will become a thing of the past...
*Pandun. He knew your name, gurgled it through blood. You killed him because the Master forced you to.*
Taunt the enemies around you. Provoke and tease them so that they want to attack you.
You are cautious. An admirable quality. I, too, have... &lt;i&gt;difficulty&lt;/i&gt; with trust.
*Pretend not to know who he is, and bow as if towards nobility.*
I hope you won&apos;t be a stranger, my dear... I do like to keep in touch with my acquaintances.
*Before he pulls away, he squeezes tighter, lifting you from the ground so you feel weightless.*
*Tell her that none of this would have been possible without her.*
A letter from a mysterious correspondent known only as &apos;I&apos;. It mentions a wine named after a pig. Weird.
The Seven Lords, beneath the King in authority, but far above me. I brought them my research - I showed them everything.
Wisely done.
*Ask what he means. What&apos;s &apos;Anathema&apos;?*
A word of advice to the badly armed: Tie your knife (or shiv if that&apos;s all you have) to a stick or a branch. Now you&apos;ve got a sword. Of sorts.
Braccus must have failed - had he not, the world as you know it would be gone. What I learned of could still be out there. I will not speak of it. I won&apos;t risk having another Braccus discovering it.
*Stare at him in shock and ask what the hell he thinks he&apos;s doing.*
You! You found him! Excellent, now stand aside.
Figurehead
Practice Sword
I&apos;ll comb this place plank by plank. I&apos;ll find him!
Ah. Well, then. &apos;Make a scene&apos;, it is.
How can such power be left lying in some dusty jug?
You&apos;ve returned. You tire of my ditty, do you?
*She blows you a kiss. A shiver runs through your bones, and you turn away.*
Potion of Allure
Blaithin&apos;s Key
The less you know, the better. Trust me. Stop Mordus, and I&apos;ll take care of the rest.
*She who&apos;s been in your dreams since the sunburst that was your own dawn.*
*Ask him why he sought Divinity, if Lucian is alive to be saved.*
Magister Training Spear
Iron Leg Armour
Honestly, Quercus. Some creatures have no sense of perspective.
Wood Chopper
*You&apos;re ready to enter the dream.*
&lt;i&gt;You are Duna&apos;s flesh. Why do you call to me before your time has come?&lt;/i&gt;
And don&apos;t you expect that to change, neither. You helped me out, but I don&apos;t owe you nothin. Elf.
*ALARM! ALARM! INTRUDER!*
Sebille. Your actions cause great pain to the Mother. You cause great pain to all elves when you run from duty.  You cause great pain to yourself.
*Ask about these so-called dead people.*
And so you judge me without even knowing who you are.
*Tell him true: Magisters attacked the Wavedancer. Saving his crew meant invoking Source.*
I know little. But you have proven yourself a knowing traveller. I will answer what I can.
Well, not for Alexandar, it didn&apos;t. The other three rebuffed his demand!
*Taryan weeps for Raedalus, her lost love.*
[IFAN] *Refuse. You walk your own path now, gods be damned.*
Pigsbane
First Aid Skillbook
But let&apos;s not forget to find Zaleskar. I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; so eager to meet the man.
I gave up my Divinity. I used the Source of the world to seal the Veil and banish the Void. Will peace reign with Rivellon shorn forever of Source? Time, as always, will tell.
*Laugh, hard. She could tell that just from smelling you?*
*Kemm rolls his eyes and groans.*
Magisters, and Paladins too. It was a hell of a fight. Dozens dead. And in the end, well... no-one wanted to kill a sweet little boy. So they put a collar on me instead.
Look away from the past and into the future, Fane. You&apos;ve made reparations. Now, you must begin anew.
*He raises a hand in salute and... disappears.*
You run along now, darlin&apos;. You shouldn&apos;t spend what little time you&apos;ve got left here listenin&apos; to an old bleedin&apos; heart moan.
*Take your leave.*
Confront Justinia.
*Swear in frustration.*
Bock, bock, bock.
*The arm convulses as it hits the ground. The energy empowering it is fading away.*
The Hammer&apos;s Fury
My dear, I&apos;m so &lt;i&gt;sorry&lt;/i&gt; if I offended. I should be more tactful.
*Ask who he&apos;s here to kill.*
Magister Julian
Fluorescent Explosion
*Snap that the island is overrun with Black Ring! What are they doing here?*
*Ask why the White Magisters held him captive here.*
Twenty-two centuries, only to find death after all... All kings must die. All crowns, eventually, are hollow.
*Sebille is her own calm self again. Her eyes trace a bird of prey, black against blue in the sky.*
Character is bound with Source chains. Character cannot move, yet is invulnerable because it is Soul Shackled.
Where...? But... but where are you going?
Only the elven Godwoken who did not ascend could save them now.
I killed the Shadow Prince of the House of Shadows.
*The spirit stares at you. His visage of spectral bone exudes contempt.*
Hold in hand
*Look around. There&apos;s no-one else here. How did he die?*
You speak the spell with brash ferocity, like I knew you would, my wolf.
She&apos;s my fwend. She was one of the magistas once! She was vewy high up. She used to look for god people &apos;an help them.
You&apos;re very kind. How about another one? Penny for a dead dog?
Source weapons are being smuggled from Driftwood in shipments of Void-tainted fish.
I&apos;m sorry, darling. It&apos;s a set-up. You paid for a trip to paradise, now you&apos;re paying for the return journey.
Robbed!
*Remain sceptical. Dragons becoming lizards? Say that&apos;s an implausible tale at best.*
(He won&apos;t help us, look at him, can barely help himself.) Yes sir, please help us.
Listener Priest
From [1]: [2][3]% (offhand weapon)
Since it is &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a fine day, I can let you pass at a discount if you entertain me with tales of valiant Voidwoken battle. Otherwise? Full price! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
*Say no protection is worth the price of freedom.*
How very unfortunate for you, and how very boring for me.
*Say you&apos;re not interested in blood sport.*
*Tell him that Grog asked you to get rid of the competition...*
