Poor, mewling child. You know nothing of the wheels that turn around you. But they shall spin no more - my lord wishes you dead, and it brings me joy to grant that wish.
What can I say? I&apos;m a prince with a prince&apos;s appetites.
Really? Phew! This is... this is amazing news. But what of the queen? What&apos;s been going on? Is she safe?
*Ask him why he was looking for that flower.*
I&apos;m glad you understand. Together, we&apos;ll escape this place and triumph over the Magisters yet.
Very well, sir.

All of us. All lizards are descendants of dragons.
Karon&apos;s unleashed. The Mistake - repeated! You must contain him. Return him. &lt;i&gt;Destroy him. &lt;/i&gt;
*The ground under your feet trembles, as if an enormous creature just landed beside you.*
*Offer him a drink.*
The Voidwoken are coming, scale-shedder. And it&apos;s only the Divine Order that can protect us.
Now that we meet again, Red Prince, I wonder if you&apos;d be so kind as to assist me with yet another little matter...

[FANE] *Tell him your name is Fane.*
Kemm has an appraiser visiting. I&apos;m trying to meet her.
Please... I must insist you keep out of my kitchens; it&apos;s not safe for you to wander about like this...
*Tell Ros you will do whatever it takes to talk some sense into Justinia - and end her plans.*

This can&apos;t be serious, Alexandar! Come!

*Lohse reaches toward the demon.*
I just wish they hadn&apos;t been necessary...
Add consumables
Cut
Blood... and it won&apos;t be long before he&apos;ll have it, with all his thugs lurking about... They&apos;d stick me in my sleep if they knew.
Where&apos;d you get it? There can&apos;t be many curios like that in the world.
*The statue responds to you. You feel it reach out to you. &lt;i&gt;Into &lt;/i&gt;you...*
Come. We have a clear view from here.
*Tell him you&apos;re listening.*
*The creature begged for release. But - can it be trusted?*
A strategist. Perhaps in need of some practice, but a strategist all the same.
[OUTLAW] *Tell him you&apos;d have your hands in someone else&apos;s purse.*
I&apos;ll go outside, but I won&apos;t go unarmed. And I&apos;ll take &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;weapon too, if it&apos;s available. What do you say, can I count on your help?
He&apos;ll be so glad to have his puppy back, even if she&apos;ll have lost some of her lustre...
HAIL, MAKER, FULL OF GRACE.
I&apos;ve never seen her react like that to anyone but Gareth. You&apos;re a miracle worker, and no mistake!
No, a more direct approach was required.
*Reach your hand out to touch the shrine.*
Miaow. Miaow-miaow. Miaow-miaow-miaow-miaow-miaow-miaow. Miaow.
More dwarves? Now I&apos;m getting annoyed.
*This the moment. Strike. &lt;i&gt;Now!*&lt;/i&gt;
Paladin Lora Charlet
Is m-my Daddy alright? Why won&apos;t he s-say anything?
You have come. My chosen. It is not too late. Not yet. But almost!
*Remind him that he&apos;s speaking of the new Divine - perhaps he ought to afford them some more respect.*
You just made the wrong move. There&apos;s a place for thieves like you: a prison cell.

Outta my way, two-legs! It&apos;s mating season, I&apos;ve got places to be!

I want to make sure you understand... well, the risks.
It matters not! All that matters is that you give it to me.
*You&apos;ve got all you need. Consume his Source.*
Amadouvier is particularly tough piece of fungus, highly sought-after by potion brewers. If you can manage to harvest it, the resulting concoction will grant the drinker skin as thick as amadouvier itself. Temporarily, of course.

What an abomination...
It&apos;s for the best, after all.
Spirit of Lyn Pryce
Mihaly is fading. Is the way clear? Can we escape?
Squeeeeee!
*After a few moments of agony, you&apos;re left with nothing but darkness and Rhalic&apos;s echoing laughter.*
Far from pointless, my girl. Trust an old woman, would you?
Please. I&apos;m not a dilettante.
I... I think I know that voice.
*Insist he stop second-guessing himself. You&apos;ve got to stay focused.*
Spare the indignation and hand it over. *Ahem* Now.

You&apos;re still here. Try not to be.
*Look at him in shock. You&apos;re not going to kill him!*

Let the feasting begin!
*Tell him you&apos;re prepared to fight for what you believe to be right.*
*A grim look floods the spirit&apos;s face.*
We cannot push valuable allies away out of fear.
[LOHSE] *Say alright. Yes. But, you tell the rat, you&apos;re not crazy.*
That woman. What&apos;s she done?
But we have his name. There may be something we can do to hinder him before you even meet. I&apos;ll do some investigating while you&apos;re busy hunting Dallis. My suspicions are right? We may still stand a chance.
*He lays the sword against the wall.*
*...Zanisima the Scientist.*
I&apos;ve seen what Deathfog can do. There&apos;s few who deserve an end like that. But there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a few.
In Fort Joy, you&apos;re about to fall further than you thought possible. And I&apos;ll be listening for the splat.
*Shake your head. You didn&apos;t meet anyone named Gareth.*
Now I&apos;m even more annoyed than I was before. You&apos;re under arrest, thief.
My, my, Beast! How you positively brim with Source. No wonder, after all the adventures you have had; all the things you&apos;ve had to do...

You pay for taking me as a fool. thief!
Bless a surface
*He sidles blindly beside the cart, groping his way toward you.*
It&apos;s too bad I&apos;m not in the mood for storytime. I think I like the story where you die for your crimes a lot more...
*His eyelids rise and he glares at the ceiling.*
What&apos;s that...? It sounds like there&apos;s a battle unfolding nearby...
*The idea doesn&apos;t take - his indoctrination is still too strong. His anger at the Sourceress for what she did will never fade.*
I am. Under. Attack.
I see you. We are in ritual for a fallen brother. You may talk to Tovah. Do not break ritual.
Judge him with a forgiving heart. Fate has been unkind to him.
Hnr?
*The spirit&apos;s head twists around, eyes snapping open and focusing on you for the first time.*
I find them. Hope they can restore the Ancestor Trees lost in the war.
Play-time&apos;s over. Bugger off.
I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; I don&apos;t know. But if I&apos;m correct, and her heart has been darkened by the Ring, you may be able to find her through their scrying magic.
I-... I do not know.
Well, that was certainly a &lt;i&gt;messy &lt;/i&gt;display of dominance.
*Ask about the rebellion. What happened?*
Hope you&apos;re treating the pointy lock un-doer as though it were your very own!
She&apos;s gonna let it loose. The Deathfog. In Arx... she&apos;ll do it. Run. Run away. Away from Arx.
Yes, ma&apos;am.
*Ask about Braccus&apos; secrets. What can he tell you?*
A deal&apos;s a deal. Let&apos;s get this over with.
Gratiana
The powers of all divinity must unite, and they must unite in you: the paragon of lizards. Our kind must rule this world and none other. None of the primordial slime that made it onto two legs by nature&apos;s oversight.
Elemental Tortoise
*The Sallow Man, without speaking, tells you Alexandar is in hiding. The temple of the elves has yet to fall - this seems a likely place to look. You&apos;ll bring his head to Sallow&apos;s cave.*
Something isn&apos;t right here. It could be an ambush...
*The spirit whips his head towards the caged boy. His eyes narrow, even as the child&apos;s widen in apparent terror.*

The villain&apos;s dead. He is gone along with his name. All gone... All gone...
The Hall of Echoes seems... different. Something has changed, and not for the better.
[OUTLAW] *Remark in admiration that these Gheists are equipped with interesting contraptions. You&apos;d love a set of those claws for yourself.*
Wildfire sparks from this hardy wand; if you&apos;re very quiet, you can hear its inner embers crackle.
You won&apos;t regret keepin&apos; those friends of yours at your right hand. Trust me.
Don&apos;t feel too bad. Fella had no decency. If you don&apos;t have that, you don&apos;t have anything to live for.
