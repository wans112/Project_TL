What I wouldn&apos;t give for a taste o&apos; fresh grass...
&lt;i&gt;&apos;...sorrow. Our joy shall be the Godwoken&apos;s sorrow. Our joy sh-sh-sh... sorrow...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
I am Baran Levere...
You&apos;re really nice. I like you. You can have this. I found it outside but I can&apos;t read it yet. That&apos;s next year, and then I&apos;ll learn it.
*He screams and thrashes in your grip, then feverishly speaks.*
Ugh. Where is that foul odour coming from?
To be better I must butcher. All new beginnings require sacrifice.
But &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; not, are you? You&apos;re not a meek little lamb at all...
You are trying to get into even more trouble, I see. You are under arrest!
*Say you&apos;ve managed to maintain your integrity, despite the many temptations you&apos;ve faced.*
X
We should keep our eyes on the prize: divinity...
*He closes his eyes, refusing to further acknowledge your presence.*
It is time for vengeance. You &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; cut off its breath, then bring me its heart!
...but perhaps I can. Care to take a peek?
Incandescent Marksman
I am come for you, Silver Claw... come to rip your fur from your wretched bones... come to taste your pain... COME TO MAKE YOU PAY...
*Tell her you won&apos;t give up on her until there&apos;s no breath left in either of your bodies.*
*Wonder what she&apos;ll do next.*
Lay low? My eye! I&apos;ve got enough firepower to toast &apos;em all to ash.
Giant Dune Beetle
No... that cannot be true... it &lt;i&gt;cannot! &lt;/i&gt;Pray at the altars and seek the path into the Council. The Gods will not fail us - you&apos;ll see.

Gods, make it STOP!
A word of advice to the unarmed: Find a sharp piece of metal. Wrap one end in cloth. Now you have a shiv. You&apos;re no longer unarmed.
I don&apos;t know anything about the sewers, and I don&apos;t think you do, either.
This dwarf speaks truth. Boy, I&apos;ll let the rest of you live. But you&apos;re gonna do me a favour. You&apos;re going to tell your friends, and your neighbours, and every stranger you meet about this day.
You there! Sorry to intrude, but I must look through your bags. Someone makes off with my personal belongings!
Undeployed Poison Gas Trap
*The Paladin looks up from her wound to give you a look of disdain.*
The Second Passion of Lucian
*Ask the child what she knows about the crates stacked outside her hideout.*
The Houses disbanded and the Empire adopted a pluralist quasi-democracy -
You&apos;ll do what you have to do, right? If I fail... if this thing takes control... you&apos;ll protect yourself and everyone else against it.
Loud! Fire and steel! Crash bash boom splat! It was warm, then it was cold. No-one left. Just salamanders. They like the meat.
[NOBLE] *Demand that he tell you whatever it is that he&apos;s keeping back.*
*Tilt your head. He seems in an awfully good mood.*
You beat Murga?
Karon met us in Lucian&apos;s crypt. He was out of his mind.
We should bless the cursed lever, or we&apos;ll end up like the dead Magisters.
*Intervene. He should leave her alone!*
They want their roots to conquer every last inch of Rivellon. World domination; the prevalence of one race over all others, that is what they desire. That is what I counteract.
There are enough dwarves scurrying around Driftwood, but Reimond must hear your words. You may pass. But tell me: did you see signs of battle? Of our Magister brothers and sisters?
He was. And trust me, the Divine Order of today has nothing to do with Lucian&apos;s. Everything, &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; started to go downhill during the war, after my last mission.
This traitor is sentenced to die. Your words cannot change that.
*Shout at him to wake up.*
*Wordlessly he breathes; a torrent of anger and rage... but &lt;i&gt;changed.&lt;/i&gt; This new anger is more confident and sure... and &lt;i&gt;more powerful. &lt;/i&gt;And in the rage are snatches of memory - of Sallow, dying in the fog.&lt;i&gt;*&lt;/i&gt;
Next time you want to use Sourcery around here you might want to think twice. Bad things tend to happen...
I... I... Who would know? Who would know? Must be... Griff! Yes, Griff knows! I assure you!
Ain&apos;t like me to side with someone called a &apos;king&apos;, but he sounds a might finer than the Seven, from what I can tell.
... So your intent was honourable, even though your actions spoke against Duna.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the Ancestor Tree on Bloodmoon Island behind.
Void-touched Beetle
Air Ward
*He glances up. Recognises you.*
*Her features darken; a sudden storm.*
Door Close
*Reach for the sword.*
*Take the brown fish.*
*She loses herself in a fit of giggles.*
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;SILVER KISS&lt;/b&gt;.*
[Translate68_273bc662-ba8e-4cfc-94a8-fc2b97086d3d]

[VILLAIN] *Encourage him to explore this rage. You will clear a path; he will have his revenge.*
Air resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
I&apos;m c-cold. I wanna go home...
The academy! I did my research here...
Battered Key
Ain&apos;t no rest for any dwarf in Driftwood. Not even me.
*Whispers* I&apos;ll be quiet as a mouse, you bet. Squeak squeak squeak. Hehe. Now go on down. Effie&apos;s Emporium is your bag, for sure.
*Explain that you&apos;ve found a Purging Wand like that, but it&apos;s inert.*
[BEAST] *Smile. Tell him that, truth be told, you live for a little drama now and again.*
The Savage
Hallucinogenic Smoke Cloud
Military Essays I: What makes an expert Swordsman?&lt;br&gt;There are three types of swordsmen: the beginners, the bravados and the masters. If you have already learned the basic techniques you can easily distinguish the beginners from the experts. A beginner does not know how to hold a sword properly and his fighting stance is completely unbalanced. The bravados are versed in the arts of sword fighting but they reveal their knowledge merely through exhibition. You can find many bravados at fairs where they demonstrate their skills in front of the excited masses. A real sword master is a mentor who travels from town to town to teach his skills but he will always hide his best tricks. A true sword master will teach you everything you know... not everything he knows.
Damned spore is bloody gone! I can&apos;t take this.
*Bloody bubbles froth from her mouth. She&apos;s not long for this world.*
Crafting Bible, Part XIV
Turn Into a Dwarf
*The cat sighs dejectedly, and looks away.*
*Giggle* My home is far. Your language gives me some trouble. We elves... &apos;time&apos; for us is &apos;now&apos;. There is not &apos;then&apos; and &apos;when&apos;.
*Offer him a double handful of coins to change his mind.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82])
Ha! I&apos;ll do ya one better!
Playing Dead
I am more than aware of your service, but do not mistake favour for an obligation.
ROLL THE DICE
But enough talk. I need more. I need your Source. I need your life&apos;s blood.
*Acting funny? Ask what she means.*
A Mystery Resolved
Damn right. Lucian spoke of creatures like this &apos;Windego&apos;. They spread their black magic to our children with songs and stories. Makes me sick. Our little ones... tools of demons!
*Ask permission.*
*Give him the sword.*
If you can see me now, boss, I hope you understand.
*You recognise the approaching child. He is hardly a picture of innocence. His cheeks aren&apos;t rosy, but sallow. His smile isn&apos;t curious, but crooked.*
Waters is investigating. She&apos;ll figure out who did it. Always does.
Well. I don&apos;t think this is it for me. I&apos;m in my prime. Good fighting condition. Never better. And the &apos;ol&apos; son-of-a&apos;, has been quiet as hell lately. Have you noticed?
&lt;i&gt;*His&lt;/i&gt; bridge? Say that you&apos;re pretty sure taxpayer coin constructed this bridge.*
*Cough.* *COUGH.* *ARGH!* This is no healing potion!
*Ryker&apos;s mouth widens into a tight smile.*
That&apos;s right, Godwoken. Another Seeker is dead, so you might live long enough to face your destiny. I hope Malady is right about you...
*Ask if there&apos;s anything you need to know about this Griff character.*
[FANE] *Had you a stomach, it would have dropped at those words. They were punished for disobeying their king?*
Far from a scientific treatise, the book Ryker was reading is a work of memoir by a high-ranking Paladin whose experiences during the Great War left him utterly without faith in the Divine Order.
Help me!
Let me have a look. It&apos;ll just take a moment.
Wolves in sheep&apos;s clothing, that is all these Magisters are. We&apos;ve seen it proven time and again.
Does our word mean nothing? Destroy the jar!
Confidant of the Divine himself, Arhu is a cunning wizard, adept at changing his form and summoning aid to his side.
Scrub all you like, the Source hounds can still catch the scent of Source.
*Ask if the bodies were all silent monks.*
Sacrificial Chest
The Order. My comrades... I don&apos;t regret leaving with Almira, but I did swear an oath. I hear Bishop Alexandar made it to the island with some followers - what came of him?
Just when I think the mists might cloud my heart again, you&apos;re there to dispel them. You&apos;re right - let&apos;s just get on with it.
&lt;i&gt;Dallis told me about you. You must be as hard as diamonds and twice as bright, to have come so far.&lt;/i&gt;
*She shakes her head in return.*
Julian? JULIAN? Where the devil has that snot nose gone?
*Jahan? Say you stepped in from the shadows for him before.*
No. Braccus is the one with the ring. You are not he.
You can&apos;t stand in the way of art, my friend.
Encumbered
The distinctive patterning on this axe marks it out as an artefact of the Ancient Empire.
*Once, this was a tavern. Or a hotel. Or a brothel.*
Still, you look like you have something to hide.
A box with some supplies, just the kind you&apos;d take on a journey yourself.
Petrified Marauder
*A smirk curls across her face.*
Dune Spider
You... you healed me? How did you... never mind. I don&apos;t care how. I only care that today won&apos;t be my last.
Yes. It&apos;s been a &lt;i&gt;horrendous &lt;/i&gt;day. Still, it&apos;s a fine match. With her assets and my name, I - that is to say, &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;will be a force to be reckoned with.
*Your accusation provokes nothing more than a raised eyebrow from the cook.*
*Ask her to go on - for what were you chosen?*
Eternal Turret
Arrow Poison
*Sigh* But Mother, I&apos;m sleeping!
Nothing unusual in here.
School o&apos; Hard Knocks. University o&apos; Life. Academy o&apos; This&apos;n&apos;that. I have the talent for it, and whenever I found someone with skill I asked them to teach me.
I&apos;m no warrior. My... my mission has only ever been to watch and share what I see. I give information to Alexandar. He doesn&apos;t give information to me.
I act on my own will. The Order comes for the Kingdom, and so it must be silenced. We soon release Deathfog... into all of Arx.
Our deference and respect earned the elves&apos; approval.
Whatever your purpose in Arx, you may be disappointed.
*And now? Ask what he&apos;s going to do next.*
There&apos;s weapons - ancient devices that can counter those things. Our leader, Sir Gareth, set out to find them, so we could break the Magister blockade and escape this island.
*Noticing that he is not haunted by a ghost, warn him that killing may not be as much fun as he thinks it&apos;ll be.*
Well, &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;use it to keep the milk and cheese cold.
You returned to the world as a Godwoken who failed to become Divine. Did you accept your failure with dignity or did it destroy you?
*The dagger presses harder in reply, and you&apos;ve no other option but to recoil a few paces.*
*Say you&apos;ll take care of it right away.*
Forest Green
Had he succeeded, perhaps I would have been able to help, but now...
My friend! It&apos;s so good to see you!
*Scan the lines of his face. Something about him seems... familiar.*
