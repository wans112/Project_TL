I&apos;m a lover, not a fighter.
*Ask how she knew you were undead.*
I&apos;d give anything to be like you. I think this is the whole reason I&apos;m a host. I just take everything in. Everything, all the time. It&apos;s just too much.
*You shake it off. It won&apos;t come off.*
*Scoff and say now is not the time to lose heart!*
Ya gotta bring yer friends here first, ya buffoon. Come back when yer ready to go.
There&apos;s no-one left alive in there to save.
*The dwarf looks you up and down with a most dubious look in his eye. Clearly finding you lacking in some way, he snorts and turns back to Ifan.*
I know my brother walks the Halls now, but I miss him dearly. For me, part of living is honouring those who went before. And I feel closest to him here in Arx, near where he died on the Path of Blood.
Lord Arhu has perished. We... we failed him.
Spirit of Brother Morgan

You&apos;re very generous; thank you.
*Change your mind.*
*Ricks looks to his companion, who then looks to you. They drop their hands to their sides.*
So you understand: I must know all there is to know about my chosen. You must tell me &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask her what&apos;s in this secret stash.*
*She turns to look at you at last.*
Be not frightened by my splendAWKAWKAWor.

Toy Chair
I have *snort* nothing to say to you!
Day 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extreme precautions must to be taken to ensure the security of the vaults. The demons seem, at times, on the verge of breaking through their chains. Should such an eventuality take place, we must prevent them from escaping. The levers that could open the doors must be broken.
Hah! Collared like a dog! A very pink, very long dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
Here, Godtaint. Spend it wisely.
Incarnate Ranged Attack
Are you afraid of seeming boastful, Godwoken? Come now - show me what you know.
Bellwether! I need those reports, dammit!
This place... there is great power in the air.
*Leave him to his troubles.*
*Point out that if Alexandar can come back from the dead, a Sourcerer can learn how to break a Source collar.*
A word of warning to you, Miss Kaleran, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait.&lt;/i&gt;
Promise?
I&apos;ve seen the etchings myself, mate! It&apos;s gone!
[IFAN] *Say that what you remember is how much you like silence.*
Ridiculous! There&apos;s no such thing as &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; dominating.
Odd.
Lohar! He&apos;s been involved from the start! And Justinia! That... That... Oh, but I won&apos;t say the word! I&apos;ve had enough of words! We need action!
You can&apos;t go in there, missus. The Meistr isn&apos;t home an&apos; the Magisters locked her house up for her.
It&apos;s Magisters you want, is it? Plenty of those at Fort Joy, Sourcerer. Why don&apos;t you -
*Call for the bartender and ask her to explain this device to you.*
&apos;f &apos;e thinks &apos;e owns me &apos;e&apos;s got another think coming! I own &apos;im! An&apos; I&apos;ll own you too; I know you think I&apos;m beautiful. You do, don&apos;t ya? *Purrrrrrrrrrrrr.*
*The spirit remains on the ground, his axe still tightly grasped in his fist.*
*She looks you over once again. The judgemental arch of her eyebrow suggests you&apos;re less than she had hoped for.*
Capital!
This one might be fixable.
Strange. I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before...
Argh! Fire! It &apos;urns!
Step aside, stranger.
Hideout
Spirit of an Impure Pilgrim
You can do better than that, can&apos;t you?
Voidwoken, shriekers, and now these...things.

*Shake your head. The groom also wants a copy of the merchant&apos;s will.*
Lucian spoke of absolution for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;. I... I must...
Totems of the Necromancer
...we&apos;ve taken care of thousands.
Thank you. Simply that. &lt;i&gt;Thank you&lt;/i&gt;.
Find the demon-hunter Jahan.
*He screams on, but with another&apos;s voice. An elven child, in terror and in pain - &apos;the fog! The fog! The fog!&apos; Those screams will never leave you, even after your death.*
Linder, I fear, is far too busy with his little coup.
*Muse that in your experience, dwarves make the best lovers. Surprisingly.*
Fane? Traitor! Destroyer! Your suffering shall be eternal!
I abide. While the God King lives, this place is my only refuge. My flames must stay contained.
*Tell him that Blaithin said to mention her name; can you go downstairs now?*
Little people? Like me, you mean? I guess.
*Decline. These Dreamers spout nothing but nonsense.*
Do that again. I dare you.
Safe Haven
Oh flesh, does your impudence know no bounds? You dare pretend you do not know the might Rask - necromancer to Braccus Rex himself? You disgust me.
Ryker accepted a &apos;promise&apos;, but now wishes to be free of this pact. We should see what he has to say about this.
Vitality and Armour percentages of characters in target area are summed up and redistributed equally.
Easy there, lover boy! I&apos;m on your side! I&apos;m here to make &lt;i&gt;absolutely certain&lt;/i&gt; you put a bun in the princess&apos; lovely little oven, even if we have to hold you down to do it!
*Keep distracting the White Magister. Is that an Order-issued sword he wields?*
*Be on your way.*
Wanted Poster
*Press the button.*
Surface
*Wince and say that looks tremendously painful.*
Buddy! *Howl!* MY Buddy. But... Work. Search. Sourcerers? Why! Buddy...
*Nod back.*
These papers say you&apos;re an inquisitor. You don&apos;t look like an inquisitor. You don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;smell &lt;/i&gt;like an inquisitor.
*Drag a line of ink across his name, final as the grave.*
[RED PRINCE] *Let your thoughts wonder to the palaces you have lost. To the titles and the power. Their loss fills you with dread.*
Flaming Sword
*Reach out and pinch the wick with your hand. Watch as the flame flashes to nothing.*
*Allow the vision to pass.*
And you&apos;re just... just... I don&apos;t even know &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; you are. Now leave my sight, lest I make an unseemly squeal.

Find the trader Zaleskar.
For I am an elf. The tongue of others is not my tongue. You may speak of then and when, I do not. I refuse to learn their strange speech!
WHY COULDN&apos;T YOU JUST *whimper* GO!
*Tell Malady you&apos;ve found the candle&apos;s spirit. Unusually, it belongs to someone who isn&apos;t yet dead.*
Stickies
Ah &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt;. You don&apos;t look like you have it in you, long-leggedy Freddy...
*He shrugs, looking off to the side.*
Look - take it, all right? I&apos;ll report it stolen. Just... go, will you?
*Inside you, your god rumbles in protest.*
Hmmm? What? You be needin&apos; something from me, lad? Ain&apos;t much inclined to rub elbows with humans if you catch my drift.
&apos;Unworthy&apos; she said. &apos;Unworthy to be Divine,&apos; so she gave it to another.

*The chef had Magister goods? She must be the murderer! Release the spirit.*
Oh, I do hope that little so-and-so hasn&apos;t been &lt;i&gt;talking&lt;/i&gt;. Those chains were in place for a reason...

Verse For A Winter&apos;s Morn, by Cranley Huwbert
Now Sebille. We must talk. It is time for you to fulfill your destiny.
The harlot Gratiana has a lot to answer for. If not for the poison she dripped into our lord&apos;s ear, we would have flesh and freedom today.
Right. Of course. It&apos;s just, Malady mentioned the thing in my head&apos;s probably a demon. And there there&apos;s someone close to where we&apos;re headed who might be able to help me with it.
Ah, there you are, *ahem*, &lt;i&gt;wife!&lt;/i&gt;
Almira&apos;s Refuge
Red Prince, Your Majesty, I am Brahmos the Wanderer, leader of the House of Dreams and - unbeknownst to you - your greatest champion.
Lead me to her, Brahmos. Show me the way.
Listen to me: I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; the House of Shadows. This is my role. I see the great games in motion: allow them their flux when they advance for good, cut them short when they advance for evil - even if that means &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt; evil.
*Mock his loyalty. He might as well tell you; the God King will have no use for him now.*&lt;br&gt;
Find. Out.
*Creak...* Attend to your studies.
Purged Magister

[SCHOLAR] *Ask him what he sees.*

Remove Trompdoy&apos;s cursed ring.
Generations of work, just strewn across the floor...
Are you sure you want nothing in return for that?
