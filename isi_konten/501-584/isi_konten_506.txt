*Shake your head. This is all too much for you.*
Use a repair hammer to mend damaged equipment.
I owe our Shield my life several times over; I hardly need to grovel and thank it each time. I&apos;m sure it knows I appreciate it...
Needing a new bow, shorty?
*Hold her close*
Well, this is what&apos;s available. Take it or leave it. And I suggest you take it. It&apos;s better to regret something you did than something you didn&apos;t do. Am I right?
Another victim to the Voidwoken.
*Say you&apos;d have thought she was a Master of the Source herself.*
Live, love and liquidate. From death let me be death...
*His back suddenly arches as he spasms in pain.*
Wrecking Twohander
Saheila. You are all right!
*The dwarf turns, startled by your voice. There&apos;s a look of panic in his rich blue eyes.*
*Kerban stares at the body of his dead comrade, tightly gripping his weapon in a cold fury.*
*She scrambles to her feet, hurt and embarrassed.*
Sorry, but not under my watch. You might go pissin&apos; in the market at high noon, but I gotta go by the rulebook here.
*Tell her to go ahead.*
FAILURE
Never was good at knowin&apos; when to fold.
Find Sanders the Toymaker.
*Wave her away. You didn&apos;t do it for her...*
*Take your leave.*
If you want my soul, you&apos;ll have to take it by force. &lt;i&gt;Try, and it&apos;ll cost you your life.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shake your head. How can this be? She was dashed upon the shore!*
It is done. And quickly. I thank you. Very, very much.
Eliya Kristanial
All I want now is for this to end; to be by your side when we wage the final battle.
Bring the Weaver some flesh.
[LIZARD] It&apos;s Deathfog. They didn&apos;t have time to scream. It was a kindness, really.
The Gift of the Blackroot
*Laugh and say she hasn&apos;t changed at all.*
The Paladins attacked our barracks. I ran... not that it helped.
*In the shadows, a dwarven woman spits obscenities down upon a caged Voidwoken. She exudes a powerful air of menace... and an even more powerful odour of old sweat and dried blood. She spies you. And &lt;i&gt;glowers.*&lt;/i&gt;
[MYSTIC] *Open yourself to the statue. Allow it to see the truth.*
The wounded bridgekeeper asked for our help.
My name is Sadha. I thought you knew.
Investigate the ancient temple.
[2] was killed
At his tomb we found Lucian, alive and conspiring with Dallis to purge the world of its Source, that the Void could never again pierce the Veil. This was the plan all along.
You&apos;ve found an &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Identifying Glass&lt;/font&gt;! If your Loremaster ability is high enough, you&apos;ll be able to identify items. Press [IE_ContextMenu] on any unidentified item and select &apos;Identify&apos;.
Gareth went looking for weapons. He hasn&apos;t returned.
Ah, Braccus Rex. I&apos;ve read his history - quite gruesome, even for a human.
I&apos;m curious to see how long he&apos;ll last. He&apos;s a good man, which makes him a dubious god.
Who knows what secrets may have hidden behind that curtain? But my King forbade any further investigation.
I never thought I would wish for silence again after the tomb, but I rather agree.
Next Level [1]: increases base Attitude with strangers by [2].
Resistance
*She takes your hand, holds it to her lips, and kisses your fingertips. She cradles her face in your palm for a moment, eyes closed, before letting your hand go.*
*Cluck, clu... Bock? Bock!? BACAW!*
That&apos;s probably the wisest thing you&apos;ll say all day.
Show Chat
Well that explains the smell, anyway.
*Ask him what he meant earlier by &apos;the secret of his soul&apos;.*
*Note that you don&apos;t see any White Magisters amongst the dead - what came of them?*
[1] increases the distance you can throw objects and how heavy they can be.
*The nurse hisses at you while you remain in earshot.*
*She takes another drink from her goblet, her eyes flashing pink again.*
Manage Stickies
*Say that the days of &apos;less than a king&apos; draw to an end.*
Goodness me! Well, then, do what you wish. Never let it be said that Paulina Kemm is a discourteous hostess.
*Say he looks a little thin and give the dog some fish.*
A traitor receives justice. It is a familiar tale. But another of our trees is lost. I mourn.
She kept me here to do her bidding - until you took her flagship from right under her nose, it seems.
*The Magister nods.*
Ah - then you know we both would see Isbeil dead and the Black Ring scattered to the winds. Let us seal our partnership, then, and put an end to the God King, Beast. Or is it... Marcus?
The severed arm of the seer, Saheila.
Save campaign as
Keep your eyes peeled, would you? Brahmos the Wanderer promised he&apos;d be here...
Maybe... &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt;...
I love you too.
*Hunger rises deep within you. You - or the thing inside you - wants his Source, so badly you can taste it.*
He never discovered what that was.
You throw yourself at death. So be it.
*Smirk and wonder what would happen if you were to tell a Magister.*
*Take Shadow&apos;s Eye, line up a shot at a nearby tree and fire.*
*Ask if you&apos;re supposed to eat the mushroom raw too.*
Distinctive Amadouvier
*Tell her no, you didn&apos;t speak to any such person.*
Enjoy the show? There&apos;s more where that came from.
Oh, I can measure the vile depths of your prevarications by the very pulse of this bleeding forest.
Sword Kit Part III: Blade
*Start with the horses. They&apos;re in a tavern, at a table, talking about the race they just ran. The waiter comes over.*
I feel better already. Need to fatten meself up a bit again so I don&apos;t lose it a second time. Can&apos;t be relying on mercenaries like you to dig me out! Can&apos;t afford it!
They caught me when I failed to correctly respond to their questions and dragged me here.
We defeated Alexandar. We can now board the Magister flagship anchored offshore and escape the island.
Their dedication to their cause is almost admirable. If one could admire a pack of red-cloaked baboons.
This... this isn&apos;t the Veil, but the technology looks curiously familiar.
*The Red Prince approaches a Lizard Dreamer. He bids the Dreamer stand up and pay attention. The Dreamer obeys in a grovelling and awkward manner.*
Victory! Long live the king!
There were others. But they fall like crabapples from their branches. Someone else looks for Godwoken. Not to liberate them... but to kill them.
Ah, guilty as sin, I see. Well, I doubt anyone would miss a thief like you.
*Tell her it was very kind of them to care for Hannag, considering the consequences.*
This clown? Caught &apos;im stealing from my kitchen. *Ahem* Still won&apos;t say where he stashed my supplies. Sound like someone you&apos;d let off with a slap on the wrist?
But... it underestimates you. It has not seen the great well of power within you. It cannot fathom to what heights you will ascend.
Fancy Dagger
You... accident? You -
It takes a while to work. Here, let me mark your map while I wait. Look, where that drop of spit landed. It&apos;s there.
*He nods thoughtfully, and even smiles, rubbing the life back into his bloodless hands.*
Jahan has the arch-demon&apos;s name: Adramahlihk. He&apos;s in Arx, masquerading as &apos;Doctor Daeva&apos;.
*The lever part of the lock mechanism seems to be missing. There is no prise with which to open the door.*
Leave me be. Please.
*...and with a rending, tearing sound that fills the whole wide world, your jester&apos;s soul, your sense of humour - as much a part of you as was your heart - is torn away, and you are left empty and bereft.*
*Ask if it knows another tune.*
There&apos;s no way we could have known... but even in these times, one doesn&apos;t expect the Voidwoken to appear at a &lt;i&gt;wedding&lt;/i&gt;.
Few were as prepared for the new world as the lizardkin of the Ancient Empire.
My people! The world is ours once more. The reign of thieves is at an end. These so-called &apos;races&apos; will be our slaves. And our foodstock.
*She kisses you. She devours you. Suddenly she&apos;s all blinding light and come-hither heat.*
*&apos;Make them pay...&apos;*
We spoke with a rat who recalls that Dallis controlled the ship by singing from a strange song book.
Chapter 7 - To Be Divine
Well, I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; sell Sourcerous Sundries, don&apos;t I? It&apos;d be a bit hypocritical for me not to use my own products.
We&apos;ll make our way to the lake, but not yet: Not until you&apos;ve become a true Master of the Source. You&apos;ll need to learn to speak the language of creation itself.
[SCHOLAR] *Your stomach does a somersault. This must be an Arena of the One - home to a fabled cult of battle. Ask her to tell you more.*
*Look for the bees - maybe they&apos;re still around.*
[Translate92_eeca6f0d-d3b4-4c32-a3d8-67eb3140e8ba]
Duna&apos;s brow, I need to get off this ship!
Runes
*Cry out to Lucian. Was &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; part of his plan?*
The God King sends his regards, by the way, on this the occasion of your death. He&apos;s sorry, but you will &lt;i&gt;never &lt;/i&gt;see Lucian. It can&apos;t be allowed. No Godwoken will enter the crypt.
Brownish Amulet
Perhaps we would be better to &apos;get a move onwards&apos;?
Have you managed to rummage up any turnips?
*Introduce yourself. And she is...?*
I couldn&apos;t agree more.
Let&apos;s see how they react. Hopefully the Hammer is onto something...
Too many.
[LOHSE] *Imitate her voice exactly: &apos;And so on and so forth...&apos;*
Ryker petitioned the newly risen Divine
M-my teeth w-w-won&apos;t stop c-chattering!
It&apos;s a special device that carries only a very special cargo. Specifically: Deathfog.
*Tell them you&apos;re here with Glenna&apos;s blessing.*
...no caste will tolerate a stain.
Some truths are simply... known.
Don&apos;t like conversations? This intimidating axe can provide the final answer to any questions.
*Your body is still, but your soul floats upwards. You see yourself when you look down. Content. Safe.*
We all want to survive. Just sleep through one more day, but they won&apos;t let us. Won&apos;t... won&apos;t stop...
Weakened
Millennia later, adventurers would come in search of the legendary Divine City of Arx and the crypt of the great Lucian. None would pass the Path of Blood.
*Say you&apos;ve heard of her. You met her boy Barin across the river.*
Lovrik
(end)
*Wonder why he&apos;s outside the gates if he loves graveyards so much.*
Oh darling, I&apos;ve forgotten you already.
You must be feeling the loss of Malady rather sorely... or perhaps not. Death is a frequent companion of yours, isn&apos;t it? Perhaps you&apos;re inured.
Until later, Godwoken. May you, too, know truth.
Campaign Description
*Consume the spirit&apos;s precious Source. He will never roam the Hall.*
Lobby creation failed
*Grease his palm once more.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*She leaps into your arms and plants a huge, wet kiss on your mouth.*
Priestess of Amadia?! I&apos;ve known cheese more holy than her. She were the one that helped Braccus to power, and lead him down his dark path.
Lemme guess - there&apos;s only enough for one of us? Yeah, thought so.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast, still bearing the strange lamp.
Move along,&lt;i&gt; merc.&lt;/i&gt; You&apos;re in the way.
Well, you&apos;re painting me into a corner here, friend... and I don&apos;t like to be cornered.
[LIZARD] *Declare that those fish aren&apos;t fit for even a slave to eat.*
As I was called to be. I am yours to command; my will is of no consequence, even as we sail into darkness. And so, as I must, I say...
Oh, Quercus. She might have been a butchered tree, but she still made a noble home. And now our nest is gone.
*She pinches your cheek, a sparkle in her dim, grey eyes.*
