Remember your lupine motto - &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar&apos;&lt;/i&gt; - that may be just the thing to keep you safe. I wish I could offer you more in return for finding Anathema, but alas...
Seeking Revenge
*Breathe deeply and comment that you seem to smell... oranges about him.*
&lt;i&gt;While Dallis sought the Aeteran, I started draining the Gods of their Source.&lt;/i&gt;
Never mind, Lohse. Let him listen if he&apos;s so very interested.
But I trust you.
*With a barely perceptible nod, he acknowledges your presence.*
So?
Singer? I  don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any Singer. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
Laced Scale Boots
You save us all. You save us &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;.
Ah. Our undead Godwoken. I had nearly forgotten.
Min Vorr
The bitter march of humans unabated...
Off to prison with you. You&apos;ll have plenty of time to dwell on your crimes in there.
*Confirm his suspicion. Dorian&apos;s offered you quite a sum to do the deed.*
Disembodied Lizard Leg
*Question her about the Black Ring.*
I&apos;ll be honoured to join you.
Blessed be - perhaps there &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;hope for the world!
&lt;i&gt;You make him pay&lt;/i&gt;.
*He holds your gaze with a steely calm, until you turn away.*
Shield of Braccus Rex
Heart of the Tyrant
It&apos;s good to be on the open seas again...
*She cradles her head in her hands, then pivots towards the prisoner. Her mouth opens, yet nothing spills forth - no sermon, no screed, no threat. She turns back to you and grimaces.*
*Say you&apos;d like to learn a little more about that contraption she&apos;s working on first... how did she come by it?*
Now, I&apos;ll beg your pardon and get back to settling things in here. Don&apos;t need to paint a target on our little den by gabbing with you all day!
No it is not, for that boil you mistake for a brain couldn&apos;t possibly fathom the depth of my contempt.
*She stares uncomprehendingly at your outstretched hand, slowly raising a bewildered gaze to meet your eyes. She &lt;i&gt;stares&lt;/i&gt;, and you feel yourself drawn into the mesmerising Source pools of her eyes.*
Don&apos;t you have somewhere to be? Somewhere &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt;, I mean...
[SCHOLAR] *Nod in agreement. Much can be learned from the dead.*
Health
Go! Leave me be, slave.
What are you waiting for, a red carpet? Move it.
xxhhhhhnnNNOO!
Thank you.
*Her fists suddenly clench into balls and she leans toward you.*
[LOHSE] *Your fans used to toss these on-stage. Say they make you feel a little sad.*
I&apos;ll give you that knuckle if you keep carrying on.
*Promise it&apos;ll be a fun little trip, and before she knows it she&apos;ll be back with her family.*
Oil Dazzler Grenade
Another cadaver? Clearly we were not the only ones to suffer Braccus&apos;s wrath.
Perhaps in one of Braccus&apos;s vaults. They are scattered across this isle - one cannot know which have been ransacked and which left secure.
Squuuuueeeaaak!
Elven treeeees *hmm mmm mmm*
Justinia&apos;s always been a looker...
The core of the pocket realm is dangerously unstable. To stay safe, we must &apos;follow the pipes&apos;.
*He nods once, decisively.*
*Tell him you&apos;d like to know more about the engineers of the catacombs.*
In their zeal for killing Sourcerers, they killed one of their own. I fought in the Great War, and killed the Black Ring. I never thought the trophy I took from them would get me killed.
What have we here? Didn&apos;t find what I went looking for, but it still seems you have a knack for finding trouble. You&apos;re under arrest!
To the Hall of Echoes
A DRA MAH LIHK!
One candle soul was a villain who&apos;d evaded justice with Adramahlihk&apos;s help. To weaken the demon, flame and soul must die.
School Registration Records
*Ask the automaton who - or what - it is.*
Magical Two-Handed Human Axe
*The Magister wipes his bloodied face with a grimy rag as he strides towards you. Eyes narrowing with suspicion, he halts several feet away, one hand on the hilt of his weapon.*
Please - take the Swornbreaker, and forgive my cruelty. Be free, Windego.
Like I don&apos;t know that. They think I&apos;m a Sourcerer. They&apos;re wrong.
A delicious blend. I envy the lady&apos;s brewing skills.
Back! &lt;i&gt;Back&lt;/i&gt;, Magister! I-I-I&apos;ll kill you, just like the rest of them!
*Stretching far as you can, hold out your pack for her to rummage in.*
My thoughts exactly.
Goblin Swashbuckler
*Sir Lora turns to you, his beady eyes shining with pride.*
You poor, &lt;i&gt;old &lt;/i&gt;thing. Feeling your advancing age, are you? Well, no matter. I don&apos;t mind repeating myself if I must. I&apos;ll even use language any simpleton can understand.
Sa&apos;e old story, usual story. &apos;ade the &apos;istake of &apos;eing a good and &apos;ro&apos;er worker. I was a &apos;rofessional! Lost &apos;y head for it. Or as it turns out, lost &apos;y &apos;ody... &apos;y &apos;ody... the rest of &apos;e.
Kemm&apos;s Letter to Arhu
Vallie
*Appeal to your lizard lover for help.*
Use to start digging on the spot. Who knows what you might find?
*Explain that Dallis went to the Cathedral - she&apos;s after Lucian&apos;s tomb!*
In a place where the dead were not allowed to rest, you will find the most precious of life.
You&apos;re loyal or you aren&apos;t, and if you aren&apos;t, then people die. &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt; die. See the captain if you will, adventurer. maybe he&apos;ll put some work your way. You can follow your own path all you wish.
Why should I believe you? You&apos;ve got guilt written all over you.
Garvan
You know their order, my friend. Mystic squirrel knights, sworn to the Great Acorn, trying to bring about its return.
Barin, meet my new pal. New pal, meet Barin.
But beware, Sadha is ultimately dangerous. Not only can she be the mother of dragons, I fear she&apos;s fallen in with an old enemy. &lt;i&gt;Them.&lt;/i&gt;

*Pick the flower.*
The Magisters slayed him in cold blood.
Honey. I can see what you are, plain as day, and I know what I can give you. This isn&apos;t about a little rough and tumble. It&apos;s about that longing in you. The one that nags.
Ho! Such generosity of spirit, such courage and conviction! It seems I have chosen well.
With a single gesture, Braccus Rex could raze an army. Yet he could not have done so had he not stood on the shoulders of giants.
Suppose I don&apos;t. I&apos;m no assassin. Just a fletcher. Roost heard about my work and... invited me to work here.
*He shoots you a flinty look, all teeth and peril.*
Abilities shape &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;what&lt;/font&gt; characters can do and &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;how well&lt;/font&gt; they do it.
He said his name. Barely even knew that much, but still...
Ah. Of course...
Selector Move Forward
You flatter me, my prince, but if all I had to do was give, you would long since have received.
Now hurry! Get out of here before...
*Crunch* *SNAP!*
Rail against Dallis. Rail against me. But you cannot stop what must be done.
You better hope I don&apos;t find anything suspicious in here.
*The lid flies open with a metallic squeal. A one-armed skeleton clad in a pristine coat unfolds himself from inside the chest.*&lt;br&gt;
*Say you&apos;d rather find solace with someone special than a gang of thugs.*
[BARBARIAN] *Nod and smile. That just means when you&apos;re done slicing Justinia&apos;s throat, he&apos;ll be next on the list.*
[IFAN] *Tell her that you follow your own damned self.*
Eagle-Eyed Guardian
Name of Migo. Nice to meet you. Thank you.
*Stare at her curiously. Why must you be the first? What could you&lt;i&gt; &apos;&lt;/i&gt;be&apos;?*
*The man shudders with the revulsion of a zealot, eyes rolling with disbelief.*
Now leave me be - my Magister comrades have been disappearing, and I&apos;m going to find out who.
Combat Hotbar
That said, I&apos;ve the distinct feeling I wasn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt; to die today, for despite your heroics I was still cast into the water. I sank. I drowned...
Silencing Stare Skillbook
*After a few more minutes&apos; struggle, it slumps to the ground, defeated, and its contemptuous eyes return to you.*
*Pat him on the back and say how lucky he is to have such a  talented boss!*
Hmm. Yes.
Once, I was an elf... I passed away and was reborn as an ancestor tree, in a beautiful forest surrounded by kin of both flesh and root...
Radius: [1]&lt;br&gt;Duration: [2]&lt;br&gt;Wet makes target less resistant to air spells but more resistant to fire spells.
Mmmmmmmm...
I do not help you, Roost Anlon. Ever.
I told you already - my secrets die with me.
*Confront Dallis. She thought mere magic could contain an evil this tremendous?*
Of course. You&apos;re right. Lets... keep moving.
He made his own choice, and this is the result.
*You &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;make him sorry.*
I know I talk a lot. But I don&apos;t talk about the Isle of Mists that much. No reason to, most of the time.
NOOOOOOOOoooo&lt;i&gt;ooooooarrgh!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The spirit of Vilnx Creeva is now at peace, and has departed this world.
*Refuse. You can&apos;t. It&apos;s too much of a risk!*
*Cough.*
So, you&apos;re the one I&apos;ve been hearing about. Gave something to the Magisters, I hear. Something that &lt;i&gt;wasn&apos;t yours &lt;/i&gt;to give.
Deal with Withermoore&apos;s Soul Jar.
*Play the fool and ask him what he means.*
A pretty silver pendant adorned with a sapphire.
My Lord, I beg you. Make me whole!
It&apos;s a good enough verse. Lizard&apos;s ain&apos;t so bad, really.
And what kind of Divine was Fane, the Eternal, as the world battled the demons?
Well, I didn&apos;t, and I don&apos;t. But you don&apos;t need to look at &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;that way.
lost to time like sand in the wind.
Yes! Devour us all and true power will be bestowed upon you.
A character with [1] will find certain secrets throughout the game.
I was still alive, when she started cutting pieces off me. She wanted me to feel it. All of it.
*With a groan of dread, snatch the black heart from his hand and quickly bite into it.*
You are the fool. The doors to you are closed. Braccus Rex is just.
Don&apos;t listen to Malady; you made the right choice. I stand by you completely.
*Jahan steps aside and snarls at you:*
*The dwarf moves his jaw at odd angles, as though he&apos;s unused to speaking.*
*Say you&apos;re glad no blood was shed over the matter.*
*Say you&apos;re looking for an elemental powerhouse - a Wizard will do.*
Phoenix Hatchling
Yes, I heard it too. The man has some curious ideas about what constitutes treason.
I can help you, my friend. Shall we join forces? Shall we work together?
[FANE] *Dip your head in a show of humility. Even if you are the rather obvious choice...*
There, now... just like that...
The Lone Wolf Roost Anlon is hiding in an old sawmill somewhere outside Driftwood.
*You get it: you can never be more than a passing fancy.*
Search the Magister barracks.
Paladin DeSelby, you have been declared guilty of insubordination.
Blunt
The new king ruled with grace and integrity.
*Tell her that if she&apos;d wanted that gold for food or shelter, you might&apos;ve obliged.*
Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. A Godwoken. But there&apos;s no divinity to be had, is there? Not for you and not for me.
*Say goodbye.*
Silver Plate
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are my Godwoken.

Find out what Brahmos wanted.
We wished for riches, and the Djinn gave us a necklace.
