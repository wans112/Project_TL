Nimble Vault
And then I took her place; face-rippers are such marvels, aren&apos;t they? It didn&apos;t take long to realise that Lucian was the key to my vengeance - and I was the key to the salvation of Rivellon.
Spirit of a Mob Victim
*He whispers &lt;i&gt;&apos;Glechou dumar, glechou dumar&apos; &lt;/i&gt;over and over, and suddenly you seem to hear the chattering of thousands of elven voices in the distance.*
Withermoore&apos;s Soul Jar
*This door is locked tight, but there&apos;s a sliding hatch at ankle height. Grains of sand drift from beneath the door and form the tiniest dunes.*
*The spirit looks to you, confused.*
An empty vial.
Get rid of Murga.
We all know Fane. We all know the one who turned his back on the Eternals. On &lt;i&gt;us.&lt;/i&gt;
Hilarious. I&apos;ve always thought that life is comedy, not tragedy. And along comes further proof!
*A rough hand seizes you. Bright light blinds you. There you are.*
Well... now I know what true evil looks like. Beautiful on the outside. Breathtaking, even. And wrought from... pain. Destruction.
A dripping, pulpy mass of mushy wood and water. Better dry it out before it soaks through your whole pack!
You&apos;re not wrong. If Gareth is safe, my job here is done. I&apos;ll go find the others and get the hells off this island. I suggest you do the same.
And what would you presume &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;means?
*The demon throws its head back, its harsh, rasping laughter echoing in your ears.*
*She calmly opens her left eye, then her right.*
*Say that power, once yours, will be yours to wield as you see fit.*
In this world you make your own luck.
Do you think I&apos;d just take your word for it? You&apos;re dripping with guilt.
Magical Double Headed Hammer
They&apos;ll all get what they deserve. You can join them if you like - otherwise you can shut your trap.
*Divine? Ask if that&apos;s the endpoint of all this.*
Hope you gave some thought to what I said. It&apos;s a mean world out there. If you&apos;ve got someone willing to travel it with you... well, you&apos;re in good shape.
I will remember you, you know. And to be remembered by an eternal god is, in its own way, a special sort of immortality.
For 2 turns, your target character&apos;s Vitality cannot be reduced below 1 point, keeping them alive against all odds. If the target is a summon, their lifetime will be prolonged for the duration.
Max AP
Be quick. Make no mistake: The Order will be upon us in due time.
*Tell him that the path is clear.*
*You don&apos;t appreciate her tone. Attack her.*
Why, thank you. You&apos;ll find I don&apos;t live up to expectations with remarkable frequency.
Its name is of no importance! Only its efficacy. And it is very effective. It kills &apos;Gods&apos;.
You&apos;re too kind.
I&apos;ll be down guardin&apos; Mordus. It gets cold down in that vault - figured a drink or two to guard against the chill wouldn&apos;t hurt, eh?
Summon gains increased Physical Resistance and Armour and an additional Necromancer skill (depending on summon).
No. Let the Ancestor show you. You never serve again -
Dragon Attack 02
I&apos;ve never known Lord Arhu to willingly approve anyone who seeks to enter the Divine&apos;s tomb - I can&apos;t imagine it has anything to do with his disappearance.
Awrite, lizard! Right glad Lohar ain&apos;t left us here to wither.
*Correct him. He is to call you &lt;i&gt;Beast.*&lt;/i&gt;
Subject: Human Male&lt;br&gt;Formulation: DF-12&lt;br&gt;Observations: Expected results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Dwarf Female&lt;br&gt;Formulation: DF-12&lt;br&gt;Observations: Expected results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Human Female Sourcerer&lt;br&gt;Formulation: DF-13&lt;br&gt;Observations: Unusual. Subject resisted initial muscular petrification and lung atrophy, and lived seven minutes beyond typical expectancy. Post-test dissection revealed most brain matter still largely healthy.&lt;br&gt;Hypothesis: Sourcerers possess greater resistance to Deathfog - and Godwoken may be even more resilient.
You certainly made it out fine, didn&apos;t you? You made &lt;i&gt;quite &lt;/i&gt;sure of that, from what I hear.
*The spirit is as a stone: quiet and steadfast.*
That&apos;s as likely as breaking through a stone wall with a wooden spoon. Ignorant fool, to think that Magisters have his best interests at heart.
*Say you&apos;re not sure. You knew of him, but you never talked to him yourself.*
I know I crossed a line. But it wasn&apos;t a line between &apos;good&apos; and &apos;bad&apos;. It was a line between... knowing and not knowing.
&lt;i&gt;What? &lt;/i&gt;The armour speaks - but you are too &lt;i&gt;loud.&lt;/i&gt;
*The boy shakes his head in denial, then beams like the summer sun. You see yourself in him, from a simpler time when the future looked bright and endless.*
I accept, and forget what I see.
*Laughs.* Sendin&apos; swine to kill a pig! That be right. Yow&apos;ll find Lucian&apos;s brat with the elves, way northwards. If yow don&apos;t find death before it.
*Take a wild guess: She&apos;s going to hit the road with a bunch of filthy &apos;artists&apos; in get her old band back together.*
Murder Victim
Black Cat
*Nod. You understand. You&apos;re glad he&apos;s with his people once more.*
The light in Adramahlihk&apos;s home plane remains undimmed, and the demon retains his strength.
Online
We are at war. I don&apos;t relish knowing there will be... civilian casualties. But they are necessary. The Order soon comes for the Dwarven Kingdom. Consider it a... pre-emptive strike.
Hm. Never was one for lute-lessons.
You surprised? You&apos;re one of &apos;em. You know what Sourcerers are capable of. Whoever did this found a way around their collar and killed a man.
Do the Divine Order tend our needs when they steal our lands, torture us, murder us?
It&apos;s only lust then, this fire I&apos;m feeling? Such a pity...
Fire resistance: [1][2]%&lt;br&gt;
What? I was just bein&apos; pleasant before. It doesn&apos;t mean you have to keep talking to me...
The possessed prisoners are held in the vaults by the power of their dead jailor priests.
*The spirit grins as he sees you, a grin that contains madness, or something as close to it as makes no difference.*
*Ask what you should do now. He must have an idea.*
Hrg...
*The man before you writhes in pain, oblivious to you. Otherworldly shackles are coiled all around him.*
Go hence, learn, and do not tarry. The King and his Void allies grow stronger with every passing hour.
*From behind its unmoving lips, you hear a noise. It starts as a groaning, croaking chatter, but slowly becomes more distinct - it&apos;s speaking!*
*Ifan shrugs and shoots you a wry smile.*
*Kill it.*
[BEAST] *Recall the power building inside you: the swelling wind and roaring seas. Unleash it!*
*The knight looks up at you as you reach inside yourself, summoning your Source. The ghost of a smile on his lips.*
Go, mortal. Draw. My claws ache for your flesh.
I pledge my heart, O Lucian, please return. And you, pilgrim, should do the same.
You pray, if it gives you solace.
Find a Purging Wand for Gareth.
I don&apos;t believe we have anything further to say to each other, child of the grave.
*Jahan takes Lohse&apos;s hands and begins inhaling slowly, deeply, then exhaling audibly through his mouth. Lohse&apos;s breaths match his.*
Stairs to Main Floor
*Tell them not to worry; you&apos;ll take care of the Silent Monks.*
*Inform her she&apos;s a squatter, and she needs to find a new home. This one&apos;s yours.*
Edit
*You pass through the door and are suddenly face-to-face with an undead. His skull is bizarrely angular, and a glorious jewel sits in the middle of his forehead.*
Do you take me for a fool? You&apos;ll pay for your insolence!
Lohse, how your mind must ache. Come here, rest. Gather your thoughts.
Perhaps. Even in war, we may find space for mercy. Very well, she will not die today.
*Point out that prisoners aren&apos;t usually held in the master cabin - why was he here?*
*Shake your head and take your leave.*
*She gives you a long look, unsure... then decides.*
*Say elemental surfaces make no sense and you avoid using them.*
Outsmarted the creepy crawlies, did you? Good show! Though we seem to be one short still.
*He smiles at you, but his expression is grave.*
Eddie
*He eyes the heap piled with his rotting hands, eyes, heart. An iridescent tear rolls down his cheek. His voice rumbles in his throat.*
*Pay the toll.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
They thought themselves well in control. But there is only one master scheme that must come to fruition: &lt;b&gt;MY DIVINITY!&lt;/b&gt;
*Laugh, and say you&apos;ve never heard anything so preposterous.*
We gave Almira the Swornbreaker. She&apos;ll free herself of the God King&apos;s covenant. She promised to help us when the time comes.

*Sigh in agreement. Your exile to that demonic isle could have been the end of you.*
Well, I never! Why, you would question my commitment to my sweet little buttercup? The honey in my tea, the bee in my bonnet, the sugar in my bowl? Perish the idea.
*It begins with a spark in your belly, then grows to a full-blown flame. No amount of energy can counter the fire burning you from within. You hear his voice once more as your life slips away.*
Frightfully busy at the moment, love. You take care of yourself, now.
Medium
Oddballs? Yes! Like you and me.
You know I&apos;ve been a host all my life. I can&apos;t imagine what it&apos;s like to be anything else. And it&apos;s no secret that the beings I&apos;ve hosted have influenced my music - a lot.
The Feats of the Four
Demonic Ram
Bow Kit Part I: String
*Ask if he&apos;s alright. Apart from being dead, obviously.*
Slipping
That&apos;s better... nrgh... up and at &apos;em. We need to get off this island...
You&apos;ll always look ready for a battle in chainmail pants. Your actual readiness is, of course, up to you.
Notched with the kills he made with it, this bow once belonged to Delorus.
Bronze
*Accept.*
*You sense an opportunity. Say &apos;she&apos; sent you to collect all the group&apos;s valuables - she needs every last piece of gold before moving forward.*
We&apos;d better find a way inside before it all goes up in smoke... and us with it.
*Ask them for milk.*
And I won&apos;t rest until I know &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;Lucian didn&apos;t wait.
*Tell the hound that isn&apos;t true; some people can be resurrected.*
Careful you don&apos;t get in the way up there, pretty. Kari&apos;s blade is ready, &apos;n&apos; I doubt she&apos;ll be caring much who or what she slices.
*Say it was a pleasure being of service.*
Arthropod Leg
Easy. I&apos;d say we get out of this place. Dunno how long they plan to keep us here, but I&apos;d rather not find out.
*Even a triple-sized troll couldn&apos;t make the statue budge. Whatever the stone figure guards remains a mystery - at least for now.*
Ice bear
Lord Wirb
*Say &apos;goodnight&apos;.*
Laser Ray
*She startles at your forwardness and lunges towards you. In that moment, the hanging Sourcerer breaks free of his ropes, proudly displaying a dagger he&apos;d hidden in his palm.*
Were I to ambush a mark, this ravine would be perfect.
What... what is that thing?!
It&apos;s broken already, and I don&apos;t think &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;touch is going to make it any more fixed.
[1] is still [2]
[SCHOLAR] *You have an idea. Tell him you want his sword.*
You have made a pact with a demon. You are blood-bound. The bond will be difficult to break.
Very good, very good. Now, back to the study...
*Say: &lt;i&gt;&apos;You.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Laugh and say you finally understand. But you&apos;re not a Sourcerer: you seek to become a &lt;i&gt;Magister&lt;/i&gt;. Where can you sign up?*
Yes. We squalled like children until the bogeyman came for us in the night.
*Tell him not to worry - you&apos;re going to save him.*
I may have used the phrase &apos;pathetic mortals.&apos; Come to think of it, I may have used it several times...
Mihaly
