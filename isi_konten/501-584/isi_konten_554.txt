*Brush off his question; you can&apos;t be responsible for a kid right now.*
Doomblade
*Say you&apos;ll relax once you&apos;re out of this place for good.*
*Envisage &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;setting a blade to &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;throat.*
My love is gone, I&apos;m left forlorn&lt;br&gt;For to the God King is she Sworn&lt;br&gt;She rides a pale white unicorn&lt;br&gt;And blows the God King&apos;s horn&lt;br&gt;She looked at me with hate and scorn&lt;br&gt;Because I refused to be reborn&lt;br&gt;My love is gone, I&apos;m left to mourn&lt;br&gt;
*Smirk and say that even &lt;i&gt;without &lt;/i&gt;power, you&apos;re both plenty corrupt.*
*Your unswerving confidence unsettles him. Doubt clouds his eyes for the first time.*
Cut
What a prize! The Master will be pleased.
*The puppet&apos;s words choke off. It spasms and flares with Source. Then it is still once more... and a different voice emerges from within:*
But I can still help! Here, this is a sign of my good will. And a sign that I want to get the hell out of here.
Good riddance. I never met a more sour soul in my life.
*Demand to know what the voice is.*
Investigate the cliff-top statue.
I saw that. I&apos;m starting to dislike you.
*Tell him you&apos;ll never forget him.*
We have learned that there&apos;s a place in the Hollow Marshes, beyond Fort Joy, where we may be safe from the Magisters.
*She said something about &apos;going far&apos;. Ask what she meant by that.*
Animators Reference: Chair
Room for one more?
But perhaps there are still paths we can walk. Perhaps-
That whole... flesh-eatin&apos; thing. Ain&apos;t right. Ain&apos;t right in life, ain&apos;t right in poetry.
I do not want to know what that smell is.
*Look through her supplies.*
and saw the God King enslave the thieves.
*The spirit looks at its own corpse, then at you. Its horrified eyes plead with you for answers.*
Be aware that they are not your friends. They are your &lt;i&gt;rivals&lt;/i&gt;.
We&apos;re going down!
Don&apos;t make me stay here! Let me go home...
Obviously.
*Consider for a moment. Tell her it&apos;s actually still pretty noisy.*
&lt;i&gt;...his agent of death.&lt;/i&gt;
Buck rabbits are stupid! They&apos;re jumping into the fog to impress the does - but I&apos;ve yet to see any of them come back!
*You know enough. Take your leave.*
*They&apos;ll take your stuff over your dead body. Kill them!*
*The hound grabs the ball mid-air and squeaks it joyously.*
Only he knows if he atones for his sins.
*Tell him you are easily his superior in the ways of combat. If he faces you, he cannot win.*
Wall
*Show her the Swornbreaker in your possession.*
The Magisters... they arrested me in Arx. I remember being strapped to a table. They... they put something in my head... something &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;.
The Shriekers&apos; gaze isn&apos;t the only one we need to avoid, though. Bishop Alexandar is here.
Exploration Theme 06 Adventure B
Let&apos;s forget for a moment all the forces that drove us here, shall we, my prince? Let us think of nothing but ourselves, one amid a nest of satin.
&lt;i&gt;You!&lt;/i&gt; You made the Deathfog that annihilated the elves. Who do you work for? &lt;i&gt;HOW DID YOU TRICK LUCIAN?&lt;/i&gt;
That&apos;s Murga&apos;s call. I abide by &apos;er yeas and nays.
Now, now. Let&apos;s not lose our heads.
*The creature groans. Unpleasantly.*
[BARBARIAN] *Suggest he ask the pile of corpses you&apos;ve left in your wake.*
*The oblong object is crystal-clear and unmarked by marks or chips, much like the artefact you recovered on Bloodmoon Island. They are clearly two parts of the same whole.*
*Ask her how it feels to know Roost Anlon is dead.*
*Sidle up to him. Maybe he can&apos;t feel, but there&apos;s no reason you both have to be unsatisfied.*
I suppose I can franchise out my bridge-trolling system to an apprentice now...
You&apos;re a Godwoken after all. The reason some of us get out of bed each morning. What do you make of that?
Keep your wits about you, Leya. We need you.
Arrow Poison Cloud
You just found the fastest route to an early grave!
*The grieving mother manages a thin smile, even as tears stream down her ruddy face.*
*Roll your eyes and raise your weapon. Didn&apos;t you kill her once already?*
And when he does... &lt;i&gt;expect trouble.&lt;/i&gt;
*The eagle glowers at you with one baleful eye, keeping the other eye firmly trained on the stringy morsels of rotting flesh dangling from its beak.*
*Ask if their friend&apos;s name was... is... Joe.*
*Tell them you&apos;re sure their master loves them both equally, and leave it at that.*
Threadbare Pants
*The statue stands before you in silence.*
I can&apos;t take any comfort in these... holy relics. Not anymore.
*The Miasma clears as the power of your blessing skips across the surface. You look down to see your face gazing back at you, reflected in now-crystalline water.*
Now, if only I knew what the hell it was doing...
Bluegill Mushroom
Perfection.
You&apos;re clearly no Magister. Dirty face. Haphazard garb. How&apos;d you come to be here?
Etched with the graven image of a solemn crow, the poison on this claw could cut the truth from any tongue.
*The totem stares ahead silently.*
I do not know it, I &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; it. Those who despise the customs of my people will rise up and make war against us. In my dreams, I can see the battles. I can smell the blood of lizard fallen.
That means we can be made &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;cruel. Not sure Lohar&apos;ll ever be an upstandin&apos; member of his community. But he knows where t&apos;draw the lines.
*Sadness grips you at the sight of the ruined lizard consulate. So much has been lost.*
I had no choice but to lock her in my cellar. For her safety... and my own.
*Tell her there is no curse that could know if she let you be. She should leave and return to her nap.*
*Ask if she can help you locate the vault.*
I barely escaped the consulate with my life, no thanks to the Order&apos;s supposedly elite Paladins.
Truth be told, I&apos;d prefer to slip off silently, but I&apos;ll need a promise first.

*She looks you up and down. Starts to laugh. Shakes her head. &apos;No. Sorry.&apos; Studiously turns her beautiful back to you.*
Unnis
I only hope my best&apos;s enough.
Personally, I am just glad that I do not have to walk back to Reaper&apos;s Coast. Wind travel may be primitive, but it is at least efficient.
We convinced Tovah to accept our help.
Do you &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;think the future Divine should take such risks...? Besides, you&apos;re the one seeking help - perhaps you can put your murderous skills to use for the greater good.
Ethereal Storm Scroll
[RED PRINCE] *Assume he doesn&apos;t know who you are, and inform him that the Ancient Empire will have his head if he harms a single scale.*
For all his experiments and research into ancient races, he never managed to escape death. How fitting.
*Alarmed shouts and the sounds of fighting echo from another part of the Temple of Vrogir. Your guards hasten you away...*
Is that right, turtledove?
*Slowly back away from the barrel.*
Squeeeeeee!
*...to a razed valley below. Tendrils of Deathfog dissipate, revealing a victorious Divine Order army advancing. Humans. Magisters. Murderers.*
[VILLAIN] *Tell her no-one cares. No-one cares about anyone but themselves, and that&apos;s exactly as it should be. No-one cares about some stupid bear, and neither should they. &lt;i&gt;No-one cares!*&lt;/i&gt;
SEPTA THE INEFFABLE!
*Say that your intentions were peaceful.*
You! Son of Tenax! Has King Thoran come to liberate this isle of horrors? Braccus always feared him - he always feared dwarvish might! Oh, blessed day...!
*Tell her you&apos;re not impressed by her attitude.*
It seems the water took our boat and our luggage.
[JESTER] *Say you saw his wife. You&apos;d lean towards the Voidwoken.*
Cursed
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without dealing with Lovrik.
Persuade Brother Kalvin to admit you to the vault.
*An Automaton still and silent before you. A faint glow pulsates from within its chest cavity - dormant, perhaps.*
Monster! Monster!
What are you doing in here? Out! Now!
The ground here appears freshly dug. If you have a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;shovel&lt;/font&gt; or if you are a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Lizard&lt;/font&gt;, you can dig here to seek buried treasure.
Here, a little token for all your efforts so far. Now I had better study this tablet a while; I&apos;m sure it could teach even &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;a thing or two...
Return Justinia&apos;s letter to the dwarves.
*Tell her you&apos;ll find her.*
Come on, Sourcerer. It&apos;s always the same tale. You&apos;re boring me.
Thank you, strangeness!
Huh?! &lt;i&gt;Please!&lt;/i&gt; You have to help her!
*Ignore your own nagging guilt and consume their Source.*
We defeated the denizens of the Horrorsleep. We gave Sadha the Swornbreaker and promised to defeat the God King.
Praying at an altar, I heard a mysterious voice. Calm and benevolent, it did not reveal who it was. As it left, it imbued me with Source.
Step away from the prisoner, elf!
*Ask the elf what&apos;s going on here - the island&apos;s been overrun by the Black Ring!*
One like you, you mean? No skin off my nose. More rum for me!
I pray that moment comes.
Little did the fool know that we&apos;ve already moved everything we could get our hands on. He&apos;ll die for less than nothing.
Like you don&apos;t know. Mutiny! Did that witch fix your collar too?
I wish I had a pet like that...
Looks like it&apos;s flowing from the garden.
You don&apos;t remember, do you? You&apos;re confused. You&apos;re conflicted. And all because of this...
Barrel Close
&lt;i&gt;Sebille.&lt;/i&gt;
Hey! You&apos;re not allowed in there!
Cursed Blood Infusion Skillbook
I know - or at least, I hope - that you only want to lighten my load. But please... show some respect. If not for me, then at least for them...
We told Isla Gall about her husband&apos;s plot. She was furious.
The princess is looking so very radiant, isn&apos;t she? Yes, like an oozey meteor blazing through the blackest night!
*Lightning fast, he grabs your wrist. Shakes his head. And still he has not blinked.*
Bird Canyon 02
Get your supplies, sundries, and stuff!
Please, good lizard. Set me free...
I cannot imagine someone I would trust more with Divinity. Including myself.
Saheila joined us. We must lead her out of the sawmill.
Do not. Profane. Speak. The word. And I. Shall open.
Godsdamnit. What to do now...
The flame insists on dying! Does nothing last in this infernal land?
Dead! Sleep. Wake up? Never. Never ever. Never ever. Dead is sleep. Forever.
*She holds on to you for a long moment before stepping away, wiping her face. Eventually, she smiles.*
*Say that the God King might have use of him yet.*
I made my intentions quite clear. And you&apos;ve played your part spectacularly.
Maybe Alexandar named it. Lookin&apos; to go after what killed his Pap.
Need your hand squeezed some more? Plenty of lonely drinkers upstairs might be more amenable to that than me, champ. I only fight risk takers, those few brave enough to trust their skills to the darkness...
What a ride. I think I got smacked upside the head by one of those tentacles.
You come to the wrong place at the wrong time...
No less, either.
Healing Ritual Scroll
In you go, ma&apos;am. I&apos;ll close the gate behind you.
*You won&apos;t take threats from someone that bathes in lamp oil. Draw your weapon!*
A thief&apos;s been prowling about, I&apos;m afraid. Can I take a look at all your belongings?
*Say you&apos;d like to join the captain&apos;s crew. Where could you find him?*
*Sadly wonder whether you really did the right thing killing poor Peeper.*
So many suspects... so many potential culprits... I need to narrow down the list... think, you damn elf, think...
And what makes you think you still have the right to a name? The right to any self worth?
