I&apos;m positive I read about this in last month&apos;s &lt;i&gt;&apos;Avant-Garde Alchemist&apos;...&lt;/i&gt;
Case in point is that I have a high opinion of myself because of my unparalleled skills and intellect, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; because of the bed I was born in.
Jewellery Box
You shall not leave. Cannot. &lt;i&gt;May not&lt;/i&gt;. Not anymore.
*She notices you observing her. She straightens her back and sets her jaw in a defiant scowl.*
*The bereaved father weeps uncontrollably.*
Hell if I know. A terrible answer, but it&apos;s all I&apos;ve got. But it wasn&apos;t long after she started hovering around Justinia that things started to change. Justinia&apos;s always been... &lt;i&gt;hard, &lt;/i&gt;if you know what I mean, but...
Looks like I found our thief. Death is the only proper punishment for criminals like you!
I may have a blade or two that could use a honing...
*Explain that you do mean to apologise. You&apos;re not a selfish person.*
But I saw the lighthouse. &lt;i&gt;I saw the light. &lt;/i&gt;The lookout rang the bell, but I thought that he was wrong - I steered for port, but there was no harbour. And the bell rang on!
So I need money. For a boat, for a crew, enough to bribe someone into letting her go. I&apos;ll find a way.
*Sebille twirls her ghostly needle, looking not at you, but at the coursing waters that rock the Lady Vengeance.*
*Say Lucian isn&apos;t here to help himâ€¦ but you are.*
Not that your story is finished, of course. Your Divinity shines upon all who walk Rivellon - and there will be those that escape to the shadows. You must be ready to face them, whenever they might emerge.
So, I&apos;ll give you a discount if you can guess my riddle correctly too. How about you do that and then you can go away, yes?
This I know, because Fane is now my master. My task - to chronicle the rise and fall of the Godwoken. This was their story. Master, I hope you approve.
Fugitive? I, uh... I don&apos;t think that&apos;s something I should be discussing with strangers!
*Ifan raises an eyebrow and folds his arms, looking every inch the man you&apos;d hate to run into in a dark alley at night.*
Good things&apos;ll occur. REALLY good things! Go on, o&apos;en the chest!
*With a jolt, her life flashes before your eyes. You &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; her in her prime, battling a felled Magister in a deserted clearing. Electricity crackles from your fingers as you advance upon the Magister...*
With Lohar dead we can finally close the chapter on dwarven conspiracy in Driftwood. The Magisters are indebted to you. You have done us a great service indeed!
*He tenderly runs a hand along the coffin&apos;s side panel.*
*A rasping, ancient laugh rises from the girl&apos;s throat.*
Egads! It speaks our tongue, Quercus! Hush, before...
The arch-demon doctor is in Arx.
*Fight to contain your God and ask how it knows all of this.*
Select
*The statue reaches blindly upwards, her face tear-streaked with trickles of rainwater, and her wings pockmarked by the salty spray of the sea.*
*You&apos;re not so sure she has good intentions. Decline.*
Magister Carver is dead... if you have business here, it&apos;ll have to wait until his successor is appointed.
I refuse to entertain the possibility. Yes, the Void is stronger than ever, but so are you!
Drillworm Burrow
Right you are, right you are! Luckily, I&apos;ve learned a few lessons. And as you know, I&apos;ve a pretty good punch!
Battle-axe Woman
*Look over your arm. Scions all. All dead...*
*You hear a voice - soft and calm, yet laced with undeniable authority.*
*Say you thought he would be happy to serve Lucian once more.*
Takes more than an empty threat to convince me, honey. Off you trot!
*Roar your displeasure. You are not the monster here - the queen is. And she will be judged as one.*
Almira&apos;s dead... there&apos;s no point in me going on...
*Shake your head. No promise means no bargain.*
[BEAST] *It&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;weapon? &lt;/i&gt;Whatever Justinia means to do with it, you have your own plans. Smash it.*
Off to the arena with ya, then!
...now with Sir Gareth back to lead us, a-and if I know him, he must have found those Source weapons. We might actually have a chance at surviving this!
*You feel Tir-Cendelius lurch forward in fury, straining against your will. Release it, let it speak.*
We found a strange tablet covered in runes. When we touched it, we experienced a sensation of being in a dark, endless void. A voice called out &apos;Godwoken&apos; to us. What was that place...?
*She scowls and braces herself for a fight.*
Chop trees down. Chop heads off. Chop, chop, chop!
*The ancient temple of Zorl-Stissa crowns the cliff. &lt;i&gt;Loathsome place&lt;/i&gt;.*
Spirit of Lord Arhu
You should be proud my father picked you - his best right-hand man. He knew you would make it. But he also knew that if he told you the truth, you would falter. He knew you well, Ifan.
The Mistake fled the sewers, destination unknown.
Rot
*His dead eyes stare at you in disbelief for the briefest of moments. Then his legs give way, and he drops to the ground.*
Get out. I&apos;ve suffered enough.
A carnivorous flower rumoured to prefer the taste of human flesh above all others.
Ha! People will enslave anything these days. At least back in my day, they had the elegance to opt for an elf.
Official-looking letter
Forgive me. My armour whispers. It is... impatient.
Yes, well... That is to say... That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt;, not...
You have my thanks, for your... candour. I&apos;d like some time to myself now, if you don&apos;t mind.
Dungeon Dark 03
*Without a flicker of fear on her face, she smirks arrogantly up at you.*
Who in their right mind would keep a Voidwoken locked up like this.
Defeat the Devourer.
Defeat Lord Kemm.
The Magisters aren&apos;t the only ones looking for me. But... who is it? And why?
*Warn him you&apos;re pretty quick with a weapon too.*
*The Sourcerer holds up his hand to silence you, and you note the rope burns on his wrist from where he&apos;d been bound and hanged. He has nothing left to say.*
Oh, I think you&apos;ve had enough. I might be a prolific layer, but I&apos;m not an egg factory, you know!
What always happens.
Please, good man. Set me free...
Not fit? I have given &lt;i&gt;my life&lt;/i&gt; to the Order. I will take the sacred duty of Divinity with the seriousness it deserves. I will not take disparagement from a turncoat assassin like you!
We must hurry now! We must race toward the well with all the determination of the eagle diving for its prey.
Target receives 1 AP and [2]% damage boost at the cost of [1] Constitution.
Take Morrgen. He&apos;ll serve you well.
My protector. My friend. An elf like me, with a spirit bright as new leaves. He tries to help me, to save me, and he suffers very much.
What do you say, &lt;i&gt;rava&lt;/i&gt;?
This place sets my teeth on edge.
*You don&apos;t know what subtext is. Or you don&apos;t care. Bid the rat good day.*
Instead, you sneak around my house like a rat after invading my privacy elsewhere.
[Translate44_50dfcab8-752e-4bc4-9008-744db154aba3]
Then the next thing you know, I hear this voice - &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;voice. Telling me to kill. And my hand went for my dagger...
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without resolving the matter.
*Siwan struggles to her feet, clinging to you tightly. The ship lets out a deep groan... then CRACKS.*
I like a kin who knows what he wants and isn&apos;t afraid to take it. You&apos;re right, let&apos;s not play games. But let&apos;s take it slow. Shall I dance for you? Or would you like to hear a poem?
You&apos;re a fool if you lean on their false authority.
*The brother is at peace with himself. He stood by his queen, and he stood by his sister too. His exile and ultimate death wasn&apos;t his fault. But his sister rages on - she did the right thing, she stood up for what she believed.*
I&apos;ve no time for THAT sort of attitude, indeed!
Cryogenic Stasis Skillbook
[HERO] *Stand straight and tall. Through you she may hear Lucian&apos;s words - and you say she must depart.*
An odd, crystalline (and, apparently, sentient) object pulsating with eldritch energy.
*Say you&apos;re glad they found each other again. Even under these circumstances.*
...I am perfectly in control, Quercus. Those claw marks were probably on your spine already.
Magical Leather Trousers
*BARK!*
I&apos;m glad to see you, too. But... Henric...
*The nurse steals a glance at you, chewing his lower lip hungrily with blackened teeth.*
[MYSTIC] *Tell her you can feel her pain.*
Selling Wares
Hurry, eh? My number could be up any minute.
Tentacle Lash Skillbook
*He thinks on this.*
These humans slaughter each other within their own stone forests. How did such savages ever rise to power to begin with...?
You&apos;ll probably find it quite comfortable.
Oh, wow! You&apos;re like a skeleton, but you can talk? I never heard of anyone like that before!
*Ask what the Empress did to the fanatic.*
*Bow your head and take your leave.*
Cur! Even now you would stab me in the back once more? You would deny me &lt;i&gt;my own children?&lt;/i&gt;
*The girl&apos;s black gaze recedes for a moment, revealing her own eyes, wide and pleading. She extends a hand towards you...*

I&apos;ve had better days out in this city.
Creates a small blessed water surface with a [1] radius.
I need you to &lt;i&gt;take care&lt;/i&gt; of my father-in-law... and bring me his will.
Shall Lord Kemm be joining us, my lady?
You know about that, do yeh? Well before you go blood-crazed, you should know the queen&apos;s no friend of mine. Not no more.
Yes... You remember, don&apos;t you? My weapons, my magic, my master scheme &lt;b&gt;FOR DIVINITY!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Potent Alertness Herbmix
[LOHSE] *Consider your companions. Nice folks, but they&apos;re probably better off without you.*
The final voyage of the Lady Vengeance. She served us well.
You made it out of Fort Joy; you&apos;ve been rubbin&apos; shoulders with Magisters and lived to tell the tell. Hell, you&apos;ve even survived me so far. I reckon you&apos;re our best bet.
*Geraldine listens with bated breath. Mabel pretends not to care.*
*Put the poor wretch out of his misery.*
I&apos;ll be fine. Let&apos;s go. We&apos;ll make short work of him.
[SCHOLAR] *Explain that you&apos;re a seeker of knowledge, but you fear where that pursuit has led you.*
*Sigh!* Oh, to be a dwarf. They have all the juiciest drama! And the best fur, too.
*Curling her torn lip back over broken teeth, she grabs your hand and pulls you down to the ale-soaked table. Never losing eye contact, she begins arm-wrestling you.*
Yes - the Mad Sourcerer tainted both his time and ours. His stench is not easily rinsed away. But it seems to me that Voidwoken and Shriekers were a more present danger, yes?
*Rolling his eyes at the Magister&apos;s warning, the man named Ifan beckons again.*
Still, she&apos;ll drown with the rest of these fools. And I will simply pluck my mask from her cold, dead hands.
Investigation Over
The Lady Vengeance waits offshore, ready to sail for a righteous cause. Find a Purging Wand. Alexandar... Alexandar&apos;s Shriekers will &lt;i&gt;rot.&lt;/i&gt;

*Ask him about what happened at the consulate.*
