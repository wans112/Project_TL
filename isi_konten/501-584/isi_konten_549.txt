Magister Virgil - 215lb, good marbling&lt;br&gt;Magister Harrick - 162lb, too lean&lt;br&gt;Magister Brant - 188lb, diseased liver&lt;br&gt;Magister Stanley - 179lb, tough meat (marinate?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next -&lt;br&gt;Magister Caryl&lt;br&gt;Magister Fedor &lt;br&gt;Magister Carver
*The spirit watches you, composed and dignified, even in death.*
And it&apos;s... it&apos;s showing me things...
*Sigh* I thought you were supposed to be &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;. If I&apos;d expected such a &lt;i&gt;sour &lt;/i&gt;attitude, I might have chosen my host differently.
There you are, Lohse girl...
*Smile. Tilt your head. Raise your eyebrows. Wait for him to melt.*
Well, if it isn&apos;t my &apos;killer&apos;. I didn&apos;t expect you to make it this far, Sourcerer.
*Say she&apos;s right. It wasn&apos;t her fault. You know that.*
Within these pages, Dallis describes a mysterious entity who understands power in the same way she does.
*Note that this is a dangerous task - perhaps he could spare a few Seekers to help you...*
Well, stay alert. Anyone could be guilty.
But such dark magic was wrought upon Bloodmoon Island that its inmost self must have been there in its true guise. Exposed, so that it could wreak ultimate havoc.
One moment, my flesh was flaming with cursed fire. The next, a stranger came along and eased my pain!
Right. Well. I&apos;m a host. Always have been, probably always will be. I&apos;m never alone in my head. Spirits visit, wanderers, sprites, demons, ghouls, disembodied mystics...
*He grabs the young elf by the jaw and squeezes.*
*Psst.* Hey. Up here. You&apos;re a little light in yer pack, ain&apos;t ya bud? Who could blame you with the garbage they&apos;ve got fer sale around here.
An intruder! Remove yourself from my royal court at once!
Queen Justinia&apos;s dwarven subjects intercepted a major Divine Order shipment.
I came looking for weapons. Powerful ones. Wicked ones, may Lucian forgive me. Weapons that will clear a path to Dallis&apos; flagship.
I... I really should. Do you... do you think you could look after the cart? I can get myself back to the Fort fine. After all these expeditions, I know the way well enough.
Ah, so very nice to see you again. Hope you&apos;re enjoying this gorgeous weather! You look like you &lt;i&gt;deserve &lt;/i&gt;it.
Voidwoken, walking dead, Seekers - and still the worst thing about this swamp is the stink. Blessed be...
Big deal. A &lt;i&gt;wet rag&lt;/i&gt; could be champion of those pathetic saps. What kind of champion could be captured by Magisters?
Operation Downfall, ya numbskull. And you&apos;ll tell me what you know, or I&apos;ll turn your guts inside out &apos;n&apos; stuff &apos;em down your throat.
Etched with the esoteric symbolism of the Black Ring on the inside, and marked by Divine Order arrows on the outside, this is a shield from the Great War.
Evidently.
My Memoirs
Perhaps, but we cannot take that risk. If we let him slip away without following every lead, then his next victim is on our heads.
Just the right kind of surface for you to craft on. If, that is, you have anything to craft...
*You&apos;re a loner. Say this all quite new to you as well.*
*Allow the search.*
Captain Trippel&apos;s Key
Is that... oh Void, it IS a Shrieker!
*The moment you finger the silky flower, icy darkness pierces your heart. The chill freezes your bones, then rushes free, leaving a single word etched within you: &lt;i&gt;Godwoken.*&lt;/i&gt;
*The brute rams his fist against his own helmeted skull until he is silent, then gestures further inland once again.*
Paladins! Take them!
*The shaggy dog keeps his distance, wary eyes sizing you up as his hackles rise.*
*Tell the rat you&apos;ve never heard anything so ludicrous in your life.*
*Look around and realise you&apos;ve been here before.*
*Smile and say you&apos;re happy to help.*
[1] Memory Slot(s)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I do not need you to linger. I need you to go out there. To give an evil man what he deserves.
Speaking of which, do you not have lifeboats to fight over?
*Tell her you&apos;re an elf and you can do without the widdle, thank you.*
I have spent too long alone - and now loneliness is the most I can look forward to. Thanks to you, Fane.
You do not disappoint, my prince. You&apos;re every bit the gentleman they said you&apos;d be.
*Say that you&apos;d like to speak with Arhu.*
*The hound sees you reach for your weapon and growls, baring sharp, white teeth.*
Look out! I see a trap nearby...
*She turns away. Conversation over.*
Herring
You will not be spared. Your time is up.
Initiative: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
*Before you know it, the crossbow and arrow are tucked away in Ifan&apos;s backpack, and the conversation ends with a curt nod on both sides.*
*Tell him you&apos;re not interested in any matter your friends can&apos;t hear.*
A whetstone wheel. Now what do I have that needs sharpening...
I am a Scion, and you speak with respect or -
*Her eyes narrow like a cat&apos;s, as she reaches out and places one delicate hand on your arm.*
Autumn, the turbulent beauty. It brings colour to our home, and death to our enemies. Tir-Cendelius utters his battle cry, and rains down spears of pure light.
Cave - Drawbridge (Up)
*Say you&apos;ve seen the horrors of Braccus&apos; reign with your own eyes. You wouldn&apos;t wish them on anyone.*
So, before we hit the road? It&apos;s best if we decide battle strategies up front. Should keep more of &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; blood in.
Electric Infusion
What I have to say is of great importance.
A Danger to Herself and Others
*She hushes you with an index finger held to your lips, and continues her search.*
And given that this ship is sinking, I expect my time is rather limited.
Go away, Dallis, or I&apos;ll Sourcery you!
So endeth the lesson, Godwoken. I hope you fare well on your path.
Change your party&apos;s formation by clicking above the topmost player portrait.
It can be hard to sleep sometimes. I get flashes of... &lt;i&gt;before.&lt;/i&gt;
*Take your leave.*
*She knows Raedalus went to see the Chancellor in his chambers. She did not know that Lucian was already there. She weeps.*
The hero of heroes wants to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt;, does she? Well, think away. If you can&apos;t give me your fresh blood, there are... other sources.
My answer was &apos;no&apos;, and &apos;no&apos; it remains.
Teleportation Scroll
*As you turn away, some markings on a nearby barrel catches your eye. Walk over to investigate.*
And? What news?
The &lt;i&gt;masked priestess&lt;/i&gt;, Gratiana. She gave us shelter here, and told Sir Gareth how to stop the Shriekers... but she unnerves me. Speak to her if you w-wish - she may know more.
You think I wanted this to happen?! You think I love having a bloody murderer in my head?
True. And I certainly won&apos;t get the truth from you this way. There&apos;s a much easier method, after all.
More bounty hunters on my trail. Good luck to them!
*Ask what she thinks about Meistr Siva.*
*Hold back your tears. Beast was a friend. He deserved a better end than this.*
*Squeeze harder.*
Money doesn&apos;t always talk, fool. It certainly won&apos;t help you in your prison cell!
The Void is strong here. Even the stone is infected...
*Refuse him still: you kneel before no-one.*
*He turns towards you. Then he breathes deeply through his nose, his tongue extended, as if he were tasting the air.*
All the threads lead back to Alexandar. The erstwhile Bishop has questions to answer.
Give Ryker the tablet.
*Ask what exactly he wants you to do.*
*Tell him you&apos;re here for the elf Saheila.*
I do... and plainly you do not. Godwoken you might be, but you are not worthy of becoming Divine. Every word you speak betrays the fact.
*Roll your eyes and take a guess. He wants you to get him some drudanae.*
Suffice to say I need to speak with a certain lizard. So let&apos;s find him.
On the bottle is written &apos;Cathalin Hunter Lazarev&apos;. But what does the potion do, one wonders?
You deny your Mother, Sebille Kaleran. You betray your kin. You deserve what comes to you. Talk to me no more.
I reached a new level of mastery over my Source powers, thanks to Hannag the Portalmaster. I grow ever closer to fulfilling my destiny.
Can&apos;t trust anyone. Especially the likes of you. And especially with what&apos;s been going on.
*Ask how she knows about that.*
The poems in this book would make even the lustiest of dwarves blush.
But... But it is you, isn&apos;t it? The Red Prince... My word, it is imperative that we talk, Your Majesty!
Gratiana may know where to find Purging Wands.
Shadow Dragon
Too late! You spilled the beans... I&apos;ve been told about your party tricks. Every Lone Wolf in the land is looking to sink its teeth into your flesh!
*A voice rises around you, its source unclear. Fractured whispers surround you.*
But more than the contract, I&apos;ve got questions. About what really happened during the war. And I&apos;m not going to let him die until he answers them.
I told them all... nothing. What makes you think I shall not hold firm against you too, hmm?
*Laugh at your little joke, then lean forward for her to kiss you.*
The leaf that enlightens. Drudanae.
*His howl rents the air as he thrashes violently, resisting oblivion to the very... last... moment.*
Very good, sir.
&lt;i&gt;Your head.&lt;/i&gt;
That&apos;s one word for it, I guess. I met Jahan, and he tried the exorcism. But... it didn&apos;t work. The demon&apos;s still... knocking around in there. In here.
Metalwork
*Ask what you need to do.*
*He pulls a pair of shackles out of his bag and holds them out, open, toward you.*
*Ryker&apos;s lips stretch and his cheeks bulge - but you couldn&apos;t rightly call his unusual grimace a smile.*
SURFACE PAINTER
Huh. Is that all I can be now...
...now I have to make sure that you stay silent...
Move Portrait Up
*Tell her she was about as nimble as a wollock in a tutu.*
*Walk away without saying a word.*
You look like a good sort. Couldja scratch &apos;y nose?
So if I am to traverse this land, I will need a mask to disguise my features.
*You feel a sudden, irresistible urge to dig into your eyes with your own hands.*
It&apos;ll be a &apos;last&apos; as well...
I&apos;m no leader... we&apos;re all g-going to die here.
Flay Skin Skillbook
But if he&apos;s Godwoken like us? Maybe, for now... just maybe, it&apos;s good fortune that he&apos;s still breathing.
*The Magister immediately approaches your cell and reaches for his keys...*
Looks like I found our killer, huh? You&apos;re in for it now!
*She moves her body slowly, slowly, slowly over yours until you are one person, the surprise of it, the perfection of it making you both gasp.*
*Trace the jagged heart line. Tell her that relationships don&apos;t come easy to her.*
*She turns away.*
Yes, you know me from within - from a memory of a memory of a memory...
*Peruse the merchant&apos;s inventory.*
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her that you find her research fascinating.*
Merchant&apos;s Last Will &amp; Testament
*Say it doesn&apos;t matter.*
*She grabs her brusquely; forces her face close to Sebille&apos;s.*
And &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;presume to stop me?!
Go now, Red Prince. Rivellon and its Masters await.
One of our number, a doctor, brought an invalid before us; an elven maiden who had become infested with some... &lt;i&gt;presence&lt;/i&gt;.
So. You wanna check this place out together? Strength in numbers and all that.
The honour is all mine. I pray we will not need to call on you, but I am grateful for the offer.
*Attempt to pull the lever.*
Magic Mirror
With their queen dead and a dwarven Divine, the dwarves led the Alliance in the battle against the God King. Dwarves became the most advanced of the races.
We can&apos;t move forward while those Shriekers are there. You have to find a way to purge them. &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;.
