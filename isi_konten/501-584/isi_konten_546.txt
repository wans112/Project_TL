My dear Hardwin, or if I may, my dear Thom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say it is better to ask forgiveness than ask permission, which is why I put my pen to paper this morning, with heavy heart. I have been a loyal servant and true to the Paladins of the Order and to you, my leader, to the honour of myself and my family too, for these last long years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now I must depart. You may believe that I am deserting my post from fear or fatigue or perfidy, but you must not. I cannot divulge where I will go, but know that I leave in service of a higher power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thom, please carry this message to my family in Arx that they may know I did not shame them, even as the rumours fly and gossips whisper in the street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope to see you, and them, again once more, in better times, when all that I have done is clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you understand, and if you cannot, I hope at least that you forgive me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until we meet again, I am yours sincerely,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dyn Fortimere
Roamers
We encountered a sentient Voidwoken. It claimed that it was once an Eternal - the extinct race from which the Seven Gods supposedly originated.
Now: Show me what you learned from that &lt;i&gt;other &lt;/i&gt;soul-stealing miscreant who&apos;s taken an interest in you.
*She puffs upon the pipe and blows the smoke towards you. When it clears she&apos;s looking away again, as if you were never there.*
Luuuucky in life. Unluuuucky in love.
Statue
*Attend to your queen. Is she hurt?*
[JESTER] *Say you&apos;re glad she likes to joke around. Has she heard the one about the dancing sheep?*
This large potion, a beautiful, swirling concoction smelling faintly of coconuts, grants resistance to water damage.
Identify the killer.
Undead! I strike in Lucian&apos;s name, creature!
Best of luck, Sebille.
[IFAN] *Tell him Deathfog is an abomination. And rather than poisoning the tree, you intend to kill &lt;i&gt;him.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him you&apos;re his worst nightmare. Then kill him. Kill them all.*
Yastara is the one you want then. Hardly anyone&apos;s walked away from an encounter with her blade.
Orders on a dead Magister spoke of &apos;Seekers&apos; - dissidents, hiding in the south-east of the island. We should find them.
You cannot use more than 5 digits.
I think we&apos;re done, don&apos;t you?
*Say that you feel chilled to the bone... but don&apos;t mention what you saw... &lt;i&gt;the visions&lt;/i&gt;...*
Search for Lagan&apos;s ring.
*Note that the shop seems heavily guarded. Ask if he has a problem with thieves.*
Civil Abilities
*Grief flows through you, as if a deep sadness has replaced all the blood in your veins.*
*A warmth cocoons you; infusing your every muscle with the will to relax. A soft voice surrounds you and whispers, &lt;i&gt;&apos;You deserve better.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Our master is grateful for your help. Search Kemm&apos;s garden and find his vault.&lt;/i&gt;
Sssssh... don&apos;t fight it. This is how it&apos;s supposed to be. Sleep now. When you wake, it will be in a new world. A beautiful world.
[LOHSE] *Hail the Magisters with their own holy prayer.*
Harvestman
Erratic Entity
An exquisite idea! I swear, my good sense must be rubbing off on you.
*Prod an eviscerated carp with your boot and say that he&apos;s wasting his time - no-one&apos;s going to buy rotten fish.*
Blue Ring
Curved Blade
*Say he sounds familiar, but you can&apos;t be sure.*
We met the spirit of a druid - an elven pilgrim who came here to help the stricken Ancestor Tree.
HA! Haha!
Prisoner&apos;s Boots
Have you seen the contraptions this mortal has crafted? He may have the very tool I need to craft my mask!
*Tell the cat her owner is seduced by her cat&apos;s gorgeousness. But seduction is not love. Her owner may one day be seduced anew by a yet-more-gorgeous creature.*
*Wave your hand through the wafting smoke and ask if that&apos;s drudanae you&apos;re smelling.*
Are you ready to go? It&apos;s... it&apos;s time.
[BARBARIAN] *Offer to find the culprits. You&apos;ll have their heads!*
Spirit of a Black Ring Reaver
*Ask him what he&apos;s doing.*
*Her smile fades.*
A well-made, chequered hankie with only the faintest trace of its previous owner&apos;s leavings.
Egg, egg, egg. Baby egg.
Paladin General
*He reaches out and tentatively pokes a bit of  your tender flesh.*
Hold it! There is an attack in the area. And I can tell you know something about it.
Picture it. Sneakin&apos; out o&apos; your quarters under light of moon to go skinny dippin&apos; in Claw Lake. You&apos;d bring turkey legs &apos;n&apos; ale, and we&apos;d drink &apos;til the stars swirled. Only twelve years of age, we were, but your beard was already as long as your forearm!
Well hello there, Mister... what was your name again? I&apos;m Lohse.
Good, then. But be on the lookout. A vandal is on the loose.
I&apos;m not here &apos;cause I wanna be. The Thieves&apos; Guild kicked me out, all &apos;cause I took some stupid plate from the stash. I&apos;s just tryin&apos; to show &apos;em I could, I swear. I&apos;m better&apos;n all of &apos;em put together!
Make two characters switch places. One of the characters can be you.
I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; speak with this spirit. Stay close - danger may yet lurk in the shadows.
I say this to prepare you for the worst. I say this to prepare you for the kill may come to pass. You must be ready to be the death of Lohse.
*Beads of sweat stain your forehead. You realise what happened, and you&apos;re sorry.*
And not the good kind.
I&apos;m not supposed to talk to strangers.
*Note Dallis&apos; impatience. What was she looking for?*
A wise attitude. &lt;i&gt;Most &lt;/i&gt;wise. I&apos;m sure we can build something magnificent on these foundations.
[SOLDIER] *Say the campfire soot and camaraderie shared.*
*Feeling mightily betrayed, grimly state the true villain here is she.*
&apos;It just happened&apos; that you destroy mine.
Like the poem? Sure makes yer empire sound pretty good, eh?
Ambient
a new world where the elves could start again.
Edit Skillset
I&apos;ll do as I please - this Paladin filth hacked me down right here in our headquarters. She&apos;s going to suffer for what she did to me...
What have we done...
*Same as before, the spirit remains locked in a shocked trance.*
I can&apos;t tell whether she&apos;s welcoming me or warding me away.
*You feel a strange obligation to obey. Kneel before the elf.*
Itself
A sturdy pair of blacksmith&apos;s pincers.
Kerban
*A low, resonant vibration hums somewhere deep within you.*
We crafted our homes from stone and crystal, using the power of the universe itself to keep them in place.
Look, &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; Griff&apos;s right hand, and &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; going to find that crate. And &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re&lt;/i&gt; gonna watch me hand it over to him.
You&apos;ve been making a bit of trouble, I hear. Come on, then. Off to prison with you.
You won&apos;t be so fast to judge me after you&apos;ve rotted in this place a while longer...
You have quite the gall. My patience is at an end!
Both Queen Justinia and Isbeil are dead.
We were picked off by spies! There was no glory and no point to it either!
Add points to skill abilities to add starting skills to this page.
A damn dastardly way to die. Braccus was a tyrant of the highest order.
Decide what to do with Higba.
Doesn&apos;t bother you one bit, indeed. To see a &lt;i&gt;sir&lt;/i&gt; cut down by a &lt;i&gt;slave&lt;/i&gt;. A &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; by a &lt;i&gt;plod!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say that you can easily distinguish between right and wrong. They are clearly different concepts.*
Oh and as for the riddle... greater than the Gods, more evil than the Void. The poor have it, the rich need it, and if you eat it, you will die... the answer of course, is &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;It&apos;s time to act on the stage the Order has built for you. Dallis and I write the lines. Your role is only to perform them as scripted. I trust you understand.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; Alexandar turns his back; his cape sways mesmerisingly as he marches away.*
*Smile at the child and say hello.*
*Blink. Wedding?*
Be warned, though. A crucified horror, a Shrieker, waits outside. Do not venture too near it.
From Flanking: [1]%
*Tell him you&apos;ll leave him be... if the girl goes with you.*
...Very well, then. But as you lack the glowing eyes of the Divine, I assume you have still been found lacking. If not in character, then certainly in Source.
*Tell him to give you the location; you&apos;ll see what you can do.*
Well, for all intents and purposes, you are clean.
*Take the rapier. Note the bend near the point of the blade. Raise the sword, and bring it down, flat and hard, on the edge of the table.*
*Ask what compelled the gods to give up fully half of their powers.*
&lt;i&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&lt;/i&gt;
Good detail on this thing. But it&apos;s not dwarven work.
Ah-ah, dearest prince. Handsome devil though you may be, I am a proper lady, you know! Glorious nuptials first, dear prince, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt;... you&apos;re mine for good.
Around here, vandals get put in their rightful place: Prison!
Not if I have anything to do with it.
Absent-minded Professor
The Burning Pigs
What happened? I followed orders, that&apos;s what. Magister Reimond decreed that no White Magister should fall into captivity - no matter what. Better a quick poison than a sloppy thrust from a Paladin blade anyway.
*Force yourself back into reality. You haven&apos;t the time for strange visitations.*
I&apos;ve no words to waste on you. Off you trot.
*Birdie starts to cry. He lets you hold him for a moment, his whole weight pressed into yours, then slowly stands up, licks your cheek, and walks away.*
*It falls to its knees and grabs its matted hair in two fists, then &lt;i&gt;rips&lt;/i&gt;. The spectral mats break away and reappear.*
Indeed. I must ask why.
*Ask where he heard the truth about your leaving behind the others on the ship.*
*Tell him &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;should be paying &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Make to walk away.*
Blinding Squall
*Tell him he&apos;s quite clever. He changed his will so that the groom could never touch his money!*
Sunny 01
Yeah, but I&apos;m so &lt;i&gt;comfortable. &lt;/i&gt;See?
You there! Help me, please!
*Spits.*
I want your sight.
By the by, do please remember the warning I gave you in the woods: should Lohse come close to divine ascension, you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; act; you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; kill her.
Some sort of Divine Order experiment gone bad, I suppose...
Thank you. And thank you for not mentioning... you know...
Each link whispers like a sovereign soul, and perhaps they are?
Loyalty of the Divine
*Say you&apos;ll pray for her health. Given the shade of her eyes, she looks rather ill.*
Well, we&apos;d better get a move on. I&apos;ve got a demonologist to find!
Blunt Morningstar
Is it failure when a guard punches you in the face for being a twit? But you&apos;re right, I suppose. Could be worse.
*Roll your eyes at these weaklings and draw your weapon. This should be easy.*
I have no grand library to offer, but there is food and shelter. Please, stay here as long as you wish.
Oh, but they call us by so many different names, don&apos;t they? First Sourcerer, then Godwoken... all the while dangling another one in front of us: &lt;i&gt;Divine.&lt;/i&gt;
Her treachery was vile, but she shouldn&apos;t be left lying on the cobbles. I pray she&apos;s interred quickly.
*Kneel in front of the child and say hello.*
Hm. Rather... disappointing, isn&apos;t it. This must be a bad batch. I&apos;ve heard such interesting things about the kitchen here.
You witness this and weep? Die here if you wish - my work is not done.
[SOLDIER] *Scowl. This doesn&apos;t look like justice. It looks like petty retribution.*
Poisoned Arrowhead
Magister Tatcher
Lord Kemm&apos;s in no mood for suffering fools - we had better find some sign of the Whites soon...
