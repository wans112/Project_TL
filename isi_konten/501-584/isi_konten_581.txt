*He waves a hand at you in disgust, turning away.*
You think that trick would work on me? You&apos;re under arrest.
You showed me how beautiful it really was. There is no-one else I would trust to make this choice. Whatever you decide, I will follow.
Magisters and Paladins, all dead.
Good gods. I mean... you know what I mean.
Right. Ok.
*About the Seekers...*
[The manuscript is written in a code you cannot decipher, but for a few lines written in the common tongue.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for Sebille, I appreciate the warning, but stand down. She is now a threat only unto herself. The Mother Tree will choke on Deathfog and with that all will be well. If the girl is silly enough to pursue an actual confrontation, she deserves the enslavement I would now spare her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, do keep me posted on the Red Prince. My word, what an annoyingly talented nuisance that arrogant little brat turns out to be!
Indeed. I - we - will never know the comfort of the Hall of Echoes. This is our penance and the Seekers&apos; burden.
*Hold up your hands and apologise. You meant no disrespect.*
*Dismiss her with a wave of your hand. That&apos;s what you get for rejecting knowledge. It&apos;s almost &lt;i&gt;entirely &lt;/i&gt;her fault, if you think about it...*
The Djinn is free, and left us its lamp.
Recover the remaining pieces of the pirate captain&apos;s set of enchanted armour.
I brought you up from girl to woman, Marla. Like you was my own. This...
*So he&apos;s a bard, then. Ask how he&apos;s in such a good mood in such troubled times.*
Hmm?
Disconnected User
Should you take my soul, I will seal the other spirits away. You shall never meet the Devourer as he wishes.
Is that right, turtledove?
The most delicious-looking Dwarven wedding cake you&apos;ve ever seen. Which isn&apos;t saying much.
They have come to stop the ascension.
[BEAST] *Those shining eyes. You can&apos;t help it. You&apos;re sold.*
Found it in the scrap heap not so long ago. We used to know each other back in the day, you know. Dallis and I.
*Curl a hand into a fist and menacingly raise it in front of your face.*
First a taste, a morsel, then the meal...
*Reassure her that it was lovely talking to her, but you have to attend to something else.*
*The fish instantly churns your insides... everything turns black...*
This elixir temporarily coats you in an invisibility spell. The large bottle appears to be empty, but...
*The sister smiles - she feels vindicated. Her brother still does not agree. The rebellion was a disaster. The rebellion was a mistake - that cost them their lives.*
*Your mind is empty as a new moon. Something seems to have cleared it out, scrubbed the corners, bleached the halls. The nothingness is oddly comfortable.*
Use it well! And my thanks to you, good knight. May our paths cross again soon!
*Shake your head. You didn&apos;t know, but you&apos;re glad you asked.*
No, I made a choice. And I shall live with that choice until the end of days.
Leya
Explode, dealing [1] in a large area around you, creating a Cursed Blood surface.
Flee the crumbling ruins.
*Say she should find a way to control that thing. It seems unpredictable.*
*Leave the device alone.*
You come find me if you change your mind.
Apple Pie
*The Magister is bound by her wrists. Judging by her wounds, she put up a fight. And lost.*
Faked his own death. Didn&apos;t take long for fate to catch up, though...
Firestorm Grenade
*Ask what she did to learn where you needed to go - and why she didn&apos;t do it earlier.*
I&apos;d better go tend to her. But if you&apos;re ever in need of healing or potions in the future, I&apos;m at your service. It&apos;s the least I could do.
Escape on Alexandar&apos;s ship.
Two-Handed Wooden Axe
Tomato
*The elf uses her palms to wipe away two steady streams of tears.*
Spirit of a Black Ring Portalmaster
A dream of death... No more...
Lobby Chat
*Jerk your arm away and furiously demand he answer for that assault.*
*The guard gives you a meek grin. You nod in return.*
*Tell him you&apos;re Black Ring.*
Pearst... he was an old friend. He encouraged me to join the Magisters... and I talked him into coming to this island. This wouldn&apos;t have happened if it wasn&apos;t for me...
[BEAST] *Advise she avoid any entanglements. Best to keep focused on her goals - whatever those may be.*
*Who knows what lies ahead for you - for your companions? Your quest failed. The Void is growing stronger and the hall is dark. You feel the need for some affection. Perhaps they feel it too?*
No-one important escapes a prison without help, and no-one frees Sourcerers bar the Seekers. They thought you were worth saving, and thus I surmise you are Godwoken.
ALLY TURN
Sure is damp and dank here. Wait. Don&apos;t those mean the same thing?
[MYSTIC] *You feel the same dark presence as before. Focus your mind and drive it away.*
Read the book on Dwarven customs.
Living on the Edge Skillbook
*Before you stands an ancient shrine, runes carved deep into its rock.*
Noxious atmosphere enabled!
We found the other half of Anathema.
*Tell him his apprentice is dead.*
*He moves closer, so close your nose is filled with his intoxicating animal scent. He catches your wrist in one rough hand. As his skin brushes yours, Source sparks between you.*
Sorry friend, I&apos;m as powerless here as you are. I&apos;ve not got her power: best I can do is hum a tune and try to keep her still.
Split Item
*Tell him any Lone Wolf who crosses your path has a whole heap of explaining to do. And that includes &lt;i&gt;him.*&lt;/i&gt;
How could I have? She never spoke of dragons!
*As the boat rocks downward, an old sea shanty passes through your mind: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Should I soon lie at bottom of sea, wouldst Duna carve out a marker for me?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Unknown
Come. On. Did they hit you too hard in the Joy or something? There&apos;s no such thing as ghosts.
Elf Civilian
Grateful? Perhaps. Perhaps.
Enforced Pants
Alas, I am no longer who I once was, bound to you as I&apos;ve become. I will teach you what I can, but the links that will expand the bounds of your soul? Those are connections I cannot make for you.
Block Summon
I&apos;m not quite sure the weather will save &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.
Talk about a fate worse than death. There&apos;s no excuse for what those priests did.
Add scrolls
&apos;tis a misfortune, brother. *Hack!* You lot can&apos;t help your condition, but at least the humans of ya ain&apos;t celebratin&apos; the Source plague!
*Tight coils wrap Tir-Cendelius from head to foot; his still face is set to a glowering sneer.*
I hope my mother doesn&apos;t hear about this.
*Tell her it was like this when you got here. You&apos;re as shocked as she is - all you want is to talk to Lord Arhu.*
*Agree to help. You could help clear a path for them.*
Spiked Trap
Such claims demand proof. How read your missive?
*Tears stream from her eyes as she offers you the flask.*
Aye. If any of that Deathfog gets in your lungs, you&apos;re done for.
Warfare skills are skills for warriors. High strength improves some of these skills. Read this book to learn this skill.
*Say that if he doesn&apos;t like it, perhaps he should help her.*
Detailed Ring
There was too much burden for one person to bear there - or an entire party. All those souls in need of resolution...
Pile of Ash
Exactly. &lt;i&gt;Exactly&lt;/i&gt;.
Why not help each other get out of here?
The silent type, are you? Very well, you can take your secrets to your grave. It&apos;ll be just to your right...
*Swann approaches. cradling his arm with a grimace of pain.*
You&apos;re not trying to escape, are you?
A chunky slab of bloody meat.
The King calls you home, unliving one. Swear to him, or the Void swallows you.
I have more looking to do, then!
*Giggle.* Arx.  The barrels are rolling all the way to Arx...
Deathfog Barrel
The Beast o&apos; the Sea is skipperin&apos; his beloved ship, the Wavedancer, headin&apos; to Reaper&apos;s Coast. His target&apos;s there, ya see. A notorious criminal kingpin called Lohar.
*Though standing, the lizard is in a deep sleep.*
I really should go back and get them.
Civilian Ledger
Mate, I&apos;m a cow. What makes you think I have anything to offer?
Stop, vandal! Help! Help!
*This box hops and dances as if an energetic toad lives within it. A large key protrudes from the side.*
Sharp Claw
Vulnerable as it was to the machinations of the demons who infiltrated the Houses, the Ancient Empire of lizards was soon brought to its knees.
Now! *Ahem* Shall we move on to more civilised topics?
*Distract him from your eyes by admiring his fancy ribbons.*
Close your eyes and listen...
Trained in order, obedience and warfare, you know the difference between a latrine and a lieutenant.
Are you? Well. I&apos;ve got bad news for you, then. There&apos;s been a tragedy. You better be on your way. We&apos;ve... we&apos;ve had enough trouble for one day.
Kraken on a crisp, get up, get up! Just &apos;cause I&apos;m a Divine don&apos;t mean you go all prostrate &apos;n&apos; stuff!
Don&apos;t judge me, sunscale, and I won&apos;t judge you.
Decomposing Aeromancer
Iron Helmet
&lt;i&gt;*Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.&lt;/i&gt; Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
[1] can&apos;t be repaired
[OUTLAW] *Wonder if she can also mix herbs that have... more negative consequences.*
Toggle inventory
Ah, you.
You&apos;re a terrible liar, you know. You&apos;ll get no reward from me. If you&apos;re trying to protect the kingdom: don&apos;t. I must send word. Quickly.
*He gazes around admiringly at the decrepit surroundings in which you find yourselves.*
Illustration
Thundering Blows
*Admit that she&apos;s right.*
Fire 15 arrows in a [1] degree arc. Each arrow deals [2].
*The canine spirit lifts his head to howl, but can barely manage a whimper. He tucks his tail between his legs, shocked at his own impotence.*
Poisoned Honey Jar
My sweet son...
I sniff-sniff... Source. Bite? Bite! Master, quick, bite! Source!
I&apos;m not quite myself after that little excursion. Would that Malady were still with us; she&apos;d probably know some fantastical chant that could heal my tattered soul.
Too much death. Too much loss. Bacaw...
The Surrey tomb must be somewhere nearby. And whatever that object is in there, I bet it&apos;s... impressive.
Hmm. I do not argue with such a sum. Go on your way, and make no more trouble.
Well? Have you found the cause of this aura, this &lt;i&gt;shroud?&lt;/i&gt;
Harridan&apos;s Clasp
Egg
*Grin broadly. You&apos;ll do what&apos;s right.*
Because you need all the help you can get. Because you want to be Divine.
The - the Void? It&apos;s breached the Veil? But that means...
Helper_Stub_Box
Still here, eh? Thought you&apos;d have better places to be.
Knew you had it in you. A good weapon&apos;s one thing, but there&apos;s nothing on Rivellon like a good companion.
Bloated Corpse
To Driftwood, then.
Air attack [T]
But... these are terribly trying times for us all, aren&apos;t they. &lt;i&gt;Very &lt;/i&gt;trying times for some of us.
The Seekers were healed.
I was resigned to my fate until you healed me... nothing but false hope. You should have left me the way you found me.
Payment in advance. Wouldn&apos;t want to have to ask you to cough up when we get to the other side... ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Thick Skin
*She laughs; her cat eyes dance with mirth.*
*She readies a retort... but then peers at you. She chews the idea over. Realises it would explain a few things. Then she dismisses it out of hand.*
