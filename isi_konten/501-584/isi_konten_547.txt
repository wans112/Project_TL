I know, I know. The wolf&apos;s getting soft in his middle age...
Seems like a lifetime ago that I spied you in the Joy.
Dwarven Royal Shield
*The hollows of the Devourer&apos;s eyes glow. It&apos;s a starving, scouring light, pulling you in and refusing to let go.*
*Scratching the pole does wonders for your nails.*
*Say you&apos;ll return another time.*
If I ever go to Arx I&apos;m staying away from this black house.
The God King hears my call!
Hmm? Oh. Yes. Only a week or two before - well - you know. I wanted to serve him more than anything.
*You try to fight, try to reclaim what&apos;s yours, but a woman takes you by the hand and leads you to a tower.*
A prince is always prey: the target of ambitions, jealousies and foreign spies. Same old nuisance, though slightly more bothersome without a palace guard at your beck and call.
Yes, I am the Devourer, whose power has survived death itself. My power will be yours, when the armour is complete.

Demons nervous? &lt;i&gt;Of what?!&lt;/i&gt;
Zorl-Stissa, God of Lizards
Horrific Scream
*Tell her you&apos;ve been to the vault and recovered the wand.*
He&apos;s a pawn of Dallis - we can&apos;t just leave him here to do as he pleases.
*Say you&apos;ve come to pray to the Seven at the altar he&apos;s guarding.*
Deathfog. Nasty stuff. Overkill for a bunch of scattered rebels, though. Justinia&apos;s stoopin&apos; lower than even &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;thought possible.
My my, you&apos;ve been more industrious than I had given you credit for, Godwoken.
Ferocity
We do not linger, we ARE the island, we ARE the B...
Gwydian thanked us, then left the Blackpits for good.
Magister Caryl
Black Ring Witherknight
*Say that sounds like a good idea.*
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;COAL WHIP&lt;/b&gt;.*
[HERO] *Seize the girl&apos;s shoulders and stare past the black gaze of the demon. She can do this - &lt;i&gt;fight.*&lt;/i&gt;

The Black Ring and the Divine Order are both trying to rid the world of the Godwoken.
*Amadia stretches her hand out, and you feel a warm glow spread through your bones. You feel... a sensation that you have not felt in a very, very long time.*
Betty the turtle died.
*Tell the spirit to calm down - no more harm can befall her.*
*He nods to a bloody corpse in Magister&apos;s garb crumpled in the doorway.*
*Her voice is clipped and detached, with metallic overtones. It even seems to &lt;i&gt;echo&lt;/i&gt;, as if she is speaking to you from very far away.*
*She chuckles.*
You had your chance. Now all your life you&apos;ll wonder: &lt;i&gt;what if...&lt;/i&gt;
Nasty trap that deals [1] in a [2] radius.
And of course, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; won&apos;t do.
*Sigh* We&apos;ve had this conversation already, remember? &lt;i&gt;No visitors.&lt;/i&gt;
Yes?
So. How&apos;s the eviction going?
Start from the beginning. Start from where you come.
Well, well. Someone&apos;s feeling awfully big. A big ol&apos; piss off to you too!
On your way, traitor, before I&apos;m tempted to win the everlasting admiration of my peers - by putting a blade to your gut.
If you must know, there is an excavation site at the Blackpits on Reaper&apos;s Coast. I go to seek answers.
Yes... I know what that means... headin&apos; for the Joy, we are... and after that...
Final warning! There will be no changing your game&apos;s difficulty after this. Are you sure you want to continue in Tactician Mode?
It was no way to live. Me and the others, we decided it was time for a change...
Earned my title with a little help, did I. A set of armour enchanted by the Source King himself, of which in my possession, only this fine coat remains.
To the world it may be a simple thread, but to a broken garment, it may be the world. Pair with a needle for the ultimate experience.
*Shake your head.*
Uh, okay. If you say so.
*Scoff* &lt;i&gt;Please. &lt;/i&gt;He destroys people for the love of it. If we must do this, it&apos;s to save the thousands he&apos;d feed on in future.
Flaming Dagger
Now to harvest a few samples, gather some Source orbs, and craft a new mask.

*Ask him why he lingers here. There could be more Magisters about.*
*Lie and say you just need to reach into your pack to retrieve a farewell gift...*
What my friend wishes to say, is that Alice went into the Cloisterwood collecting herbs, and hasn&apos;t been seen in some time. But that there, just down the way, is her house. She has a frog. You can&apos;t miss it.
*Say he may have chosen you, but you had no say in the matter. He has thrust this responsibility upon you.*
Demolishers
But these fiends resurrect those they have use of... please - consume my spirit. I don&apos;t want to come back. I don&apos;t want to be their slave.
Bird &amp; Wind Forest 04
Magister Advocate
The others have picked up the taint of their mortal pets, and contaminated this world accordingly.
*Even through the seals of the great cistern, you scent the acrid sting of the Deathfog inside.*
*Dead flesh doesn&apos;t ask questions. You could kill and eat him, or have his answer now.*
Brother - I suggest praying to Lucian on this, the holiest of days. He can mend every heart, cure every...
What&apos;re you doing? What&apos;s that?
Looking for, uh, something special?
*The blood-flecked beak lunges at you, hammering at the empty socket where your eye once was.*
*Wave away the apology. All you&apos;re interested in are the reasons for his actions.*
I do not know it, I &lt;i&gt;dream &lt;/i&gt;it. There will come a time when those who despise our customs will rise up and make war, Prince. In my dreams, I see the battles. I smell the blood of our fallen.
The Source King insists there are no magicks too foul, even those that would block, or even remove, the Source within an individual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I delight in his madness. It is an invitation to manipulate all which we once believed immutable. He provides all manner of experimental subjects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The text beneath lists a series of hexes and materials required for muting Source. Some of those objects are circled in black ink, and annotated as follows.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helm?&lt;br&gt;Collar?&lt;br&gt;Mask?
Dark Swamp
*Well you&apos;re just glad you could get him out of that factory.*
*Ask what she&apos;s doing here. And, for that matter, what are &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;doing here?*
*Pocket it.*
I will restore the homeland of the elves. Good as new. Just as if &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; never destroyed it...
*Inform her that Ryker&apos;s can&apos;t hurt her, or anyone else. Not anymore. The servants are free.*

But I&apos;ll not speak of him and his methods. Not now anyway. If ever.
Alice Alisceon&apos;s Pain
Infect
You would trade every soul in Rivellon for the sake of knowledge? You would make a ferocious librarian.
Be quick about it. I do not have the luxury of time.
*Tell her the Shadow Prince accuses the Mother Tree of being at the root of a terrible plot - one that threatens the world.*
Mind what you&apos;re doing, idiot!
That&apos;s putting it bloody lightly! Nobody deserves to rot in a hole like this.
No. I can&apos;t let you in. Creatures like this &apos;Windego&apos;, they mask themselves as one of us. Their words and songs are mesmerising. Give her a minute, and you won&apos;t know what&apos;s real from what isn&apos;t.
Open your bags! I must see their contents.
*She clamps her hands over her ears and shuts her eyes. She rocks back and forth, deaf to your words.*
Isn&apos;t our innate superiority gratifying? These Seekers come to us, their masters, and try to bend us to their will. And when we - we nascent &lt;i&gt;gods &lt;/i&gt;- express our true selves and refuse to obey, they turn... huffy.
*Say you see an elf.*
[1] increases your hitpoints total by [2]%.
I&apos;m a good Magister, loyal... but Dallis... something about her has changed - she&apos;s toying with dark magic, like a common Sourcerer. She used to... &lt;i&gt;to sing&lt;/i&gt; to the ship. It let her control it.
Knowing the reputation of Braccus Rex, we should tread gingerly...
Salmon Pie
*The Paladin wistfully hums a tune. You recognise the air. &apos;Smoke Gets In Your Hair.&apos;*
Search the house.
She&apos;s been found dead, I heard... I thought she was another victim maybe... but this changes everything...
We&apos;ve uncovered the Academy where I did my research! Where my old life ended! Perhaps here, a new life begins...
Lagan
*You marshall your will and imagine yourself massive and dangerous. You try to force the thing back, to enforce your claim within your own body.*
I&apos;ve seen them - sucking up ghosts. Swallowing them whole. They cannot be stopped. They cannot be destroyed!
It was a long time comin&apos;.
*Ask her how she got involved with Griff&apos;s thugs. She doesn&apos;t seem the type for shakedowns and skull-bashing.*
To think someone had the nerve to murder Magisters...
*A skeptical eyebrow arches upwards.*
*Cheer Gareth on. If he wants to slay Alexandar here and now, you have his back.*
Reach the tomb of Lucian the Divine.
Dallis Schmallis. Unless she jumps into my head and starts fighting for real estate, I&apos;m not too worried about her.
*Hold your head to his chest, listening for a heartbeat.*
Let&apos;s talk about whatever&apos;s on your mind when we&apos;re free of this place.

GET THE HELLS AWAY FROM ME!
*The spirit purses his lips and shakes his head ruefully.*
Very well. The blood does not lie. But my warning still stands:
Crafting Bible, Part XV
One of us drank the witch&apos;s potion and turned into a cow. There must be another potion...
*Carved onto the face of the altar is a dedication...*
*In the deepest black of the girl&apos;s pupils, something moves - a gossamer tendril, fleeing deeper inside her like an underwater creature retreating into a cave.*
*Tell him to do his job. Go over there and get the Sourcerer.*
*Tell him he doesn&apos;t know the half of it.*
You are most welcome to stay and walk with me, my daughter, should you wish it. My vigil honours the Rhalic in each human child.
Seekers, well... we guard the true principles of Lucian. There are Sourcerers who can follow in his path and become Divine - &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. W-we seek them out, and protect them.
Empty Wand
*Laugh at the irony - the greatest of beauties, she shall never see herself.*

Leave me be, lizard. This traitor needs my attention.
Item is out of charges&lt;br&gt;
*Clear your throat. Did she forget she was talking to a forked-tongue devil at this very moment?*
Must&apos;ve picked up some Source...
Yup, saw ya talkin&apos; to Murga. Let&apos;s get things movin&apos;.
Oh, talking of my sisters reminds me - you young people love games, don&apos;t you?
It feels like I&apos;ve had a spike rammed through my skull. Lords above...
Hail Strike Scroll
&lt;b&gt;You are too pure! AWAY FROM US!&lt;/b&gt;
I guessed you might say that. But I also know you need hope and fellowship. Find me in Amadia&apos;s sanctuary. Friends await you.
*Say you aren&apos;t sure. You&apos;ve never known any alternative.*
*A little back and forth ensues, money crosses hands and before you know it Sebille stands back beside you all smiles.*
You&apos;ve got a right to defend yourself. And I&apos;ve got the means.
Not... dead. Not yet undead.
It&apos;s nothing on the Ancient Empire.

Now. Speak the password.
