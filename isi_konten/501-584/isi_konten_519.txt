[1]% chance to turn water and blood surfaces into oil.
Such a silver tongue. I welcome your flattery - but we both know why you are really here... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken. &lt;/i&gt;
*Nod. There&apos;s no reason for more people to die.*
*Continue holding the cloth to the wound. Take Siwan&apos;s hand and try to help her stand.*
*He places a thumb on each of your temples and one foot gently on yours.*
I found what she wanted. She made &apos;em into armour, and when she wore it, well...said the beast started talkin&apos; to her.&lt;br&gt;
[ELF] *Tell her the Ancestor is corrupted. She cannot trust it.*
Magical Ring Helm
*You see it all: The tallest of the Ancestor Trees have been lost beneath swirling clouds of Deathfog. Nothingness. Emptiness.*
Birthright? I&apos;ve been fighting for this all my life - not once have I even considered yielding. There&apos;s nothing you can say to sway me now.
*The lamp feels strangely hot to your touch. As you wipe away the years of dirt and grime, it trembles in your hand.*
Find the fugitive witch.
Exceptional Light Breeches
We died glorious deaths!
*Grunt your indifference. If he wants to play with people&apos;s lives, that&apos;s on him.*
*Look at the dead monks littering the floor. You&apos;re not so sure Gareth is still that hero.*
Lizard Warmaiden
Bats
We ventured on. Will the Doctor honour the pact? Time will tell.
*Look right and read the random name of a hunt long over.*
Flaming Arrow
There could be few justifications for using such a thing... but I&apos;d bet my beard a good few &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; exist.
Ranged Attack
&lt;i&gt;*The scent of Deathfog comes from under the ground...*&lt;/i&gt;
Indeed. I may be one of them.
*Tell her the addicts are gone - and not a drop of blood was spilled in the process.*
This military training book is concerned with the theory and practice of safely making and using grenades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the theoretical designs are truly terrifying. But not as terrifying as the tales of poor Private Osmo, whose grenade backfired in his face due to lack of attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your fervent wish: not to be like Osmo.
Away... Away... You killed me...

Silent Violence
Leave
Summon Black Cat Skillboook
*Consume his Source. There will be no release, only Void.*
*The Meistr doubles over in a violent coughing fit, struggling for breath. After a few moments she regains her composure, wiping a thin smear of blood from the corner of her mouth.*
I am feeling... well, if not good, then certainly better. I just needed time to think. Took some time to think. I had a good friendship with Jonathan while it lasted. I&apos;d rather celebrate that than mourn what can never be.
I can be free. My soul, cleansed...
*The lizard sways slightly on his feet, locked in a deep slumber.*
Iron Maul
You save us all. My girl is back. Our Scion is back.
*Inform him that you managed to save the young woman - there was a mind maggot lodged in her skull.*
Be safe out there, and don&apos;t go causing any problems.
You know the drill, Ifan. A contract&apos;s a contract. And I intend to &lt;i&gt;deliver&lt;/i&gt;.
House Exterior - Forest Worker House B
Not much, no. Never met &apos;em myself. I do know they rigged this place to holy high heaven just after settlin&apos; in, though. Some folks are &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;private.
Ice Breaker Skillbook
You must be wondering where I was. In a place outside reality, a god I don&apos;t believe in told me things about myself I don&apos;t believe. Yeah.
Stay out of our business.
Like moths to a flame, it was.
Magister Yarrow gave us a key to the Fort.
He is bound to the gauntlets you discovered. He dreamed of this place. Through his longing, I can speak.
Lava is lethal. A lava surface cannot be destroyed or transformed. If you see lava, it&apos;s time to relocate to... somewhere else.
Toque
Poor creatures&apos;re better off dead.
Back again? I&apos;m glad.
[RED PRINCE] *Ask Slane who would dare to chain a dragon in body and mind. Who possibly could?*
Oh, by all that is holy! Your Highness is too... courageous for my taste. Such bravado does not favour my *cough* constitution.
*Ask her about the goddess Amadia.*
...at least I got us where we wanted to go. This is Arx. This is where Dallis has fled, with the powers of the gods. This is where the path to Divinity leads.
I should have guessed you had a sweet tooth! Enjoy this sampling. I hope you enjoy the smooth finish. Bliss.
*Agree. Every dwarf you&apos;ve known loves a good drink and a good argument.*
Just leave me be. I&apos;ve got some things to sort out in me mind.
Well you can&apos;t have any, &lt;i&gt;serpent&lt;/i&gt;. You and your kind aren&apos;t entitled to whatever you like - go and speak to Lovrik if you want stew, and have gold to hand, like everyone else.
*As you tell him the filthy gag, you can see him struggling to maintain his composure. He fails, and tears stream from his eyes as he laughs uncontrollably.*
One more word, Lohse.
He scarred me, so I scarred him. Extensively.
Pedigree or moggie - it doesn&apos;t matter. Not here. Not anymore...
Undead
Well, you may be innocent of one crime, but you sure are guilty of others.
Apathy. A more dangerous attitude than pure malice. I fear my musings have taken up too much of your time already. I bid you farewell.
*The Ancient Empire assassinated her, then sought to scour every mention of the her from history.*
*Tell him that you are Godwoken, with a claim on Divinity. He is but an upstart. A relic. A pebble on the path. You shall put the great Source King back in his box.*
*&apos;I          K   N   O   W.&apos;*
*You kick and struggle weakly, desperately trying to catch a breath, but the dwarf &apos;s grip is iron.*
*Ask for his master&apos;s name.*
My leader should be here for this.
We slipped her island without too much of a to-do. The Divine Order isn&apos;t as all-powerful as it likes to think.
Lovrik is dead.
Lucian said it was a necessary evil. Me? I was just sorry we didn&apos;t get the lot of you.

Teleport Party
Close-fitting and flexible, these scalemail gloves were designed for military officers.
&lt;i&gt;Much &lt;/i&gt;magic? I was controlling the powers of the universe while your people were still... doing whatever it is you used to do. What specialty would you prefer?
*Ask her what she&apos;s planning to do with the book you gave her.*
*The spirit shivers and shimmies - and then is gone to the Hall, relieved of his mortal pain and penitence.*
Weak Hull Fragment
Haaaaah! No! Not at all... &lt;i&gt;unnnnh... &lt;/i&gt;This pain right now... &lt;i&gt;gnnrr... &lt;/i&gt;is from taking root... &lt;i&gt;hmmmph. &lt;/i&gt;This pain is good! Haaaaah! This pain... &lt;i&gt;gnnnnrrr... &lt;/i&gt;is life!
Painting of Amadia
As far as I can tell, he&apos;s doin&apos; the queen&apos;s dirty work.
Waiting for other Players...
Spirit of Sadha
Such a silly game we play. To be a god - it&apos;s quite wasted on mortals if you ask me. We are all of us too blemished to become immaculate.
*Say you&apos;re after someone who can strike up-close, but deal damage from afar as well. A Battlemage would do.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca] gold)
Rock Paper Scissors
*Shrug. You can understand that.*
Useful? Ah. You mean deadly. Used to make bows &apos;n&apos; fletch arrows, but left that hobby behind.
Why Mister ben-Mezd! How good to see you!
Did you hear that this ship is alive, and &lt;i&gt;awake? &lt;/i&gt;I didn&apos;t think we&apos;d have to ask the damn thing nicely to take us away from here...
...but please. Don&apos;t go. Not yet...
*Sebille touches your arm.*
Sort
Lucian&apos;s dead and so are you, thief! MOTHER! There&apos;s a robbererer! MOTHER!
Take this book, for example. I understand all of it, and yet none of it makes sense.
Basic Bow
Forbidden Library
The one and only. And has he agreed to take a look into that very lovely, very demonic mind of yours?
Search the Blackpits for Black Ring.

*Thank him for his fine work, then hint that you&apos;ll commend him to your superiors.*
Heh! Nice try, Midge. Now, uh... put that shiner away and I&apos;ll shave a little off the top, how &apos;bout.
The real Dallis didn&apos;t volunteer herself to me, mind you. Curiosity led her to the tomb; my hunger for Source took care of the rest. I presume her bones remain there.
*Bite down on the side of your tongue - &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt;. Jolt yourself awake.*
This egg is a sign - a gift from the gods. Eat it, take its power!
Was Kemm spying on the Sallow Man? Or... were they in league?
Silence the voice in your head.
Get away you... you &lt;i&gt;BRUTE!&lt;/i&gt;
*Drop the issue. You have more pressing questions.*
Squeeee squeee!
*Say you&apos;re looking for someone who can strike from a distance with a bow or crossbow - a Ranger would do.*
Okay. I admit that one still creeps me out sometimes. Don&apos;t judge me too harshly. We&apos;re still good, yeah?
The Hall of Echoes was under attack from the Void. I must find the Council of Seven on the Nameless Isle. At the Well of Ascension, I&apos;ll become Divine.
*Keep out of their affairs and take your leave.*
[1] determines what you can craft and the quality of your crafted items. The higher, the faster you craft.
I give you the most valuable thing I own if you help us now. This I promise.
*Say that it could have been a lucrative job...*
*She&apos;s real. She&apos;s actually real! Beg her to tell you where the others are - you can&apos;t find your people anywhere.*
You&apos;ve got more miracles in you, Lohse. With you, what was impossible seems... possible again.
*Shake your head and walk away.*
[FANE] *At last, someone that speaks this brutal tongue with a little elegance.*
*The dwarf reaches into a barrel and pulls out a fish. His knife glides through the scales, crimson guts spilling out in its wake.*
[IFAN] *Say that you value truth over games.*
Whit-whoo! &lt;i&gt;Hoot!&lt;/i&gt;
*Decline. You have a companion to think about.*
And I thought we was gonna be friends. Go on, sling your hook.
It all feels kind of pointless.
*With a smile she propels you towards the bed. You fall backwards onto the soft mattress. She jumps on you. Kisses you.*
Yes. They are cut down. Destroyed and defiled. But our roots run deeper than any know. Our roots cross the world many times over.
Traps: Pressure Plates
Shame is powerful. Shame destroys authority. I am their Mistake. If they were to tell the truth about me, they&apos;d lose their authority. And rightly so, if you ask me. I&apos;ll kill them for that, if for nothing else.
Just tell them I&apos;m safe. No matter what happens.
House Interior - Upstairs A
*The man swaggers up, shaking out the limbs that were bound tightly by the Magisters. As if this were a tavern outhouse rather than a bloodbath, he smiles lazily at you, revealing teeth capped with reflective black metal.*
I hadn&apos;t pictured it like this. I mean... I guess I hadn&apos;t pictured it at all.
*Reveal that Dallis has come to the Cathedral with the aim of entering Lucian&apos;s tomb. Ask if the Hammer succeeded.*
*The woman doesn&apos;t acknowledge you, and instead stares at the bodies of her fallen comrades.*
Only she knows if she atones for her sins.
*A young Magister stands pale and silent. Her knuckles whiten around her weapon as you pass.*
*Tell him that&apos;s some sound advice.*
*Tell him his mother did what she did to protect him. He should go seek shelter, like she told him.*
*The spirit paces up and down, completely absorbed in his own thoughts and definitively uninterested in you.*
