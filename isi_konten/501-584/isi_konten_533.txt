*Ifan undresses you, slowly, removing every last stitch of clothing from your body. The warmth of his own body ensures you feel no cold, and the warmth of his gaze ensures you feel no embarrassment.*
Source Vampirism
*Note that Isbeil seems to hold much sway here. Was attacking Arx &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; the queen&apos;s idea?*
WOOSH! I magic&apos;d you - you&apos;re dead!

Glenna Graeme
We were creatures  of power once. We served our lord Braccus Rex in all things. Well - most things...
We have a wager. Some say she succeeds. Some say not. What say you?
She senses us... be calm and quiet... no sudden moves...
Go on from here to become our god as well...
Hullo. Got any more money?
Reckon I do. Knowing Siva, she sent you lookin&apos; for Sourcerers, I bet.
I do not take your word for it. You are dripping with guilt.
And the more p-p-p-p-powerful the Sourcerer, the better the Gheist they make... all the better to serve &lt;i&gt;H-H-HIM!&lt;/i&gt; For to him we pray, always.
The Adventurer&apos;s Field Guide&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The funniest thing I&apos;ve seen was a kid pretending to be a knight. He knocked a cooking pot into shape and put it on his head for a helmet. Couldn&apos;t see anything. I bet that&apos;s not very different from wearing a real helmet. It&apos;s made of iron, and blocks your vision.

Come at me then! Let&apos;s find out if your blood is as red as your skin!
There&apos;ll come a time when you need a loyal mate, &apos;n&apos; you&apos;ll be wishin&apos; you had the Beast at your side. When that day comes, remember this moment. You remember how you chose bloodlust over brotherhood as the Void drags ya in.
Very well, milady.
When you have awoken your full potential, when you have ascended to divinity, paths will unfurl before you as you choose.
Sech Zapor has met his true death.
Ksst. Go on, keep moving.
&lt;i&gt;AAAAAAAAA&lt;/i&gt; - ! Wait, what?
Search for the rest of the four heroes&apos; valuables.
It is almost enough! A few more hits. She comes back to us when she is weaker!
Did the Paladins chase you away from the Cathedral then?
*Tell them you have two bottles of the potion.*
Mace
Ryker&apos;s Rest
I mean, at this point it&apos;s just tacky...
Ready? Let&apos;s go.
He also claimed that all it takes for evil to prevail is for virtuous men to do nothing. And I will not let evil prevail.
You are whippet thin, implying you&apos;ve been a captive. Your wrists have seen the sun, but your neck has not, so you sported a collar, not shackles. Thus, you escaped Fort Joy.
*Draw your weapon. The captive goes free.*
*Smile wryly and say that &apos;pilgrimage&apos; sounds rather ironic given your mission.*
*Ask her if she feels at home now.*
You... you had me there for a moment. I&apos;m sorry, my humour&apos;s not what it once was. We&apos;re all very anxious here.
No! I&apos;m not finished! It can&apos;t end like this-!
With the face-ripper, Fane will tear the faces from corpses and combine them with Source orbs to make a Mask of the Shapeshifter.
Nothing - and Kemm is getting restless. We&apos;ve got to make something happen, and soon.
Peasant&apos;s fare, but quite satisfying anyway.
The Black Bull
*Say that buys him a reprieve, but you still have some questions.*
*Wonder what it is she&apos;s offering you.*
Gareth will know what to do. He&apos;ll take care of us...
You&apos;re mistaken to think I am so easily persuaded. Think about that in your prison cell.
Cathedral
Learn how to enter the Council.
...you&apos;re a brave lad, waltzing in here now...
If this is someone&apos;s twisted idea of a joke, I&apos;m not waiting for the punchline.
Griff was killed.
Lord FÃ¤dr al Lyes
*Tell him that&apos;s none of his business.*
*Tell him it&apos;s been so long you can barely remember anything else. The sudden realisation makes your knees heavy and weak; it&apos;s as though you&apos;re about to fall forward...*
Folder with name &apos;[1]&apos; already exsists.
If your cursor turns red when you hover over an item, the item belongs to someone else.
Twinkle-eyes
Lucian doesn&apos;t need me. And believe me when I say... I no longer need him.
*Cough politely and ask if they could get back on track...*
*Pat the children gently on the head.*
Thar be Voidwoken!
Like me, I guess. Only bigger. You seen her, missus?
That lizard - it was a trap. A bunch of thugs came in, tryin&apos; t&apos; steal his stuff. Sister knew somethin&apos; was wrong, and barged in. It... it didn&apos;t go well...
Can&apos;t attack, cast or interact with objects. Can move.
You! Tell me, have you seen a man acting suspiciously near here? Grey cloak? Grey beard? A satchel slung over his shoulder?
[ELF] I hear but the rustle of the wind through the empty forest, and the first drops of falling rain upon the bodies of my people. They were innocent - the followers of Lucian here in Arx were not.
You&apos;re tellin&apos; me it was real? The things I remembered? The- things I did?
&lt;i&gt;I don&apos;t know. &lt;/i&gt;I stumbled across the corpses, and suddenly I&apos;m holding the helmet in my hands.
Hmph. Tir-Cendelius&apos; champion, are you? I&apos;ll give you what you need to find the Well of Ascension, but I need a small favour in return. Two small favours, really.
I&apos;s fine! There&apos;s &apos;retty stuff in the chest. &apos;eautiful stuff! O&apos;en the chest and find out!
After all I&apos;ve seen today I see your face too? That beats it all. Marcus Miles, wandering the halls like he never betrayed his queen. Do us all a favour and make your exit &lt;i&gt;quickly.&lt;/i&gt;
The creator of the Deathfog device, a lizard portalmaster named Hannag, may be somewhere in Paradise Downs.
*Ask the Red Prince what you should do next.*
What the- I was sure I saw torchlight down there...
You! You, you, you! You helped us. You brought the baby back! BACAW!
I&apos;m a wabbit. Are &apos;oo a bear?
*He smiles.*
Born to riches and luxury, you have an aristocratic bearing, eloquent speech and the finest manners.
You know, I came close to making a difference to the world. I could not find it in me to be ruthless enough. I was Godwoken... I &lt;i&gt;am &lt;/i&gt;Godwoken. But only Tir-Cendelius speaks to us now. It&apos;s too late to make a difference...
Loose Plank
Our journey will be fraught with peril: it is a pilgrimage of challenges that will require you to command Source as you once did, and wield its most powerful spells.
Terri&apos;le things! Don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest, strange lady! Everything&apos;ll go &lt;i&gt;&apos;oom! &lt;/i&gt;DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
The elf Amyro stands accused of stealing from Griff, the camp crime boss. Griff has locked Amyro in a cage.
You know what I mean, dwarf.  The elves and lizards are no better. The lot of you would drag us all into oblivion with your blind devotion to Source.
[The elegant script adorning each page of this book takes your breath away, but you lack the scholarly knowledge to decipher it. Below each stanza is a staff you presume to be musical notation - but it, too, is beyond your understanding.]
Our blood is in the soil, our ancestors in the trees, our memories in the wood. Our homeland is all of us. You forget your true self. You forget you are an elf.
&lt;i&gt;You cannot defeat usss. Strike usss down, and we will return, ssstronger.&lt;/i&gt;
There is a tree at this island&apos;s core which has special significance to my master. Think of it as hallowed, sacrosanct ground. But the Black Ring maggots writhe all about its trunk.
*Tell him that now you&apos;re here, you&apos;ll take your revenge.*
Come on, quit kidding around...
*The soul jar rocks slightly, light flashing from underneath its lid. On its rim you can just barely make out the name &apos;Gratiana&apos;.*
Don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in that tavern, but it must be a freak show in there!
[LIZARD] *Hum an old lizard lullaby, one used to comfort the young.*
*Carefully lift the box&apos;s lid.*
*Ask her what&apos;s on her mind.*
*Choose &apos;violence&apos;.*
*Fane turns and leaves, running back above-decks.*
The little girl from Bloodmoon Island survived the wreck of the Lady Vengeance. And so did her demon.
*Tell him that Alexandar was killed by Dallis.*
Between you and me... he&apos;s not. He can barely lift that bloody thing.
[This is a book of verse entitled &apos;The Erotic Adventures of Thaddeus Hotbreeches&apos;, a popular volume often gifted to newlyweds.]
Sudden Death
Absolutely not! The coffers, man, the coffers: they&apos;re to be guarded day and night!
*Very well, if that&apos;s what it takes, you&apos;ll agree.*
*Tell her you are thirsty. An offering of wine would be looked upon with favour.*
Hear the good news, kin. Saheila says we are free. The Mother is gone.
Well, the way I see it, we&apos;re supposed to learn the ways of Source from those teacher-people. It&apos;s like going to school: someone learns us a lesson, and then there&apos;s a test.
Small Shallow Grave
Well done. Sometimes... the best way from a situation... is the simplest. I hope Griff rests in peace, even if he lives in anger.
*Gareth can barely hide his unease. Change your mind: Jonathan deserves mercy.*
*Dodge the question. She needn&apos;t know your itinerary.*
Magister Ranley, Caulker&apos;s Mate of the Divine Eminence vessel, &lt;i&gt;Lady Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt; That&apos;s all the information I&apos;m giving to any of you lot, so stow your questions.
A stuffed, woven doll that looks like it could be dangerous to your enemies... if you knew what to do with it.
By enabling an add-on you are no longer able to unlock achievements.
*Say there&apos;s a difference between being dead and being &lt;i&gt;Eternal.*&lt;/i&gt;
No &apos;ad things ha&apos;en if you o&apos;en the chest. I SWEAR!
High Quality Air Essence
Hoot! Hoot-to-&lt;i&gt;whoo!&lt;/i&gt;
Give the cow the second potion.
*The Knight &lt;i&gt;rams &lt;/i&gt;his fists into his helmet - the metal groans inwards. Surely none could survive such pressure... and yet...*
*Ask her where you should start looking.*
And then whispered...
Fire Whip Skillbook
*She gently twists the amulet in her hand, fingers counting every rivet and screw.*
Power is a pleasure unto itself, my dear. Believe me, I know...
Thought so.
Thought you died in the Deathfog! Thought you died a hero, but I s&apos;pose it&apos;s better to &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; as one...
Go and see the boss. Roost Anlon. He&apos;s got a soft spot for travellers with something interesting to say. So go interest him.
*Tell her to relax. You&apos;ve found the Magister killer!*
*He stands there, unarmed, and hopelessly outnumbered. He turns his gaze on you. His glare bores into you - he&apos;s about to die, &lt;i&gt;and it&apos;s your fault.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her Isbeil is dead.*
In the interest of efficiency and to ensure my quick return to the mainland, please empty your pockets in advance! Thank you, please come again! Hahahahahaha!
*Carefully keeping her eyes trained on yours, Gill tosses you the clothes you were wearing.*
What are you waiting for?!
*The ship&apos;s deck rocks suddenly, as if out of spite. You&apos;re forced to adjust your footing.*
The Magisters&apos; list named several Sourcerers who may help us master our Source powers.
*Ask her what she means. What did he die doing?*
*Ask if he can answer a few questions for you.*
Your death will be slower. More painful. But fair enough, if you insist.
The authority being your own, I had hoped, but fair&apos;s fair: I asked for the demon to be killed and I have what I desired. Time to live up to my end of the bargain and teach you.
*Jahan strokes his chin as he surveys the pilgrim camp. He notices you approach, turns, and smiles his stern smile.*
