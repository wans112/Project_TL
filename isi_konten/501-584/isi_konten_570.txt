Hey. So... this is kind of awkward, but... I&apos;m starting to get the feeling you and I aren&apos;t really... of a mind. You know what I mean?
*Open wide...*
Altar of Xantezza
Find out what Eithne did with the book.
*There&apos;s nothing in the spirit but pain - its own and that of its captive. He resists the agony, but it&apos;s only a matter of time before the spirits tear his Source away. The pain begins to hurt you too.*
Now I don&apos;t blame you for being sceptical: it shows a penchant for logic. But logic, dreams and prophecy make for an ill-tasting cocktail indeed.
We had an egg, a little eggy baby. Now, it&apos;s gone, gone, gone...
Let it be a warning to you, Sebille! I, the god who &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; you, tremble!
Tell you what: promise me we&apos;ll go out of our way to find a Dreamer and I&apos;ll join you; I&apos;ll fight by your side.
*The smell is appalling. But you eat it anyway.*
I know only of the cook, prince! Griff! He flavours his dishes with more than salt and rosemary. He has the leaf... The costly leaf.

Not an actual paradise, of course. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s such a place in all of Rivellon! Paradise Downs. My parents still sow the soil there. And if the Order hadn&apos;t called me to its ranks, I&apos;d still call their farm my home.
Braccus kept us to craft the tools of his rule. We made traps, weapons - you name it. Much based off ancient texts that he&apos;d found in some dank tomb or another.
*Admit you may have - entirely accidentally - served the Void... once or twice.*
*Express bewilderment: he&apos;s been expecting you?*
Conformists fall in line, no genius rises...
*The Seeker musters a content smile... before coughing up a gout of blood. He slumps, unconscious.*
*Shrug. Not really. You&apos;re more in the market for an exorcist than a well.*
Dean&apos;s Notes
Projectile deflected!
*You&apos;ve a craving of your own - one for Source. Consume his.*
*The little boy looks at you. He picks his nose.*
*The queen nods back; she would see justice done.*
You are up to no good.
Mmmm. Tender, juicy... much better than the stale old muck Ryker pushes through my boudoir door.
*You glance at your hand. Two Purple Monarchs! A hard hand to beat.*
Archer Trader
*Zapor tilts his head. The vertebrae in his neck bulge unpleasantly while he thinks your words over.*
Are you sure you want to return to the main menu?
My dear sweet girl, I&apos;ve grown to trust you. More than I&apos;ve trusted anyone since...
Torch
*...and so does she, and you will remember the beauty of that smile until beyond your dying day, the last thing you ever saw, before the veil came down - because now your sight is fading.*
Find Zaleskar.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell him you&apos;re going to use the Rhodeyan Ruse. It may save his skin.*
Sightless eyes stare in terror at whatever horrors marked their last moments.
*The spirit catches the ghostly bouquet and lets out a whoop of joy... that rapidly turns into a shriek of terror as she is consumed.*
Perhaps not. But at times it is best to conquer that which repulses us.
...and then a flask of whiskey for the trail.
A skin sack for storing coins, dice, and, apparently, small body parts.
Then again, I am somewhat... isolated here.
I don&apos;t care if we have to tear this place apart plank by plank - we &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;find him!
A Sourcerer? Hah! Second-rat wizards, by my book. The reddish-coloured fleshbeasts &apos;round here string &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;kind up by their hands.
Heh. You think you could get away with it. Well, off to prison with you!
*Stay quiet.*
Narin
I&apos;ll tell you something about Zorl-Stissa. She doesn&apos;t listen. Know how I know?
Magilla&apos;s Journal
Your bones are bleached by the sun, but not about your neck. You wore a collar, and thus you were in Fort Joy.
Join the Seekers and head for the beach.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 20: Summoning
Corpse Explosion Scroll
Oi! You ain&apos;t supposed to know that! Better silence ya right quick!
Well done, my prince. The Red Princess is dead. The dream of dragons undone. This is excellent news.
The stats of the summons will depend on caster level and [1] ability.
*Nod in agreement. You&apos;re perfectly capable of learning how to store more Source - you can do anything.*
So we&apos;ve, uh, seen some things, yeah? Hehehehehehe...
*The wind seems to search you for space it can inhabit, but it is expelled with your next out-breath.*
Do excuse me. Ever so tired.
Dear me, have you lost your path? Simply choose a direction and ambulate until you strike the shore.
*Ask her what she means by that.*
You look lost. Also you look crazy. And you look kinda... dangerous... so I immediately wish I hadn&apos;t just called you crazy. Don&apos;t hurt me, I can&apos;t help myself!
*He chuckles, and pokes the inside of his cheek with his tongue.*
*You hold a parchment up to the light and point at it. It is there - there that Anathema can be found.*
*Nod indignantly.*
The following addons were enabled on save, but are now disabled in the mod menu:&lt;br&gt; [1] &lt;br&gt;Loading the save could cause the game to crash.&lt;br&gt;Continue without these addons?
*One eye squints. The other bulges out even further as if to compensate.*
*She gives you a warm grin, and hums a few random notes before catching herself and clearing her throat.*

*Say you don&apos;t want any trouble and will be on your way.*
I laid everything I had at your feet, Lohse. Freedom from the gods. The chance to become something greater than yourself.
*That&apos;s too rich for your blood. Hands up, back away.*
Had a bit of family trouble lately. My girl Marla got it in her head to come after me with a shortblade.
*He tosses you a pouch.*
Then the Voidwoken came. And... and the Magisters took Griff away, to Fort Joy. Said he was luring the monsters in, like my sweet Griff would ever do such a thing.
You have my thanks. You have the city&apos;s thanks.
A shepherd in wolf&apos;s clothing. They beat me for &lt;i&gt;helping &lt;/i&gt;Sourcerers. Children. We were trying to... to help them &lt;i&gt;escape&lt;/i&gt;.
A simple round metal shield that simply does the job.
Well, that&apos;s one kind of melody, I&apos;ll give ya that. Everyone&apos;s got one in &apos;em - ya just gotta look. Me brother Laslor couldn&apos;t carry a tune in a bucket when he were a wee thing. Now, he&apos;s got the voice of an angel.
*Hold back and go easy; you don&apos;t want to hurt her.*
I&apos;ve a lot of planning to do, now that there&apos;s &lt;i&gt;not to be a new divinity.&lt;/i&gt;
Are you deaf? Your business here. &lt;i&gt;Now.&lt;/i&gt;
A vial of blood labelled &apos;Dorotya&apos;
The Seven watch o&apos;er us, you&apos;re safe in bed.
*As you approach the door again, the face composes itself once more from the shifting wood. It &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to sneer at you, though that could be no more than a knot in the wood above its temporary lip.*
Is. Your buffalo. Unwell?
*Say you never asked for any of this. Stand tall.*
*The look on your face says you have to kill him now. You raise the dagger...*
*Reassure her - it&apos;s going to be okay.*
I don&apos;t need or want a souvenir of your brutal journey. Do with it as you will.
You are my chosen: Now you must become the champion of our kind. The champion of humanity.
Meat
*He covers your hand with his.*
The Doctor, he treatscureshelpshaunts the sick, the ill, the needydiseasedhurtingsadhappyhealthy. His house, the Black House, the doomdoctormiraclehouse!
*He nods towards the bodies of the dead Magisters, twisted in the thorned blood.*
*The kin&apos;s brow knits together, then apart, and back again. He seems to be swimming deep in his thoughts and doesn&apos;t look up as you approach.*
Things are falling into place...
This one I remember. Hardwin and I served together, back in the war. Let me do the talking?
*...he snorts back and spits between the iron bars, right onto your face.*
Until we failed.
*Recoil; you don&apos;t know what lies beyond.*
Go. You&apos;re done here.
The loyal shall be rewarded...
*Play nasty.*
Range: [2]&lt;br&gt;Damage dealt depends on your weapon&apos;s damage rating.
Come on, come on, come over here...
You there. Dwarf. I&apos;m looking for an inmate. A smallish man, thick spectacles, prone to... somewhat eccentric chatter. He wears a large bronze pendant with a dragon stamped into it.
The First Passion Of Lucian
Ifan supports my claim on Divinity. He shall stand beside me at the Wellspring.
*A push, a pivot, and now you suddenly face her, the needle still all too deeply embedded in the side of your throat.*
*Tell her she would have done the same in your shoes.*
Spirit of an Orc Priest
The Voidwoken. They got her. I... I saw it...
*The Paladin grits her teeth and readjusts her grip on the wound.*
*As you approach the dwarven scientist, Ifan pulls you aside.*

Herb-sister goes on and on, but can&apos;t say I hear the mouthwords. It&apos;s mostly drops of purple and treesongs that come to me.
Going to be a grim harvest here this year...
Mind what you&apos;re doing, fool! I won&apos;t warn you again!
*Grunt. And what do you need to do?*
It seems you&apos;re a born survivor, Sebille. Let&apos;s hope we can get this ship moving, so your efforts won&apos;t have been in vain...
Baby, baby, baby... I told you to go back. I &lt;i&gt;told &lt;/i&gt;you!
One of the cabins seems to have become infested with tentacles and some sort of lethal fog. We should keep our distance.
*Admit the voices have dwindled to just one, and it&apos;s been quiet on the matter.*
Completing the triptych of the Three Passions of Lucian opened a secret door.
Your offer
You can&apos;t understand what this animal is trying to say! If you had the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Pet Pal Talent&lt;/font&gt;, you could have a meaningful conversation.
Oh, but you&apos;re a clever one, Mister Miles, aren&apos;t you? Fine - you&apos;ve outed me. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
*His face is thoughtful as he chews your flesh, savours it, and slowly swallows it down.*
Something that will make you understand that for a god there is precious little difference between the living and the dead.
The goddess... she just... she... You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;covered &lt;/i&gt;in blood!
*Say that the Magisters are already hunting a suspect - a tinkerer named Higba.*
You wash yer mouth with soap, lad! I&apos;d slap ya straight if you weren&apos;t so damn big!
[NOBLE] *Mention he&apos;d gain more from having you - and your connections - as allies.*
*Inform her that Ryker&apos;s can&apos;t hurt her, or anyone else. Not anymore. The servants are free.*
[SCHOLAR] *Look at the vines closely. Something about them is familiar.*
*Fine. Turn away.*
Almira bade us search the Blackpits for a particular tablet. With it, she&apos;ll fashion a Swornbreaker and unbind herself from the God King.
*A vision of a cave entrance appears, and too the huge troll guarding it. You must bring the head of Alexandar there, and present it to the altar. You mark your map, and the mirror goes dark once more.*
Praise Lucian, but I see the Divine light shining from within you. Please, I beg you - spare me. I can&apos;t die - &lt;i&gt;I can&apos;t leave my darlings alone!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you have no idea what happened, but she&apos;s dead.*
