The dreamer Bahara can take me further into the realm of dreams. First, I must escape the Fort.
One of your own? You are more Godwoken than dwarf. Besides... the poor dear...
*Glance at the barrel suspiciously. But if he&apos;s not responsible, who is?*
*The young man looks to the Magister, then promptly spits in his face. The Magister scowls, wipes away the sputum, and nods to the executioner. There is no prayer.*
Yeah. You definitely are. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s up with you, but something isn&apos;t right. Not to me, at least.
*Smile on.*
Why do you hide? Why do you fear? Do you not...? Do you not remember, Sebille?
*Say that you know he was looking for this man as well, but the Master... he &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to die.*
Not right now. Come back later.
Winter Field
*Try to squeeze out a few words: this is his last chance to let you go!*
This is incredible. I&apos;ve never felt such power!
*She doesn&apos;t lift her gaze from her drink. She&apos;s not interested in you at all.*
*Try to talk your way out of this.*
Moving to hazardous concoction generator!
*Her armour - say you&apos;ve never seen its like before.*
Eternal &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;now? I don&apos;t know half of what your talkin&apos; about, but I can tell one thing: You got a curious mind. And as you figured out by now, the Magisters ain&apos;t too big on curiosity.
A woman of principle. I get it. Wonder how you&apos;ll feel when whoever did this does it again.
Mask of the Shapeshifter? &lt;i&gt;That&apos;s&lt;/i&gt; something I want to craft. And fast.
*Sigh* If that&apos;s how you really feel, Lohse... this will all be so much messier than it needs to be.
And you shall haff more! You may e&apos;en kill a Godvoken, if you can find one. Maybe e&apos;en old Alex himself!
Seeker Rallying Point
...lost in mem&apos;ry, present gone from sight.
I must go.
I can feel Lord Eredor&apos;s power surging through me... my fingertips are alive with fiery energy!
Ship - Wrecked Interior A
&lt;i&gt;Your soul does not belong to Duna. Why do you call on his Undertaker, the Death-that-Feasts?&lt;/i&gt;
I wish you good luck and great fortune. &lt;i&gt;Obviously.&lt;/i&gt;
*Scoff. This is no time for games.*
*Maeve&apos;s warning is still fresh in your mind. You decide to not risk it, and take your leave.*
Dungeon? You have the gall to call my laboratory a dungeon? I&apos;d be quite annoyed with you if you didn&apos;t look so honestly perplexed.
Thank you! Now, moving along...
*Stand back. Allow Tovah&apos;s touch.*
A bug squasher, are you? Impressive.
I must admit, despite what she did to me, I can&apos;t help but admire her a little... the woman is unwavering. She will break before she bends...
*Suppress your fears and accept Dorotya&apos;s kiss.*
Hrrmm... Clearly you have had some modicrum of education in your time.
&lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt;
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
Maybe we&apos;ll see each other again some time?
*Ask why he doesn&apos;t help them down.*
Y-yes, Sir! Th-thank you, Sir!
I taste more than... you. The blood of a swarm. It lingers there. You have been kissed before - and suffered for it.
Thanks, pet. Much obliged for letting all the blood out of that Magister for me.
*Snirfle*
The Vulture&apos;s Mask
*Wave a hand before his face.*
Dammit!
Pretty sure we can safely say that they &lt;i&gt;didn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt;.
The Path of Common Knowledge
Looks like... the hilt of a blade? Its power is almost overwhelming.
Breaks when casting or attacking.
Find everything you wanted?
Tome of the God King
Your powers must be many. You are a model of your kind, and even more incredibly, of mine!
*Say that you were shipwrecked, and swam ashore to this island.*
Flaming Knife
Kedelon the Bone Crusher
[SOLDIER] *Explain that they just need to be organised. Any enemy can be overcome.*
*As your vision clears the spirit is revealed - the famous poisoner known as the Black Widowmaker, shunned by all the Houses. He has eyes only for the lizard Lone Wolf who stands before him.*
*Drop your eyes submissively and tell him you&apos;re Almira&apos;s Thrall.*
Still, who I am to judge a person&apos;s tastes? You did what you were asked to do and now you&apos;ll be rewarded for it.
*Laugh. Cat got her tongue? Serves her right for being snarky.*
I&apos;d say &apos;your guess is as good as mine&apos;, &apos;cept I&apos;ve got the sense not to ask any questions. Now why don&apos;t you march on? I ain&apos;t bein&apos; paid to wag my chin.
But not all. The Nameless Isle had vanished.
And here I am, to tip my cap!
I... I ain&apos;t saying. It&apos;s a secret - for loyal members of the Divine Order only.
*Lohse looks at you nervously and smiles.*
Not so hasty.
*He turns to you, taking you in with hard, brown eyes that both comfort and terrify you.*
Rhalic, Vrogir and Zorl-Stissa favoured the sun, while Duna, Tir-Cendelius, Xantezza and Amadia favoured the moon.
*Take a rock and smash the relic.*
Well this all looks... familiar.
GO ON. Is that all you&apos;ve got?!
Dwarven Hammer
*He growls his annoyance.*
*Say you&apos;ll look out for this heirloom.*
Deal [1] and set Chilled status on enemies in the area. Freeze blood and water surfaces.
&apos;Talents.&apos; Get &lt;i&gt;out &lt;/i&gt;of here. And don&apos;t come back, if you know what&apos;s good for you.
You want to know what they said, yes? You do! I&apos;ve a spot on the beach. Tent. Fire. Come talk to me there. They really want you to. Hmmm.
Smart. In this case, I think we help each other.
Moooooooof!
Mother!
This historical tablet was engraved long ago. Dust fills the etchings like echoes of time.
Fear? Ha. Pity, perhaps. A blind wolf may lead the pack, but sooner or later they will all starve.
It seems I was *brrrksst* interfered with. My power supply was&lt;i&gt;SSskkkt &lt;/i&gt;removed *brrskt* through force. The perpetrator is unclear.
An effective method. As long as you keep control of that which you destroy.
Oh. Well, then. As you wish.
Yes, yes... I see. A pity though. A pity not to know...
Soft Touch
If they&apos;ll let it...
No! Do not-... child, I know you mean well, but please, it is not necessary. The forces of the Void have done their worst for now.
*Laugh and hold her even tighter. Even then.*
Oh, and Lohse? Lovely little Lohse? Just kill her now and be done with it...
Didn&apos;t I tell you to leave? Wasn&apos;t I clear that you&apos;re not WELCOME here?
*Ask it what is capable of incapicating the gods like this.*
*Ask about this glorious mission&apos;. What are they planning?*
And if we suspect you&apos;re hiding their killer, we&apos;ll throw you to the damn Voidwoken.
*Ifan looks uneasy, even hangdog.*
You seem more... at ease in this world than I. A guide would certainly be useful.
Portrait of Anhar
*He reaches into his robes and pulls out a dagger. Its long, thin blade looks wickedly sharp. The necromancer grins as he hands it to you and pulls aside the cloth covering his heart.*
*Ask if their investigation has been successful.*
Contaminated Magister&apos;s Foot
*Say that you know about his involvment with resurrecting Vredeman, or rather, &lt;i&gt;Braccus Rex.*&lt;/i&gt;
Cap&apos;n Ablewether ran the ship upon the rocks, although I rang the bell. That weren&apos;t no lighthouse. I rang the bell in warning and she ran the ship upon the rocks!
Fire Resistance
I see you, dear one. You make us proud again.
Fool. You could have just walked away.
*...and thrusts a kitchen knife right into you heart.*
Are you... are you...
You&apos;re dead, Alexandar!
[MYSTIC] *Comment that you&apos;re unfamiliar with this magic... its potential intrigues you...*
*Say that you&apos;ve found Lord Arhu. He was being held captive by Linder Kemm, but now he has sent you here so that you can learn how to traverse the Path of Blood.*
*Give him a penny. Tell him to keep the dog.*
The Watcher
Widower&apos;s Locket
Charms enemies in a cone in front of you.
Well, now we know the way to the Sawmill... &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; we know Roost thinks I&apos;m bringing you there as part of the Godwoken contract.
*Point out that some would think he just wants you to do his work for him.*
[UNDEAD] *Remark that you&apos;re glad to have been of help, and note that you prefer to be judged by your actions, not trivial matters like appearance or race.*
*Grin and nod.*
You&apos;ve already learned [1].
Nice to meet you! How&apos;s your day been?
Whoa.
Custom
...chasing off the darkness with the light!
A killer, are you? One who thinks herself a god? One who believes she can dole out justice from her own feeble palm?
*The elf grabs your arm as your turn, his grip iron. Looking back you see that all the bravado has faded from his face, leaving only a deep sadness.*
You call it Source. They put it in me. So I could watch. So I could kill. But they put in too much. I feel too much. I do not want to kill.
Go, shirk your duty! Lead your friends to death, craven!
&lt;i&gt;Adan, sh&apos;falone dumora v&apos;na voor rivelleis.&lt;br&gt;Awenou arie; demchou sh&apos;an.&lt;br&gt;Sa den menia veyit feln. Dom dris wal veyit evdekeis.&lt;/i&gt;
Go forth to my worship... Come lie upon my altar...
Black Candle
*Tell her that you saw someone matching that description, but they&apos;re long gone now.*
*First things first. Dragons? What is she talking about?*
Oh hi. Bye then.
*Ifan laughs. He has both of your arms held fast in his vice-like grip, and one of his feet presses your left boot to the ground. You cannot see the wolf, but you can feel a razor-sharp claw drawing blood from your right ankle.*
Wither is free! Now he can be happy - he can get &lt;i&gt;out!&lt;/i&gt;
*Your friends scream for help that will not come. You know that outside stands the Lone Wolf Pigsbane, and that he was paid to kill you. You know Pigsbane listens for your screams. All you can do is die proud.*
*He comes to you. Leans close to your ear, his breath upon you. Whispers...*
Demon Flayer
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
But don&apos;t worry. I won&apos;t stand in your way. From the moment you came back for me on that ship, I knew you were special. You&apos;ve proven it time and again.
Runes
We have to find Masters of the Source, don&apos;t we?&lt;br&gt;
Potion of Power
Take the Scroll of Atonement.
Painting of the Outlaw Empress
I&apos;d rather gain knowledge through reading a book than by eating flesh myself, but I won&apos;t judge the children of Tir-Cendelius... not after what was done to them.
Heh... heh... heh...
*Your abilities are powerful, but this time it&apos;s ready for you. Its hold on the dwarves never slips. You can hear a faint chuckle from an unseen mouth.*
*Loudly ask why Kemm invited Arhu to his home before he disappeared. It seems suspicious...*
Awrite, brother! Right glad Lohar ain&apos;t left us here to wither.
By all means, think...
Well, I think &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;should focus on getting this demon out of my head. And of course I think &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;should help me.
*Look around; what is there to be scared of around here?*
Don&apos;t just stand there. &lt;i&gt;Look.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask the little rat if she can tell you anything about this place.*
Sprouted Vines
Draw Source from your amulet.
*The whiff of chemistry assails you. But this spirit is not unhappy. Whatever was keeping him here has now lost its power. He&apos;s ready to depart...*
Knit Cap
Of course! Your servants; your champions; your worshippers. Do you... Do you not remember, Sebille?
I&apos;ve no sympathy for those who die in the line of duty. Especially as odious a duty as those dead Magisters held.
Forest - River Bridge C
Devour a corpse, inceasing damage and healing. Gain a Source Point.
