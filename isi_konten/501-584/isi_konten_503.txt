Ancient Scroll
[IFAN] *Agree. You like a friend you can spar with.*
Turns out they needed a little of &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; help to get their friend Verdas out of Fort Joy. Needed to prove myself to &apos;em; why would they take risks for me if I wouldn&apos;t take risks for them?
Now that we&apos;ve found a way out of here, I&apos;d rather spend my time aboard alone.

Prepare yourselves: I am on route to take command over our excavations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our lady Dallis has found what we seek, so those Black Ring have served their purpose. We no longer need them alive; I expect you to make arrangements to eliminate that particular liability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iâ€™ll be there sooner than you think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reimond&lt;/i&gt;

*The spirit turns to you, his mouth agape. He&apos;s gone in an instant.*
Tatcher here is one of my dearest friends, but she isn&apos;t the brightest.
You got a brain, yeah? You understand words? It&apos;s a group of kids that steal stuff. It ain&apos;t all that complicated. Least, not for smart people.
*Say that with the amount of Dorotya&apos;s venom running through your blood, it would be cannibalism for her to eat you. But you&apos;d happily give her someone else&apos;s flesh to spare your own...*

I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;busy&lt;/i&gt;.
