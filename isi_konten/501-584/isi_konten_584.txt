This is the Hall of Echoes. A vision of it, at least. We&apos;re here because there&apos;s something you need to know - a great power within you that we need to unlock.
Oh. You must think I&apos;m playing with you. I don&apos;t *ahem* &lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt;. Hand &apos;em over!
I stand with Lohse; I can&apos;t let her die like this.
Alas, I am naught but bone until I can find a suitable corpse and a device that allows me to remove its face and craft a mask.
Lohar
A length of sturdy rope - a mainstay in any traveller&apos;s pack.
*Rue that you have never been recognised for your innate &lt;i&gt;nobility.*&lt;/i&gt;
The elves avoid &apos;him. Don&apos;t blame &apos;em, really. They all look to that Saheila for guidance. Blind as a bat she is. Not sure what they&apos;re hopin&apos; to get outta her. Is she gonna &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; their way to freedom? Hehehe...
*Tell him the Mother Tree is dead - killed by a Scion.*
&apos;Abnormal seismic activity threatened primary task operations. Operator sabotage suspected. To protect core functionality and data retention, first-level security measures were activated.&apos;
Fane turned against me. He&apos;ll fight me for Divinity.
Uuggh... ahh...
An idyllic enough spot, no doubt.
*Be thankful.*
Why are the elves on the brink of extinction?
You&apos;ll see. I&apos;ll be back before you know it. The Advocate doesn&apos;t stand a chance.
Appearance
I crafted an ancient artefact named the Swornbreaker - said to free its wielder from all magical pacts... including the Covenant.
Guess I shoulda seen that comin&apos;.
&lt;i&gt;...with the he-dwarf.&lt;/i&gt;
Beyond that, I can&apos;t help you. Lord Arhu may know how to bypass other obstacles around the crypt. By design, none of us were privy to the full sequence.
*Nod to his insignia. You, too, have a penchant for wolves. What does this one represent?*
[LOHSE] *Clap him on the back and say you&apos;re sure they have it one hundred percent under control.*
Do &lt;i&gt;I? &lt;/i&gt;But you&apos;re right, you don&apos;t seem the type. The answer to your question is, unsurprisingly, a man in a house. A man in a house buys all the Void-tainted fish I can send him.
Roost Anlon, who delivered me to the Master, is dead. The Master is next.
*Say you&apos;re interested in the fate of the Bishop.*
Good gods, this dead kinsman was a Dreamer! Damnable nuisance, that: now I&apos;ll have to find another.
You almost have to admire his cunning. To think that in his guise of Daeva he and I shared the finest wines in the realm; stories of life and love. But now I know where he hides, afraid of his own name.
*Change your mind - you want to eat the egg instead.*
*Remark that it sounds like he&apos;s after something.*
Adept Enchanter
Or else what? Who&apos;re you gonna call, buck?
Has it taken you this long to figure that out?
&lt;i&gt;You spilled the blood of the Advocate. The Doctor demands a reckoning...&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her the Magisters took Gwydian, but you were able to free him.*
Now I warn you: tell me where they send the rest, or more Magisters die.
Moving to orifice manipulator!
At least you keep my on my toes, eh?
*The runes are in no language you understand or recognise. The shrine seems completely inert.*
*Ask what sort of business they were attending to.*
Gag Order Skillbook
I hope for your sake you&apos;ve got good news for me.
I&apos;m digging my murdered parents&apos; graves. I&apos;d ask that you show your respects.
&apos;Kindness&apos; is one word, I guess. Conway &apos;n&apos; I just see it as the right thing to do - no matter what. No Sourcerer deserves what the Magisters are doing. Least of all Hannag.

*Say that she&apos;ll have to pay for what she&apos;s done.*
*The word &apos;NO!&apos; fades away with the echoes of the bell, and the spirit of Seaman Stubbs is no more.*
Good to see you&apos;d rather flap yer lips than fight.
Still? Do stay hydrated, then. Wouldn&apos;t want that scowl to remain plastered on your face.
*The towering relic seems to hum with esoteric energy, faintly pulsating in time with the beat of your heart. You feel it drawing you closer, yearning for your touch, hungering for your Source.*
No, it&apos;s not him, I&apos;m certain of it! He doesn&apos;t fit the bill!
A Swornbreaker! A priceless gift indeed!
Load
*Point out that you saved the city from Voidwoken - you&apos;re not the bad guy here.*
I can&apos;t breathe...
...chasing off the darkness with the light!
Everyone makes mistakes. That&apos;s all it was - a mistake she made while fighting for her life.
*The executioner moves to his next victim - a young man who promptly spits in the Magister&apos;s face. The Magister scowls, wipes away the sputum, and nods to the executioner. There is no prayer.*
No... I&apos;m dizzy. I hit my head when the straw man threw me in the air...
