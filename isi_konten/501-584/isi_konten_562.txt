Gold? I- I don&apos;t have any gold. But- no! Wait! I have this! Here, take it!
Remember that townsfolk, guards, and enemies have their own alliances; attacking one may mean dealing with them all.
Clenched Fist
*Say you heard enough to know she&apos;s the reason so many believe Sourcerers to be evil.*
Really? Well perhaps that says more about the calibre of their intellect than anything else. Such a device would be a gross overconcentration of power - it could purge the entire world of all Source... luckily the laws of the universe render such a thing impossible.
[LIZARD] *Tell him that&apos;s a pity. Lizards are famed storytellers.*
...are you ready for me to grant you... &lt;i&gt;your greatest desire?&lt;/i&gt;
*There&apos;s quick movement behind you and a booted foot kicks your staff out of reach. You look up into the eyes of a sneering dwarf.*
Ah. You. The one who&apos;s &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;a thief - right?
I suppose I don&apos;t have to tell you her condition is... rather dire.
Line of intense heat that deals [1] to characters and leaves fire clouds behind.
I can no longer abide by the God King&apos;s will. He would scour me clean and suck me dry of all that was ever mine. I will never be among his Chosen. But I know the ones still basking in his favour.
&lt;i&gt;You smell so good.&lt;/i&gt;
And so much more! But I&apos;m no longer who I once was, bound to you as I&apos;ve become. I will teach you what I can, but the knowledge that will expand the bounds of your soul? That you&apos;ll have to hunt for yourself.
Ah, there you are, *ahem*, &lt;i&gt;husband!&lt;/i&gt;
*Say you hadn&apos;t a clue. You still find it rather hard to believe actually.*
Krug the Troll
Arrowblaster
Whatever you say. &lt;i&gt;Boss&lt;/i&gt;.
[Dozens of pages describe failed experiments with ‘Reactive Spores’. The final entry details success.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The elf knew more than he let on. It took a bit of creative convincing, but he finally pointed us in the right direction. The spore requires some kind of activation phrase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The last part of the entry is hastily-written.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The words are ‘Chm’r doran’. ‘Forever Sleep’. The thing’s full of poison. Pietr is dead. Something’s growing out of him - vines?
Power comes from strength. And strength comes from growth. These seeds sprout; so does the iron in your spine. I give my word!
&apos;Here lies the famous Sea-Captain&lt;br&gt;Horatio &quot;Red-nose&quot; Bellwether.&lt;br&gt;Sailed the seas. At last found port.&apos;
*Urge Gareth to calm. Alexandar is not Damian. He can keep his father&apos;s promise alive.*
Bugger got me *wince* pretty good.
Somehow, that woman acquired domination leashes. Had us using our Source to scry ancient stones inside the cave.
This wasn&apos;t the deal. No take-backs and no returns! Everyone repays their debts! All defaulters... DIE!
Quick Save
You fight well, and I&apos;m glad to have you with us. I doubt it&apos;ll make much difference in the end, but for now we need all the help we can get.
They are all that stand between you, me, and the Void. And they were right here just a moment ago, attending to some business.
You must help us wage our war, that peace may be, that peace may be, that peace may be...
And some sins, Lohse, can never be forgiven.
The Black Ring, you mean? Or Damian? Don&apos;t think any livewood ship&apos;s gonna head off to the Hall of Echoes.
Chin officially up, Sir Gareth!
Mmph. Pf-pf-pf.
*Answer &apos;Tenax&apos;.*
Oh, stuff! Lots of stuff! I know where it is - I&apos;ll mark it on a map for you. When I have fingers again, &apos;course.
Pressley
*This shrine to Duna may have been quite beautiful before it was so horribly defaced.*
*The elegant owlmistress glances up at you from her papers, a harried look on her face. She nods an abrupt greeting.*
The disappearances have been solved, and no thanks to you. It took an former Magister - a bloody &lt;i&gt;elf&lt;/i&gt; no less - to see the task done. At least this farce is over...
*He gulps. You smile and walk away.*
[SCHOLAR] *You try to recall learning this unusual language, but come up short. Insist it speak in a familiar tongue.*
Ha! Poor lobster. You&apos;re even sillier than I thought. In what world does treasure simply appear from on high?
Speak with the Advocate.
Combat Training Arena
Soldier
We released Karon. He transformed into the Mistake - a crazed Godwoken.
[DWARF] *Tell him you&apos;re just a dwarf, trying to survive.*
Whaddya mean?
I&apos;m sick of it. We can&apos;t hold out like this much longer. Sick of it, I am.
I did not think they would ever be stopped. I did not think they &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;ever be stopped.
I kinda need that potion.
They&apos;re our friends! Pom-pom can talk to them. They&apos;re not very clever, but she says they&apos;re nice.
You &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;think that? What do you think we are then? Cosmic accidents?
*A flicker of hesitation crosses Tarquin&apos;s face. He glances down to his wasted limbs.*
*Nod. You do not crave the company of lesser creatures.*
*The dwarf trails off as he takes in the sight of Beast. His face goes from soft to stern as their eyes meet.*
I offer my aid to those deserving; you have more than proven yourself as such. But I am no errand boy and I &lt;i&gt;do not &lt;/i&gt;come when called.
*Assume a sad face and tell him you&apos;re mightily disappointed.*
The Lord Dread awaits! Its sails &lt;i&gt;billow&lt;/i&gt; with Dallis&apos; breath! I&apos;ll...
I don&apos;t have a choice! You&apos;re the one wearing those gauntlets, dragging me around this way and that.
*The egg rapidly cools. The shell contracts... and breaks...*
Help me, Mama. The lady took something from me...
A potion capable of steeling you against the effects of air magic.
When a new cub joins up with the Lone Wolves, we interrogate them. Then, um, a &lt;i&gt;very complex equation&lt;/i&gt; decides their new moniker.
*From within the endless emptiness, a strangely familiar voice hums into being and calls to you: &apos;Godwoken... &lt;i&gt;Fane&lt;/i&gt;...&apos;*
*Lower your voice. Gently tell the creature it appears to be in terrible pain.*
You have started a multiplayer game, but nobody has joined you yet. Ideally, they should join you while you&apos;re in Character Creation. Are you sure you want to start the campaign now?
Stand aside. I must speak with this spirit.
And so you shall. After me. This is &lt;i&gt;vital!&lt;/i&gt;
DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
You&apos;re right. You were really strong - like a hero! And heroes get treasures when they finish their quests.
*Marvel at his changed form - is he a lizard or a dragon?*
Nothing&apos;s sacred anymore. Or safe.
Kick From Party
It can pay off to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;scout ahead&lt;/font&gt; before a fight. Look for enemies and other advantages. For instance, high ground will give you range and damage boosts, indicated by &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;green crosses&lt;/font&gt; on the ground when taking actions.
So the portal-master is dead. She&apos;ll do no more damage now. You have our thanks.
By the scales of my kin, these torches will not hold a flame!
*With a gentle stroke, the fourth tumbler finds its rest. Darting left and feinting right, you&apos;re learning the lock&apos;s unique rhythm.*
Brawling Axe
Seems they found what they were looking for. They found you, monkey-woman! They found you! Ook! Ook! Hahahahahaha!
I didn&apos;t escape one demon to serve another. The God King hasn&apos;t seen the last of me.
It is unthinkable. Unbearable! To know she&apos;s in the hands of such villains. I...
*Tell her you&apos;re a friend.*
*Step into her memories again.*
Say my name, you stain-brained fool. &lt;i&gt;Say my name.&lt;/i&gt;
*Reach for the great ball of light.*
*Reach out your hand. Allow a single drop of water to alight upon your palm.*
*Tell her if she&apos;s a mother to Magisters, her womb must be cursed.*
Dishes
*She pulls her hand back as if scalded, shock temporarily overpowering her.*
*Ask how you can help.*
I&apos;m sorry to hear they&apos;re dead, but that name means nothing to me. Whoever they were, I pray it was a gentle passing.
Even here, I hear his voice in dream. No matter which plane one could escape to, he is never far behind.
We told the warden what had happened to her prisoners.
As we learned that we were Godwoken, we ought to inform the Seekers of our unique nature.
Steam cross-save
But if you need proof that grim arts can lead to marvellous things, you need only look at Quercus.
Creates a [2]m [1] surface when targeting terrain
Alexandar found the island... does that mean he followed the same path as us? Does he seek the Council?
Mail Breeches
We may see no bars, but we are firmly behind them, here and now. As I hunt for answers, escape must &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; be on our minds.
Primitive Sword
*She gives you a steady, defiant stare. A spark of recognition lights up her eyes but is gone in a flash.*
The musician Lohse and the thing in her head joined the party.
Meistr Siva&apos;s house is sealed; no one appears to be home.
Gah! No! Stay back! Don&apos;t-
So much? You have to be hiding something. And I&apos;m sure Dallis will be &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; able to find out what that something is...
You do? You speak to her? You see how precious she is. How gentle.
WH-ACKAW!-AT?! What is &lt;i&gt;this?!&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her to close her eyes and keep telling herself that everything&apos;s going to be alright.*
*Say he has mistaken you for someone else and ask after the person he&apos;s talking about.*
Back! &lt;i&gt;Get back!&lt;/i&gt; I-I-I&apos;ll kill you, just like the rest of them!
*The cub stifles a sob.*
[RED PRINCE] *Remark that you&apos;re from the House of War, it&apos;d be embarrassing if you &lt;i&gt;hadn&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;killed.*
*Wonder what the Black Ring are doing here. The island&apos;s been overrun!*
But if I find you&apos;ve been interfering with Paladin business, I won&apos;t be so forgiving. You understand.
F21
I&apos;ll see you at the other end of the rainbow.
Can&apos;t you feel it? The Void? It&apos;s here. It&apos;s calling to me...
Forest - Cave Entrance B
*Decide you aren&apos;t the person to bring him this news. Tell him you misspoke.*
Atmosphere
Amethyst Deceiver
*Say that you are.*
A more potent version of the herbal mixture for Alertness; the effects should last quite a bit longer.
I&apos;m still trying not to lose me breakfast, when Herman spots the breastplate and nabs it.
*Protest. Are they sure it was Jonathan they saw?*
Get out of here, while I still let you.
