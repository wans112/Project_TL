Look. You rightfully consider me a scoundrel, but I&apos;d rather you think of me as a... lovable scamp.
Grasp the Gem Firmly
We should look out for tribal elves on Reaper&apos;s Coast. They&apos;ll want to know that Saheila was in Fort Joy.
Bandit Elf Elementalist
Mordus offered to help us with our Source powers if we&apos;d eat the heart of a Voidwoken. We turned him down.
She seems to be &apos;out for blood&apos;. I fear I may, for once, be found lacking.
I will find them. They WILL have their just reward.
My lord! I&apos;ll give you blood! I&apos;ll give it all! I beg you, my lord!
You demand too much of yourself, Red Prince. Come, rest. Feel the sun warm you.
*She comes to you. Drapes her arms around your neck. Lays her head upon your shoulders. Whispers...*
Yea, that looks really dangerous. Let&apos;s just report back. You weren&apos;t asked to deal with it.
*Shake your head. You wouldn&apos;t put it past a man like that to lock up whomever he pleases.*
Thank you... but do not underestimate him, unless you wish to meet a similar fate to my own.
Stay back! We have the dog cornered, but he&apos;s still dangerous.
Let&apos;s get our bearings.
*Give her tidings of her sister with the Seekers.*
*Tell her to guide them to a time of grand adventures: of Source Hunters and Homesteads.*
Alright, you&apos;re free to go. Don&apos;t let me see you in here again - this is a crime scene as far as I&apos;m concerned.
Yeah, you don&apos;t get to keep what you take. But you&apos;re not just walking away.
She must have been acting against Braccus Rex for him to have come for her like that.
I&apos;ll never forget you either.
Petrified
O Lucian, please return.
He&apos;s being too generous. They stopped being our friends and family when they said we couldn&apos;t be together. *Sigh.* Fulton&apos;s a Sourcerer. I don&apos;t care about that. But plenty of others around here would have.
*Throw your hands in the air. Enough. Stories!*
What&apos;s this? Burglary?!
We left Reaper&apos;s Eye without helping the pigs.
Impalement
*You&apos;re left standing on the cold, glowing cobbles. As the mists clear you see a new figure before you. A figure you know well from temples...*
[VILLAIN] *Note that she is alive while her comrade is dead; that is a victory of its own.*
*Point a harsh finger at Gareth. Jonathan must die before he can send word to Dallis.*
*You finally corner the ant by a boot, plucking him from the ground with a cluck of satisfaction. Swallowing your prize, you look up into the grinning faces of the Magisters.*
*Ifan approaches Alexandar, who lies flat on a bare wire cot. Though unconscious, Alexandar&apos;s eyes are only half-closed. His swollen jaw hangs open at an odd angle.*
*Tell the Magister he was searching for the wrong person - the chef was the real killer.*
Milk Churn
I can&apos;t believe Leya&apos;s gone. Her smile&apos;d brighten up anywhere. Even a dank crate like this&apos;un.
Kindly remove that painting from the wall.
Well that hardly seems relevant, but if you must know, I was... inconvenienced for a time.
The Sallow Man received Alexandar&apos;s head.
[MYSTIC] *Say they are indeed. You can sense a great deal of Source here. It radiates from nearly every inmate.*
Reset Tutorials on New Game
[SEBILLE] *Tell her your home was destroyed by religious folk. Folk like her.*
*As you begin to hum, something odd happens. Your song &lt;i&gt;matches&lt;/i&gt; her droning rhythm. Her dead eyes swivel to meet yours. The blackness of her pupils grows to fill your vision and the sound in your ears becomes &lt;i&gt;everything.*&lt;/i&gt;
Feh! Fend for yourself then, twiggy. I&apos;ll take what I want after the Reds get to you, anyway.
*She winks at him.*
Yes, the needle did find you rather tough to chew. Then again I already knew I&apos;d have to push hard, knowing what you really are.
*Mention he seemed alright, but that could have just been a facade.*
Switching Party Members
*A wave of understanding passes over you. You realise that those creatures you&apos;ve been meeting in the fort are &apos;cured&apos; Sourcerers. People like you. You look at the High Judge in disgust.*
*Plead with the dwarves - you need their help.*
Our numbers dwindle. I am hardly fit to protect. I only hope to survive.
*Giggles* It is not so bad. I know which days have bread and which days have none. I know more bread comes some day. It helps.
*As she&apos;s dragged away to a tower, you hear her cursing Braccus Rex and his &apos;whore&apos;. Even when she&apos;s thrown inside and the door sealed, you can still hear her shouts.*
[SOLDIER] *Take a step forward and demand the creature stand down.*
Inclined to the arcane? I&apos;ve got you covered!
Shoes of the Sabbath
Can&apos;t change that now, I&apos;m afraid. No matter how much I want to. And &lt;i&gt;oh&lt;/i&gt;, do I want to.
*The spirit offers no resistance - she just stares at you mournfully, until she is gone.*
*The Watcher is notably quiet.*
Thank you for clearing that up, Susan.
*Unscrew the top of a healing potion, hold his head with your hand, and tilt its contents into his mouth.*
*The slime beast&apos;s gurgling takes on a more agitated tone.*
Anathema! It will be ours. The masses will tremble. Our enemies will bow before the demon blade!
Indeed not. But before you &apos;jump my bones&apos; as you people confusingly say, I would like to discuss something.
Nothing to be gained lollygagging around here. Better get moving.
I need more time!
Nimble Belt
There must... there must have been something. I failed them...
[VILLAIN] *Nod and observe that he&apos;d have even more gold coming his way if her father wasn&apos;t around.*
Ryker remained in his graveyard mansion, served by the spirits newly arrived there.
[SEBILLE] *Remark that if a lizard dies, she should have the courtesy to stay dead.*
I never thought I&apos;d follow him, not after Fort Joy - but he won over us veterans - Magister and Paladin alike. He&apos;s like a different man, now that he&apos;s found the path to Divinity.
*Tell her you expect the time of your life.*
(I&apos;m sorry, Geraldine. There&apos;s nothing I can do.) Hey you! So long as you know - this is total... BULL!
Look for ghosts at the destroyed caravan.
*The spirit of a hulking Black Ring warrior lurches right towards you, brandishing a spectral great axe.*
Find the giant spider.
*Tell the voice that you have no intention of being its &apos;vessel&apos;.*
*The spirit doesn&apos;t react still playing dead in his little death re-enactment. His performance abruptly ends, and he is gone.*
I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m... I can&apos;t see anything. I feel like a sheep in a wolf&apos;s den.
*She sighs impatiently as you hack up the last of the green smoke.*
Explode two random grenades or arrows in the inventories of every enemy in a target circle.
Take all the time you need!
Barely any of them even &lt;i&gt;tried&lt;/i&gt; to become the One through the Arenas.
*You stumble back, grasping at your face. Your eyes are fine, but the altar is changed, with a crescent moon hacked into the wood. As you leave, you can&apos;t shake the dull, thudding ache in your eye...*
Change the game&apos;s luminance. If the game feels too dark overall, increase this value.
Magister&apos;s Key
Portal
A Voidwoken - Fane&apos;s former assistant - asked him to use his Divinity to free the Eternals from the God King and return them to the world.
He was a man playing a game called divinity. And look where it brought us:
No. No, I suppose you don&apos;t look like a Magister. Those dogs don&apos;t leash their own - except for Alexandar himself as it happens.
I suppose that&apos;s a death sentence for Fort Joy. What a terrible shame.
Another one of &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt;. Anyway. I was serious before: I work for Griff, so don&apos;t try anything funny if you&apos;re heading inside.
Equally useful for felling trees and foes, this axe is the soldierly timberman&apos;s best companion.
From darkness, light.
It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; you! Don&apos;t hurt me! Help!
Magical Small Crossbow
*Across the cellar, a shape bearing &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;resemblance to a woman lurches around to face you. It utters a marrow-curdling gurgle.*
Well, there&apos;s a new one! &apos;Hawk of the High Seas,&apos; eh? I like it.
Silk Trousers
Shadowcloak Heartpiercer
Well chosen. I&apos;ve seen Duggan land a crossbow bolt right through the eye slit of a Magister helm - he should even the odds for you a little.
Wouldn&apos;t be a proper healer if I didn&apos;t. Go on; whaddya after?
*The face melts back into the wood of the door, and the whorls swirl back into a floral pattern. A loud metallic click can be heard from deep within.*
So. I can keep the gold?
Spiral Key
...and I&apos;ll pose the same question to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; as I did to the Voidwoken.
Change Encounter Name
Why are ye wastin&apos; everyone&apos;s time? Get to the site before the Empress sees!
The simplest thing in the world: become a god.
*She was a soldier of Lucian following orders. Just like you did. Leave her be.*
I will not stop you. If the Path of Blood accepted you, then so do I.
Enable edge panning
A useful tome explaining elemental interactions in Rivellon. Boom!
*Apologise, but you don&apos;t think you can do this.*
*The sails overhead billow outwards suddenly. The sun is blocked, momentarily casting the dragon figurehead into shadow.*
What&apos;s on your mind?
[1] lets you eat body parts to access the memories of the dead.
*Tell the spirit to cease what he&apos;s doing.*
*The dwarf breaks down in tears and turns away.*
Exactly that. We share common cause. If we work together, we can pull the thorn and throw it away.
or
Void-tainted Plaice
*Reach towards him so that your own index finger nearly touches his.*
Throw a projectile that deals [1].
An unexpected pleasure. For both of us, I&apos;m sure.
*The lizard hums loudly and happily - an unlikely rainbow in the greyest of places.*
Found the little corpse-related book I seek yet?
Ah, hello!
The day was lost, and no-one won. Divinity is still up for grabs. Will you be the one to grab it? I do so wonder.
Excellent work! I had my doubts about you, but I am happy to be proven wrong.
*A dying shark lies gasping on the sand, bleeding from the mouth and gills. It turns its dark and soulless eyes to you. Its bloody gills open in search of water but find only air.*
Do you think I&apos;m an idiot or are you just deluded? Your purse has more lint than gold.
It&apos;s just that... it&apos;s just that I wanted my things, my gold and my shirt, it&apos;s just that I don&apos;t know what I did wrong, it&apos;s just that we had a nice time...
*Tell her the demon is stronger than ever now; we need to find a way to get rid of it fast.*
*Notice the way the clasps and buckles on her outfit press into her caramel skin. Tell her she has your attention.*
I must speak with you, Red Prince. I must speak with you of Brahmos the Wanderer!
Perseverance
*The candles are still and lifeless, the souls within them gone forever.*
Ifan ben-Mezd
*The elf&apos;s skin is pale as a corpse&apos;s, but his face contorts with inscrutable emotion - joy, horror, and rapture flash over him like the changing surface of a pond.*
It&apos;s a city at a crossroads. Volumes could be written about a single conflict, yet Arx endures an infinitude at once.
Ksst! Go - get out! You are not welcome here. GO, she-pig!
Spirit of Baran Levere
How... how could he hide his true self from me?
Death of the Forests
Magister Waters
*Scoff that you have little interest in killing a raggedy creature like him.*
Well spotted, genius.
