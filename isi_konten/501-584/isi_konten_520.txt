So, Lohse: Here we are. The Nameless Isle. I imagine the demon inside you is all a-flutter with excitement.
*Give him the money.*
Every Mother&apos;s Nightmare
*Let every one wash through you. They are yours.*
Did Kemm write this, do you suppose? Or did he just confiscate it from someone else?
Power of Innocence Ambient B
My prince! With your every step toward me, my heart beats more happily!
*Say that it was really &lt;i&gt;Han&lt;/i&gt; who helped &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, truth be told.*
Oh, you know. This and that... and she mentioned that the thing in my head is probably a demon. Told me there&apos;s a fella not so far from where we&apos;re headed who might be able to help me with it, too.
Talk to Murga.
One last decision remained: the fate of Divinity and of the world. My companions disputed my claim. We fought. I lost.
*The dwarf rubs his temples, his rings glittering rose-gold in the light.*
A heap of finely-powdered bone dust. If you listen closely, you could swear it whispers tragic tales of its origin. You stuff it deeper into your backpack. Nobody wants to hear that.
Good to know. And likewise... with whatever &lt;i&gt;errands&lt;/i&gt; of your own you have.
*You&apos;ll never speak again. Never sing again. No-one knows you. No-one ever will.*
*Demons are such vile creatures after all... Say that he&apos;s right: you&apos;ll reconsider.*
We gave the dwarf queen&apos;s letter to Lohar. Our business is done.
Shelf
*Later. The ship lurches as the Magisters laugh and take your spores. They think you are that easily parted, that this cell will keep you. But the spores whisper even now - they will protect you.*
*Let him keep it.*
*He runs his knife through another fish and flicks the blade, sending a shower of guts to the ground.*
[LIZARD] *Scoff and say that you&apos;d die of shame before letting some human injure you - you&apos;re fine.*
*Beast&apos;s lips twitch and his eyes glimmer.*
I figured it was only a matter of time. I... I&apos;m ready to pay the price.
*Tell him there simply have to be easier ways to meet!*
And you, of course, assured it! I cannot thank you enough, O brave soul! The Ancient Empire is in your debt!
You&apos;ll need to find her and take back what she stole. And quickly - before she does something irreversible.
So delicious, yet so pathetic. Braccus Rex conducted a masterwork of torture here. With a single gesture, he could raze an army.
My prince! With your every step toward me, my heart beats more happily!
You are supremely important - moreso than any loved one, any companion. Do not forget that.
Mystical Giant Venom Rune
Max Damage
*Leave the statue be.*
*Grin and say that you don&apos;t actually have the ability to consume the Source of spirits, but thank him for the information all the same.*
*Close your eyes and feel the breeze on your face. Yes, you feel it. Death on the wind, yet something... sweet, too.*
*Say that your head feels like it&apos;s going to split open, and your mouth tastes of ashes.*
But some elves disagreed, and plotted against her.
Marg&apos;s Monopoly
Take that, Sourcerer! Dallis, get her!
Poor thing. She needs nourishment. A lady can&apos;t live on tea alone.
*The little girl faces the sun, her eyes closed. She basks in its glow, savouring it with a little smile.*
Still, I do appreciate the sentiment.
Carruthers -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I trust you were briefed, but a reminder - you are to deliver the spore to the Blackpits camp. Note that weâ€™ve received word that its original owner has escaped from Fort Joy. Take appropriate caution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucian guide you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gershwin
*Say that it&apos;s good to hear he&apos;s taken such a liking to a life on the road.*
Purged Hound
You think I stopped to get a name?
Electric Discharge Skillbook
It was? I mean - it was! Of course it was.
*The knight sighs heavily, staring down at his broken body.*
*The ship creaks beneath you. Somewhere on board, there must be a way to get it moving.*
The Ultimate Guide to Noxious Bulbs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noxious bulbs grow in the temperate regions of Rivellon. They thrive in open areas, where their intricate root systems can freely grow.&lt;br&gt;Commonly used as a means of security, noxious bulbs are well known for their vivid colours and their equally vivid defence mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;Once they are fully grown, they appear in a multitude of variations. The effects of the bulbs roughly match their appearance as well as the element to which the bulb is most susceptible. &lt;br&gt;For instance, a red noxious fire bulb is susceptible to fire, and a yellow noxious earth bulb is susceptible to earthen elements.&lt;br&gt; They are very sturdy flowers that are hard to destroy or uproot, but if one does manage to destroy them,&lt;br&gt;they will hardly go down without a boom.
Explore Gall&apos;s laboratory.
No, no! Wait, please! Please...!
*Ask him what to expect beyond the bridge.*
How romantic a concession, to let a woman kill when she so pleases.
Annoying creature! Leash it before I lash it!
*You feel his pain as he tries to resist. His thoughts pass before you - into you - as he fights the inevitable; &apos;you bastard you traitor you liar you dark evil monster you monster &lt;i&gt;you monster YOU MONSTER - &apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*GRUH!*
*You bow to Alexandar as Gareth had said you must. You rise, and the bishop&apos;s sceptre points directly at you. &apos;Show me.&apos; He is the master; you are the obedient hound. And he wants to see your tricks.*
Nooo!
You set right the original wrong.
I should&apos;ve known there&apos;d be trouble!
Power will be shared among the evil and the good. The light and the dark. The sky and the earth. They will enjoy equal Sourcelight, yes. But they will not &lt;i&gt;be equal.&lt;/i&gt;
None t-t-t-AWKAWK-en.
&lt;i&gt;*Growl...*&lt;/i&gt;

Bottle of Swirling Mud
If you have one to spare, I sure would appreciate it.
*Say you&apos;ve heard rumours that someone within this tavern might be responsible for a recent string of Magister disappearances.*
An extra layer of protection for the Princess. The arena was fashioned after one in our homeland, but the opponents you faced were conjured up by your unconscious mind.
Smart lass.
*The chest still won&apos;t open.*
Glowing Amulet
&lt;br&gt;[1] [2]&lt;br&gt;
*The dwarf flushes red with indignation.*
*He nods a greeting.*
&lt;i&gt;Walk away...&lt;/i&gt;
*You remember reading a book that mentioned this place.*
Quite so. But let&apos;s not discuss the Change just yet. Stingtail stung too soon. Right now we must ensure your safety. Should you perish, the Change perishes with it.
My Queen: the specimen before you is a Godwoken - a claimant to the divine throne.
It *was* you! Don&apos;t hurt me! Help!
What in the hell do you think you&apos;re doing? Leave the poor girl in peace!
Still here? Don&apos;t you have a Soul Jar to find, sweetness?
Geraldine
*You can feel the God King&apos;s deep delight. You&apos;re sure you hear him laughing.*
*Declare that the tavern cook was behind the disappearances - the missing Magisters died at her hands.*
*Ask for subtlety - someone who can pick a pocket unseen, retreat to the shadows and perhaps throw a spell or two. A Shadowblade would do.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82] gold)
*Prod her in the shoulder to get her attention.*
*The creature looks down at him and shrieks in rage. Her gestures are quick, strong, and violent. Whatever she said, it seems to have devastated your friend.*
*Tell her you&apos;re so grateful to be free.*
Ehh. Can we talk about this later? Like... when I&apos;m not stuck behind bars?
Fah! There&apos;s no way off. There better be enough wood in that stump to make a ladder.
No... &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;b&gt;NO!&lt;/b&gt;
[FANE] *Tell her not to be attracted by the lies of the God King.*
*Sarcastically remark it&apos;s been an absolutely lovely journey downward. Now will he please get to the point?*
Alright. I&apos;ll go unarmed, on your word.
*Ask her to tell you more about Braccus.*
And why hasn&apos;t Alexandar risen yet?
*She pushes you back and starts unbuttoning your clothes. You help her out of her tattered dress and soon you&apos;re in each other&apos;s arms again, naked.*
We have been cursed with eternal life. It would be cruel not to give you the relief of death.
Bird &amp; Wind Forest 07
Human Axe
Now go, Godwoken. Go with my blessing. Let it remind you always of who you are: &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; crusader.
*He smiles at the thought of it.*
Black-Haired Boy
He visited us here, without warning. Highly unorthodox of course, but naturally we invited him in, and threw a feast in his honour.
Maybe &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;don&apos;t.
*Take a defensive stance and prepare to fight her.*
&lt;i&gt;Me miserable!&lt;/i&gt;
Divine Talents
*The dwarf grimaces, and points the tip of his knife at his handiwork.*
Alright. Look. Just get out of Arx. Leave it far behind and never turn back. I can&apos;t say why... but trust me. Do it.
*The power recoils from your attack - it clearly didn&apos;t expect resistance. But it has too much control over too many minds: try as you might, you can&apos;t break its influence.*
You dare enter a combat with &lt;i&gt;gods?&lt;/i&gt; You overstep your bounds...
You pray not at my shrines? Can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, my most wayward cub.
*The bond of your friendship is stronger than ever, but you realise you&apos;ll never have the chance now of getting to know her more intimately.*
Demonic Pincer
Another Sourcerer on the loose! I knew they should&apos;ve cut off the Meistr&apos;s head and burned the rest. Gotta make sure it don&apos;t grow back...
Perhaps I can detonate that explosive from a distance.
Eeeeee... I... I mean... Eeeeee... Aw hells - forget it.
I wonder if I&apos;ve made a mistake in you...
Ask. I am here to serve in all ways.
Cautious
[OUTLAW] *Note her fearful behavior. What&apos;s got her so jumpy?*
I made it. And I can scarcely believe it.&lt;br&gt;br&gt;I&apos;d chronicle my adventures - and there are stories worth telling - but I will wait until my promised comes. Thoughts of what might be have eased my worry and pain since I fled Fort Joy. That is when I will share my story. And that is who I will share my story with.
You feel it don&apos;t you, Sebille. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are now the heart.
Globe
The time for thinking is over.
Devourer&apos;s Mark
You got it, kid.
Onion
Lying scum! There is no salvation but salvation through our master, and he would see you rot in this mire.
Come, let me take a look at you. I&apos;ve never known a god before they became divine. I was curious if it would have changed you.
Smasher
*Justinia struggles to control her rage. She closes her eyes; she breathes the sewer&apos;s fetid air. She waits.*
Garlic
I am pleased to hear it. For there are others in the world: &apos;Godwoken.&apos; The mortal champions chosen by the others.
Driftwood teetered on the edge of starvation, until the night the Voidwoken came from the sea. All were killed. This did, however, put an end to the famine.
This is a foul place, full of foul play. We must stay on our toes.
*Tell him it sounds like he struck it lucky.*
Hardly - she&apos;s just some deckhand. If it were up to me, I&apos;d tie her to the main mast and use her for arrow practice... but Malady wants her alive for now.
A visitor. Such a rare and... &lt;i&gt;exquisite&lt;/i&gt; pleasure.
Grrrrrrrrrrrr...!
*Tell him you do indeed seek Roost.*
*You sink to your knees.*
A wonderful place for you to go in search of.
Let&apos;s proceed.
*Admit it was somewhat vague on that point.*
*Say there&apos;s nothing you can&apos;t stand.*
[LIZARD] *Remark that you feel lucky to have found a little piece of home in the form of this enslaved ship. It will obey you from now on.*
Captain Sech Zapor. Slaver of the Seas. Servant of the Source King.
