*Say you&apos;re already certain history will repeat itself...*
You should just give up now. Nothing will stop Dallis&apos; holy mission.
Discipline. That&apos;s all he needs. Discipline and the flesh of the recently deceased.
*Note that the Sourcerer may be dead already.*
Summon gains increased Physical Resistance and Armour. Also grants Grasp of the Starved and an additional Necromancer skill (depending on summon).
*You hum in unison; your voices blend, become one with the breath of the forest.*
*You try to calm your breathing but your ragged pulse has other ideas. All you can see is the devastation of the Deathfog... the rise of the Voidwoken... the desolation of Rivellon today...*
[MYSTIC] *Bow your head and offer a prayer for this hapless woman.*
*Ask what has him in such a foul mood.*
Greetings, friend, and may your future be as bright as the Moonglade&apos;s dawn.&lt;br&gt;
*Thwarted in its attempts to eat, the spirit of the rat lets out a screech of frustration.*
The &lt;i&gt;what...?&lt;/i&gt;
For my protection, miss. And for your protection. And for the protection of all the realm! Don&apos;t you see that?
You die for making a dirty offer like that!
The team loses the match when this character dies. King has extra vitality and 1 AP per turn.

*Mention you had dropped your lantern a few moments ago. That must have been it.*
Mmm, best thonkle. You saved us just in - *HNR!* - time.
A crate? I can&apos;t think about a &lt;i&gt;crate &lt;/i&gt;now. My baby is missing!
Jet Black

*Ask him to tell you again exactly what you&apos;re looking for.*
*The two other undead roar with laughter.*
*He thinks for a moment on this. Then a glint appears in his eye that makes you think he&apos;s... smiling.*
Chainmail boots for stomping around in. You won&apos;t be quiet, but at least you won&apos;t stub your toes.
*Scoff and say he&apos;s delirious. You&apos;ve no idea what he is talking about.*
Please take my blessing with you.
*Reach for your weapon.*
*He looks you over, his mouth pressed into a mirthless smirk.*
Tight Ring
That&apos;s the dumbest excuse I&apos;ve ever heard. Come on, then. You&apos;re under arrest.
Warp Infusion Scroll
Just make it quick...
Look it, look it, look it this. &lt;i&gt;This.&lt;/i&gt; Ss. This is my story.
You can stay out here with me if you want. You don&apos;t seem that scary.
Here is the truth, Ifan. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; Lucian&apos;s son. And I will take &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;actions necessary, for the good of all. Nothing can stop me becoming the next Divine.
You can go first.
[UNDEAD] *Remark that he doesn&apos;t seem all that alarmed to find himself facing an undead.*
Giant Fire Beetle
*Tell her you met Roost. Relay everything he told you - about Saheila and hunting of the Scions.*
Sebille! It gives me joy to see you. You continue to become the great Scion. This is good. For we stand on the edge of the abyss. Are you prepared for the coming war?
I feared we may have produced conflicting data, requiring further testing, but this is quite adequate.
I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like you, for instance.
Well, I&apos;m a rat. And you&apos;re some kind of... hm... stubby, stubbly, thick-sized squash-human. Never the twain shall mix, thus spaketh the reddish large-style flesh-beasts!
*Give her a little shove. Come on, time to get going.*
What? &lt;i&gt;Eaten?&lt;/i&gt; But who would do such a thing...? A black day this is... a deep, dark day...
*Squish* *Squish*
Spirit of Taryan Graye
*Ignore the jab and ask what&apos;s going on here.*
*The object repeats its unintelligible remarks from earlier, but says nothing more.*

*Ask how he became trapped here.*
Large Venom Rune Of Power
*Tell him you&apos;re not sure Gareth is that hero anymore.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast without investigating further.
Mr Baum,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regretfully, the Arx Consulate cannot offer you a trading visa for passage to the Ancient Empire at this time. We are unable to ensure safe passage to and from the Empire in the current climate. Should you wish to set up your stall just outside the gates of the Empire, you are most welcome to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should you have any further questions, please hesitate before asking. We are rather busy.
*Ifan nods his thanks. He turns away just as you see the emotion rising in his eyes. Then, the coiled spring snaps, and he pounces upon Lucian like savagery incarnate.*
Interior Upstairs 01
*Hand over Garvan&apos;s head.*
Surely not. Surely, you are a &lt;i&gt;sophisticated&lt;/i&gt; ally in the battle against the Voidwoken?
Go on then. And don&apos;t make me regret this!
[LOHSE] *Tell her there&apos;s no point in holding on to the past. What&apos;s done is done, what&apos;s gone is gone.*
I&apos;ll teach you to go messing with other people&apos;s stuff!
We gave a potion to Geraldine the cow. She turned back into a man and marked a hidden cache on our map.
*Say that you&apos;ll be back as soon as possible.*
*In its wake, ashes fall from the ceiling. Oppressive heat presses in as a low growl rumbles against your ear.*
Yes... Yes, quite fascinating. A barrier of pure Source... Do you truly think this &apos;veil&apos; is the key to unlocking a new future?
*Tell her that if that&apos;s how she feels, she&apos;s welcome to leave.*
Driftwood Prison
Looks like you&apos;re clean. Good thing, too.
Alas, we&apos;ve seen them tumble from their tower...
In Driftwood, we came upon an abandoned house.
*Say you&apos;re just glad to see all that trouble behind you rather than in front of you.*
*The spirit is strangely still and inscrutable - numb from unimaginable tragedy.*
Hold it there! You&apos;ve been seen using Source! Looks like you&apos;ll be cooling off in prison.
*Nod. That&apos;s right.*
Oh how kiiiiiind. But I don&apos;t liiiike butter. You could try carrot juuuuuuice, or some kind of nnnnnn...
Poison Wave Skillbook
Raise Skeleton Archer
White Magister Reimond was here with his cabal as the fighting began. If we find him, we will find Dallis!
&lt;b&gt;Aetera, Aetera. I had hoped to see you turn to dust in this tomb. Alone, forgotten, with only your secrets for comfort.&lt;/b&gt;
Leather Helmet
You make quite the mess! Come on then. I&apos;ve got a prison cell ready for you.
*The fawn&apos;s breathing is shallow and ragged.*
With the full book, we know we can summon Duna&apos;s Undertaker with Source-infused mutton and appease it with a specific ritual
*Leave him be.*
There&apos;s drudanae growing in this yarrow...
Summons will not be able to attack you
Depending on one&apos;s definition of &apos;survivor&apos;, of course...
Please do.
*Move the blue lever.*
G&apos;head. She&apos;s with the body.
Demon Caster Attack
Metal Door
*Tell her the chips will fall where they&apos;ll fall.*
Radius
*Tell the pinkie she can bugger off.*
*Ask him how he got separated from his mother.*
For the refined oenophile.
My good, wonderrrrful, exquisite man&apos;s man. You bring drudanae, yes?
I have seen the truth, child. I have watched you pass through the Fort and into these swamps. But beware of your companions, they are more dangerous than they seem.
*Call to her: Lohse, come back. We aren&apos;t done here. Not yet.*
You must be kidding.
*Ask if he shouldn&apos;t be doing the same. The ship is going down!*
For choosing the next Divine, you mean?
Alien Fire Essence
Bring it on, Dallis. Bring it on.
*He halts, looking you in the eye. As he lowers his weapon, he smiles a shrewd smile, all teeth and promise.*
Seeking to purge Source on a massive scale, Dallis resurrected and enslaved Braccus Rex. But ‘Vredeman’ was tempted by the God King...
I kill the Beast... I eat his flesh...
I&apos;ve got questions for him. And he&apos;d better have answers. Or his second death will be even more painful than the first.
Skip Video
These are difficult times. A mercenary like you might not understand, but sacrifices must be made for the greater good.
*Then the machine winds down. The cistern is empty. All is silent.*
We &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;stop him. This cannot continue. We can&apos;t let it. We need to free them - snuff them out. If Adramahlihk can&apos;t draw on their power, we&apos;ll be able to face him and finish him.
His voice was everywhere. It danced with the screams...
There&apos;s... triplets in my mind. The woman I am. The woman I must be. The woman I long to be.
*You bow and she places her right hand on your head as a sign of acceptance and benevolence.*
Your will is strong. I applaud that! But know I shall find you again, and again.
Trader&apos;s Tongue
...
Woof!
*Note that Braccus was vanquished long ago - he won&apos;t be lifting any curses in the near future...*
Sebille is the Prime Scion. The warrior Tovah urged her to travel to the Nameless Isle and find the Mother Tree.
Pity. Well, later then.
Graved god, will you quit draggin&apos; this on? T&apos;ain&apos;t that hard, legsy. Just hand over the gold.
Raw Mutton
Just say the word and I&apos;ll summon a flood large enough to end this - all of this - once and for all.
Hasty Manoeuvres
Not that this comes as any surprise. Just look at this place...
Move Camera Left
After the Voidwoken first attacked our city, Lord Kemm investigated and put two and two together. It all makes sense now. To think they blamed all Sourcerers! The only question remaining is... why?

Looks like I catch me the thief I am looking for!
Got no patience for vandals here. You&apos;re under arrest!
*Smirk and say you&apos;d like to see what he&apos;s hiding under his armour.*
*You see a glimmer of hope flicker across Slane&apos;s eyes as he notices your approach. It&apos;s quickly doused with the practiced scowl of the oft disappointed.*
*Ask what she has for sale.*
A firm note written in a firm hand.
Oh - pardon. I wasn&apos;t aware of your training. Please, do what you must. I will leave you to it.
Ladder
Whenever we are ready to leave Reaper&apos;s Eye, we should talk to Malady.
You... you have merely delayed the inevitable. The Deathfog will be a slow death now, severing our trade route with the world.

*Say that her necklace is almost as sparkling as her eyes.*
*Raise a hand as if to strike her and tell her to calm down.*
*He looks up and you see that his jaw is cracked, broken, and falling to pieces. Fissures are starting to run across his skull, and his ribs start to snap and fall one by one.*
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;know Gill?
Because the God King is our &lt;i&gt;true lord and saviour&lt;/i&gt; - he&apos;s going to right the wrongs of the Seven. If you want to be a part of his new world, you had better be ready to prove yourself.
&lt;b&gt;...and break you.&lt;/b&gt;
*The four deer suddenly fall silent and stand stock-still.*
You watch that friend o&apos; yours. Scallawag flicked some fairy dust my way naught but a moment ago. No tellin&apos; what effects it&apos;ll have on me...
*Her form melts away to smoke, leaving nothing but a platform bathed in light from a huge, bright moon.*
*Gareth grunts and returns to his frenzied search.*
Again, I say: stow your weapons!
*Turn towards the statue. Did he say Braccus was responsible for his curse?*
*The warg snarls and growls at&lt;i&gt; you.*&lt;/i&gt;
Gods... that thing! There&apos;s no time!
*He won&apos;t be waiting long. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
A precious find indeed. I shall preserve it. After all, its taste would be wasted on me...
Dallis and that pet of hers are a force to be reckoned with. There is... more to them than meets the eye.
*Ask him what his breakthrough was.*
The Empress was the Devourer&apos;s first champion. She laid the path for those who would follow.
