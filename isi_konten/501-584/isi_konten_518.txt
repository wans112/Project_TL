Erase
*The transparent artefact glimmers of its own accord, as if conducting light from another world, another plane of living. As your hand nears it, it shivers... and &lt;i&gt;speaks.*&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;ll live ashamed til the end of my days. And I&apos;ll take to sea no more. I lost my compass and lost myself.
Alexandar is alive! He&apos;s belowdecks on the Lady Vengeance. He&apos;ll wake from his coma to questions...
Let me out. Please!
*You&apos;ve heard enough. The Voidwoken dies.*
*Say nothing.*
Creg sure knows how to carry a tune. The only talent I&apos;ve got is selling high-priced trinkets to gullli... I mean, to fine, upstanding customers like yourself!
*You lean in to examine the images further, but are driven back by the intense heat of the flames.*
*Stand firm. He can&apos;t speak to it.*
*Shrug, and casually let the jar fall to the floor, where is shatters.*
I cannot say whether the future brings peace or pain. But I am bidden to serve you, as promised once, and promised eternal. And so, as always...
Voidwoken must&apos;ve sensed &apos;em. Came in formation, like a proper battalion. Never seen anything like it.
You should know we are nothing without our people. Now more than ever. So?
A glowing lock? I guess we&apos;re looking for a magical key, then?
Authority issues? Such a pity. You could have been so &lt;i&gt;useful.&lt;/i&gt;
It is time then. Time to face him. I am ready for his gift, and his sanction.
I&apos;m... happy. How unbecoming.
*Admit they were somewhat vague on that point.*
She was right. She has a way of speaking to you that makes you need to do whatever she asks. Turned out the Aeteran was no stranger to death.
*sigh* Those were the days. But through it all I&apos;ve been what you might know as... a wizard. All these long years I have worked to maintain balance in the world. Lately that has seen me at the service of Lucian.
He complained to his missus.
Medical Cabinet
Listen. We&apos;re both busy people. Why don&apos;t you get busy somewhere else, while I stay busy here?
*Remember the Master of the House of Shadows and shudder. Tell the priest amazing things are happening at the temple...*
Only a Godwoken, descended from heroes, may ascend to Divinity. But few are left. We knew of one - Verdas. He is why we came here...
You noticed that, huh? Well, I&apos;m a lot of things, but &apos;subtle&apos; ain&apos;t one of &apos;em.
*It looks haggard and weak, its very voice but a feeble echo of your own.*
We boarded the Lady Vengeance. The Seekers are in charge, so we&apos;re among friends. But what now?
Farewell, ben-Mezd. I hope you don&apos;t disappoint.
Yes. Word of the great champion has already reached my ears, courtesy of Barstan Tungs, the esteemed bard. Now, Isbeil - is there more you wish to share?
*Tell her she&apos;s making a racket and to be silent.*
Really...? &lt;i&gt;Really?!&lt;/i&gt; Better off alone than with- oh very well.
*Say you think so.*
*As you take in its chiselled details, you a have a vision. The statue comes to life and embraces you awkwardly with its broken arms. Unable to resist, you&apos;re flown away into an endless dark.*
*Beast hums a slow tune as you near and holds his fingernails up to examine them. He does not wish to chat.*
*Ask her to remind you of the items she&apos;s interested in.*
This is why they grow armour from the vines, do you see? To protect me.
ROLL RESULT
The farce ends now. You&apos;ve riled the beast. And the only cure for the affliction... is &lt;i&gt;blood.&lt;/i&gt;
[HUMAN] *Sing a song of humanity&apos;s great generals. Perhaps the statue will respond.*
The sun shines brighter now that Gareth is returned! I only wish Duggan could have been here to bask in it...
The Shadow Prince sang Sebille&apos;s scar-song. She belongs to him once more.
Skull Sentinel
We found a laboratory hidden in the sewers beneath Arx.
I haven&apos;t the time or inclination to sort it out who&apos;s righteous and who&apos;s a renegade. All I care about is doing what&apos;s best for the realm.
Excellent, excellent. But perhaps you would be interested in earning some coin?

The Seven? You misunderstand. Let the others rot, hanged like rabbits from a brace.

Grace
Is that so? I must say you surprise me. But then again I always suspected a bit of the poet behind potentate; the sentimentalist behind the strategist.
The Spirit of the Tree of Ghalann
*Ask him to dance.*
Is there more? Speak up.
*Ask just what these &apos;Shriekers&apos; are.*
I remember you. I like you. You&apos;re fun.
Stop it, will you?
Savages. That&apos;s all these people are.
No bribes. Only justice.
*Say you&apos;d like entry.*
Wood Totem
Move along, please! The Cathedral is safe. Move along!
Shhh.
It is. But I chose you because I knew you could bear it. I am not mistaken.
The blacksmith might remove the Source collar of the &lt;i&gt;new champion of Fort Joy.&lt;/i&gt;
*Mention that you&apos;ve had dealings with his kind before - Grog was his name - can&apos;t he just trust you and let you pass?*
Though I must admit these fellows are rather tenacious. Do you tire of their attempts?&lt;br&gt;
Energy Chest
Would you be a dear and retrieve it for me?
Hm.
&lt;i&gt;I seeee yooou.&lt;/i&gt;
However her life began, it ended well. No-one should be damned because of their youth.
A security logbook explaining recent trap activities in the cellar.
We met Ryker. He offered to teach us the ways of Source, but only if we helped him first.

*Say you&apos;ve seen demons in the flesh, so you well believe it.*
*Wonder what he&apos;s so afraid of.*
*Thank her for her warning and return to other matters.*
*The man gazes at your face for so long that you feel compelled to turn away.*
Huh. I want another beer and a bowl of stew, and I reckon I have a better chance than you do. Go on then, clear off.
*Tell him you want all of his earnings. And he can be glad that&apos;s all you&apos;re asking.*
You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; being honoured - with something quite exceptional:
&lt;b&gt;You could have joined us. You could have saved yourselves. If only you had bowed. You could have made fine subjects.&lt;/b&gt;
*Well  what does he expect, living a life of crime? He was always going to come to a bad end.*
*Laugh and say you can hardly tell a turkey from a turnip.*
*Sschrrrick.*
*He winces and recoils, then quickly regains his composure.*
The Red Princess is the secret of my soul. There is no doubt we are meant for one another; meant for dragons.
Speak with Sanders the Toymaker.
*The whites of Lohse&apos;s eyes fade to grey, then black. The colour runs into her veins, criss-crossing her skin like lightning. She keeps hold of Saheila&apos;s hands.*
Don&apos;t be castin&apos; yer short shadow around here, missus. This here land&apos;s not fer your kind.
It is awful how she treats you. She asks so much, and gives so little in return...
If Arx falls, so do the Magisters. I&apos;m willing to accept the losses.
Lohse... good, you made it. This would have all been for nothing if we didn&apos;t come away with a Godwoken. Now we just have to get this damn ship moving...
Some places need rebuilt. Others... others need destroyed.
*Dizziness. It lasts just a moment - but long enough for you to feel your God&apos;s presence. You hear no words, yet understand: it&apos;s imperative you accept Ryker&apos;s bargain.*
&apos;In honour of Duna, patron of the dwarves. Long may their mountain halls stand as a testament to him.&apos;
That I am... I can hardly believe it. &lt;i&gt;Thank you&lt;/i&gt;.
[LIZARD] *Few kin would roam among human graves. Ask what she&apos;s doing here.*
Good thing you had &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; for that fight out there, bud. I&apos;ll not be lettin&apos; you forget it anytime soon...
*Motion to the destruction around you. What&apos;s going on here? What has he seen?*
&lt;i&gt;...you are not enough... you were never enough...&lt;/i&gt;
The Feats of the Four&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behold the mighty heroes of Driftwood, and the feats for which we owe them our thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garrick, a human, who slew the necromancers preying upon the dead of the Stonegarden.&lt;br&gt;Bromley, a dwarf, who defeated the demons that plagued the great woodlands.&lt;br&gt;Vydia, a lizard, who subdued the strange beasts that arose from the primordial caverns east of Driftwood.&lt;br&gt;Halla, an elf, who defended the farmers who feed Driftwood against pitiless bandits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are immortal through their deeds. Their implements of victory shall rest where they slew their enemies.
Couldn&apos;t finish what you started, ey? *Spits.* Coward.

We found Lord Withermoore&apos;s Soul Jar. What shall we do with it?
Dice Rolls
*Scoff. He&apos;s facing down an impossible task.*
We... we don&apos;t have anything to give, sir. But... Gwydian&apos;s studied with that Hannag woman. He can probably teach you something...
Lucian told me to express myself, so I did. I showed those Seekers &lt;i&gt;exactly &lt;/i&gt;what I could do. Seekers might be faithful, but they sure as hell aren&apos;t &lt;i&gt;smart.&lt;/i&gt;
Beast took great offence to my execution of Justinia&apos;s plan, and left the party.
You&apos;re a human, like me! That means we&apos;re friends already. My mum told me not to make friends with lizards and elves and dwarves and stuff. But&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;think they&apos;re ok.
I have what I came for, thanks to you! Nothing like a bit of honour among thieves to brighten one&apos;s day!
*Say that you&apos;re glad to hear that, and take your leave.*
I noticed a familiarity in the thing that possesses you from the moment we met. What I hunt and what you seek to be rid of are one and the same.
Something doesn&apos;t feel right about this place...

*You extinguished the candle. The light is out.*
There she is. The selfish old sow.
Troll Droppings
Dual wielding penalty: [1]%
This is what I deserve. My fate&apos;s been sealed ever since I didn&apos;t help those elves. I could&apos;ve saved some, but I didn&apos;t.
Finally. Let&apos;s go. We&apos;re heading to a place called the Nameless Isle - though &apos;place&apos; is perhaps a &lt;i&gt;simple &lt;/i&gt;word for it.
*The elves then wrench the spear and twist the blade three times, in practiced motion. Blood flows to the ground, and Sarias&apos;s heart lies open, neatly cut in four.*
Oh no, not at all. I use only use the smallest sprinkle of Source in my work - I&apos;d hardly think a &lt;i&gt;Voidwoken &lt;/i&gt;would set its sights on me and my darlings...
*Take your leave.*
After the longest of lifetimes, the Eternal Fane is dead and gone.
Dangerous Land
Eh. We could let them live, but I&apos;m just in one of those moods.
Then you haven&apos;t met them...
We used the power of Divinity to banish the Source from the world.
Take a hike, I&apos;m busy.
Hmm?
*Tell Exter the path is clear. The Shriekers have already been destroyed.*
Agree to free Lord Withermoore&apos;s spirit and he&apos;ll show us a way out of Fort Joy.
Thanks again, for the help. Stay safe.
Do you hear that? Something&apos;s up ahead...
I&apos;m so very *yawn* sleepy...
*Holy... How are they doing &lt;i&gt;that?&lt;/i&gt; You wonder if...*
Well... Nice knowing you.
Hold me close, my love, and bask in my divinity.
I&apos;d love to talk about the two of us.
I heard ya once rode a serpent to a sea-city, heedin&apos; a mermaid choir&apos;s melody. An&apos; that they begged for the Beast of their dreams to make love to &apos;em all twice over! Tell me fer true.
Cat
Not still scared of Griff, are ya? Don&apos;t worry; his bark&apos;s not half as bad as his bite.
We are &lt;i&gt;free!&lt;/i&gt;
The vulture&apos;s feathers were a blessing. Your theft has cursed them! Your prize - ruined!
