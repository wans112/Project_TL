Now I&apos;m seeking things you could never find for me: rituals to awaken as an Undead again. True death only re-kindled my desire to be alive.
*The dwarf presses a forefinger against her lips and lets out a shush.*
*Smile and say you would have never pegged him for a romantic.*
Ribs
FNUD!
*Note that he seems a little tense...*
At least the barbarians - no offence to you, my well-odoured friend - were unable to club their way into my vault. Everything you need should be safe.
Guess when bones start talkin&apos;, it&apos;s better to leave. But next thing I know, I&apos;m a soul chained up to a pair o&apos; shoes.
*Ryker&apos;s mouth opens wide, emitting not sound, but tendrils of Source that snake into you, pumping memories into you faster than you can interpret them.*
But perhaps we could agree a trade? Your life for my death. Destroy my soul jar, so I might join my brethern in the afterlife.
Sing the song when I signal you. And wish me good luck.
He comes. You&apos;ll see.
The stew at the Black Bull is made from Magisters.
*Tell her she knows she can&apos;t be trusted with that much power. The demon would corrupt her - it just isn&apos;t safe.*
Lid
Keep your distance.
The Beast of the Sea returned to the dwarven kingdom, this time as a lawmaker.
Swamp Golem
|[1] grants a boost when you inflict a finishing blow on your enemy. This boost gains power based on the amount of excessive damage dealt.|
I know. It&apos;s really... hah. &lt;i&gt;Special&lt;/i&gt;.
Marked and stamped with all the requisite fussery of the Divine Order, this piece of paper is a writ of passage for Driftwood.
*Nod and ask the guard to remind you who &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;is.*
[VILLAIN] *Smile and explain that you&apos;re here to have some fun.*
Beware of gods bearing gifts.
After he interred me in this cell, he must have drawn my very soul away from me and stored it elsewhere in the fort. Thus he has bound me entirely to the mundane realm.
You would think to lecture &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; on madness?
Add-Ons
*The being sniffs the air in your direction, and licks his lips. He moves a couple of paces towards you, his eyes hungry and entranced. He abruptly &lt;i&gt;SLAPS &lt;/i&gt;himself in the face, and halts his advance.*
Well, that was easier than I thought! And I&apos;ll do my best to stay... myself. Lead the way!
I remember the big things, of course. My library. My home. My King. My family.
Dead Gheist
Quite so. Even for a human, you have an unwavering talent for violence.
*...its spectral fingers now restored. There&apos;s a glimmer of what might be a ring on one of them. She vanishes.*
Time for a real challenge - name the first king of the dwarves.
Elf Herbalist
I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t do that.
Plains - Quiet Road C
*Tell her you&apos;re not into their weird cult.*
*He tilts his head sideways, doubt apparent on his screwed-up face.*
Isbeil - hush yourself! I must think...
Thanks for your &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell her to remove the armour. It&apos;s addled her mind.*
Origin Info
Stay strong, my love. We&apos;ll find a way out of this.
The Divine is dead. The Bishop is all we have left.
Buyin&apos; or sellin&apos;?
Combat Backstab
*Hide your own memories of Alexandar (and Borris too) and allow hers to continue...*
*Drape your arms around his neck. &apos;Lovers.&apos; The term he&apos;s looking for is &apos;Lovers.&apos;*
Where to start...
Divinity &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be mine, Ifan. Keep that in mind...It can&apos;t be any other way.
*It could be worse. At least you&apos;re not Silent Monks.*
The lizards who ambushed us did not belong to the House of Shadows. Sadha has gone, and I have not the least idea where. I&apos;m at a loss.
And as you see, they need &lt;i&gt;a lot &lt;/i&gt;of work.
We must hurt you if you hurt us, Lohse. It is the only way to wake you up. Do you hear me? Please - you must subdue - hurt her to save her! It&apos;s the only way!
*Smile grimly. This is where he draws his power. This is how you&apos;ll stop him - forever.*
I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;re too young to remember what Lucian did to the Black Ring. To the elves. These are different times. Death ain&apos;t something you do alone in your bed anymore.
*It is the cathedral of Arx! You recognise it from paintings that hang in your palace.*
Ouch... &lt;i&gt;Ouch!&lt;/i&gt;
A secret vault! What else are they hiding?
*Retrieve Lohar&apos;s head from your backpack and place it on the table.*
She was part of the Order. Knew Alexandar personally. Alexandar &lt;i&gt;trusted &lt;/i&gt;her, at least as far as you can trust a... you know... one of you. Anyway, to repay that trust, the Meistr gave Alexandar up to his enemies.
Crispin the skeletal philosopher challenged us to a battle of wisdom. It may be wise to study up on the subject.
A well-thumbed cookery book focusing on soup; very handy for the traveller watching his or her waistline.
*Beast looks to you gratefully and closes his eyes. He basks in the silence for a moment, then breathes a contented sigh.*
We found tainted chicken eggs. They hatch Voidlings.
Deal. Though it&apos;s slightly unnerving never to know who&apos;s doing the watching: the damsel or the demon.
Brother! Do not answer. You must run. RUN!
N-n-n-n-n-n... N-n-n-n-n... N-N-N-N-&lt;i&gt;NO!&lt;/i&gt;
Beyond that, I can&apos;t help you. Lord Arhu may know how to bypass other obstacles around the crypt... but it seems that he&apos;s slipped away from the public eye lately...
*Guess that he intends to try and solve the disappearances himself then.*
Good luck to ya.
*Moo!*
*Say that if there can be only One, it will be you.*
The moment we lifted the curse, the chest popped open. A finely-dressed skeleton fell out onto the sand.
Please step inside. The Doctor may see you. Perhaps.
In the elf&apos;s rage, it was thrown into the flames of our lizard graves. Even there, it could not be destroyed.
The Lone Wolves are hunting Godwoken. Ifan wants to know who issued the contract. His old pack boss Roost Anlon will know.
I know you know I&apos;m right. I see it written across your mind.
There you are, Lohse - I&apos;ve been eager to hear a little update. Did you do as I instructed?
*Ask him what he has in mind.*
Savage Twohander
World&apos;s gonna end.
[IFAN] *Tell her that claws are claws, it&apos;s how you use them that counts.*
A description of the whereabouts of a Magister laboratory in Arx. Use to read.
[1] increases your maximum Action Points by [2].
That, my prince, is up to you. But know this: when once again you seek your throne, you shall have the support of the House of Shadows. You have earned it.
Whatever the Magisters have done to you, little doggie, it can be undone. You won&apos;t die by my hand today.
Better to take control of our own fates than to leave them to the Divine Order.
This beach, you mean. It is mild. Gentle waves lap the sands night and day. I do not ask for more.
Bellson! My inkwell is dry - fetch me some more!
What&apos;re you doin&apos; here?
*Follow the sound.*
You&apos;re lucky I&apos;m in high spirits! Otherwise I&apos;d see you burnt to a crisp for disrespecting the noble subjects of the Royal Court. Now be on your way!
Looks like violence is the only language you can understand.
&lt;i&gt;Where. Are. They.&lt;/i&gt;
Chest
Pick Hero
Cursed Knight of Duna
You - you - but no-one is meant to know about that! I don&apos;t know who you are, but leave me be and don&apos;t speak of this again.
Bloodstained Tome
You! Get that map of yours on-hand. I&apos;ve got a little something for you. Garvan took nearly everything from me, but not nearly enough. I&apos;ll show you where to look.
Launch a magical missile from your staff that deals [1].
Swamp - Big Pond A
Prepare to die for your crimes!
*Nod in thanks. You&apos;re ready for anything.*
Are you sure you&apos;ve done everything you meant to do here? I could&apos;ve sworn you had some unlucky fellow to acquaint with your needle or some such. We won&apos;t be returning here, you know.
Brother Kalvin lost his Source to a Godwoken. He no longer controls the inner vault&apos;s mechanism.
*His gaze shoots to the ground. He grabs a small, flat pebble and chucks it across the river. Again, it lands in the water below well before reaching the other side of the cliffs.*
Maybe I could do something with this.
*The spirit&apos;s scowl softens a little. She tilts her head and appraises you anew.*
Lone Wolf Snakeroot
Learned a trick since last we met, have I.
Out the fort? To where then? The death swamps or the ocean brimmin&apos; with Voidwoken? Hah. Fat chance of gettin&apos; more than five feet in any direction and keepin&apos; your skin rightside out.
Single-Headed Axe
You are infamous: a brilliant warrior-general exiled from his empire for cavorting with demons. Fallen from grace, you refuse to give up. The throne will be yours again.
*Explain that you&apos;re honoured to have seen the goddess&apos;s favour.*
I know, I know. But everyone&apos;s on edge here. Voidwoken flock to these parts like crows to carrion.
Civil Abilities
*Your vision starts to blur as his Source trickles into your body.*
Belay the bell, Seaman! Do it now!
*Roll your eyes and say he gives too much credence to the follies of Dreamers.*
Preposterous!
*Ifan was in the Order?! Ask if he has any tips on how to fight them.*
House of Shadows Asssasssin
*Tell him to keep his voice down. You don&apos;t need the Magisters in your business.*
*Think on the note you found on the dead cultist.*
*Ask what Mihaly would think.*
Thanks for coming to find me. I owe you one.
*Ask her if that is the reason she bowed before you.*
Blademaster Guardian
*Suddenly, you see it: roots as deep as roots can grow; a sky blackened out by branches. You see elves packed shoulder-to-shoulder beneath a sunless sky - and all at once, they turn their eyes to you.*
You don&apos;t need to worry about them, darling. I&apos;m enough for you!
*The spirit can&apos;t help but smile.*
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you&apos;re happy to do the job, but there&apos;s no beauty in it.*
There. Much better. I apologise for my irritability just now. That and the punch to the nose...
Your mercy is conditional. I suspected as much.
But please, do not dally too long, wrapped in this novel euphoria. You have a task to complete, after all.
*Tell him you do indeed hope to solve the riddles and open the doors.*
...they didn&apos;t work. Half of us died crossing the water.
Jet Jump
RAUUUUUUUGHH!
Red Prince! Come... come closer... so that you may see me... as I truly am...
This spirit&apos;s as haunted as the graveyard it roams.
Sadha - miracle of fire. Of course I understand. No-one can stand in the way of an Empire poised for greatness. As for you...
Sail ye with her, lizard, or sail ye with us?
*Say you don&apos;t know what he means.*
*The looks they turn upon you are colder than moonlight on a tombstone.*
My child. Oh my dear child.
You can find more in the Cloisterwoods to the north-west of Driftwood. Hardly a charming place, but it grows nowhere else.
I owe you a debt. It must be repaid.
They are too many! You cannot fight them! They&apos;ll drag you down and- and-... *sobs*
You&apos;ll be back.
Source-Infused Meat
But let&apos;s pretend I fell for your little persuasion game. I&apos;ll tell you the Black Ring&apos;s plans on one condition: you release the Deathfog. You bring my mission to an end.
Nah.
This axe was forged in the signature style of the Knights of Gurrane, double-bladed for murderous mastery.
