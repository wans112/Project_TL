Hmm... a brash mouth and a dim mind... just the sort of prisoner who needs our enlightenment. Tell me something...
Lucian, Lucian, oh my Divine lord please absolve me...
I planned to torture the demon until it gave up its grip over the poor fellow. I began in earnest... but his cries pierced my heart. Even if the treatment could save him, I hadn&apos;t the stomach nor the soul for it.
I&apos;m glad Gwyd is safe. Would that I could comfort him in his grief...
An audience is granted; I am yet too intrigued to give my leave. Now tell me, Isbeil: Why do you allow the crimson prince before me?
So let me make it &lt;i&gt;vigorously&lt;/i&gt; clear that you are the most unworthy collection of primordial mucus ever to have been imbued with the breath of life.
Does your vessel even know what you did? The war you started? The greed and avarice that  saw you betray the Eternals?
Chased- *cough* chased you all the way here from Fort Joy, did they? Very well then, cut me down. There is work to be done.
*Say you&apos;ve been mistaken for someone else. It happens. You have that kind of face.*
This is &lt;i&gt;strictly &lt;/i&gt;a Divine Order matter. Very, very strictly.
There was a time when we both served the will of Lucian. When we both lived under the Order&apos;s roof. It wasn&apos;t that long ago, though it seems like forever.
Report back to Lohar.
[VILLAIN] *Instruct him to lick your boots. &lt;i&gt;Lick them clean.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Ignore the hostility and ask what he&apos;s doing with these Black Ring prisoners.*
*The spirit seems to sense you now, and points his sword in your general direction... but it&apos;s too late - he is yours now.*
[IFAN] *Look intrigued and claim you&apos;ve never heard of these... &lt;i&gt;Lone Wolves&lt;/i&gt;, is it?*
So you bring only contempt? This is what becomes of the King&apos;s fallen angels, then. Mockery. Torture. Decay. I came for the Swornbreaker. I found only Kemm&apos;s fury and a Godwoken&apos;s scorn.
If so...
*It&apos;s working; the pressure is stemming the flow of blood; Siwan clutches your arm, her eyes locked with yours.*
*Tell him that&apos;s fine by you. You just want to get out of here.*
As casual as only the living can be.
I hold anger towards the Divine myself. I could tell you stories about Lucian that would turn your muzzle white, little wolf. Yet, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; chose to follow him.
My sanctum! My intellectual womb! My palace of the mind! Welcome, and make yourself comfortable.

So... there&apos;s somethin&apos; I always wanted to try. And you seem to be the right lad to try it with.
*Ifan recoils from your presence, as if it is toxic.*
*Red dragons. Red Prince. Say he&apos;s about to mention the Red Princess isn&apos;t he?*
Godwoken. It seems you&apos;re not rid of me just yet. The opening of the door was as a beacon. Sourcelight poured out, as bright as the sun, as loud as the ocean - and I knew I was needed.
*You certainly like the sound of Divine power. You could do anything...*

The marshes are sweltering as it is, though I suspect you could toss a man in a volcano and he&apos;d thank you for the scorching.
*Tell her you can think of no-one better suited to the job.*
*Tell her that Roost&apos;s flesh told tales - about the lizard, about the contract against the Scions.*
But we must have it, yes? We must know what the dreams mean. We must know of the Change that is *Cough* to come...

Are you in charge now?
By the Divine, will be you be still?
We escaped the island. The strange and compelling Malady has offered to help us on our journey.
*Tell him you saw him club an innocent man to death over a few remarks. Murder&apos;s the &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;word for it.*
This floral-scented potion is commonly called &apos;King&apos;s Pal&apos;. It grants its drinker a great resistance to poisoning.
*Ask what she has... in mind...*
Healing spells and potions will damage you.
No
I&apos;ll take the contract as it comes, and I&apos;ll fear no Godwoken.
But first, we shall see that you are fit. First, we shall grant you power beyond that of your meagre mortal mind.
*Bowing before the statue, apologise profusely for your presence.*
Unpredictable projectiles from distant planes strike a target area, dealing random elemental damage to enemies or healing allies.
It&apos;s not a silent monk. But it seems just as... blank.
Welcome, dear Beast. I&apos;m glad you could come. Tell me what ails you.
*Lean forward and gaze into your own eyes. If your other half weren&apos;t an evil parasite, you might enjoy this.*
None is my concern. Humans hang their own and set their scaled counterparts ablaze, yet wrinkle their noses at any elf feasting on the past.
Let&apos;zzz go chase rabbitzzz.
*He hugs you back. The embrace lasts, and keeps lasting.*

Don&apos;t know what took the Whites so long to turn on us.
I went to that armoury looking for one of these wands, but Alexandar&apos;s bootlickers stumbled in first. I found nothing but dust and blood.
Can you untie me? Please...

Anyway, you&apos;re here now. You know, Dallis and Vredeman warned me about you... &lt;i&gt;Godwoken&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;m afraid your journey ends here. You would only bring ruin to Rivellon. If anyone is going to become the next Divine, it will be me.

Penny for a sick dog, people? Go on there, penny for a sick dog?
Deal with Jonathan.
Revenge. I dare not think about it. It seems so impossible...
*A vision of a bleak past. Deafening silence; blinding shadow. You see everything and nothing.*
My journey has ended, but the world still needs a Divine... even if it&apos;s my &lt;i&gt;murderer&lt;/i&gt;.
This bottle, containing a potion capable of granting telekinesis to its drinker, seems to jump within your hand.
Tell me: How are  you with... well... Voidwoken.
Brewed only beneath a full moon, this fuligin cocktail is favoured by thieves and smugglers.
I know you&apos;ll have my back when I return to them. Just like I&apos;ve got yours.

*Smiles.* No... you&apos;re all potential, aren&apos;t you? You don&apos;t have true power, not yet...
That might be what happens to Sourcerers here, but I&apos;m not hanging around to find out for sure.
*Sigh* Neep. Neep. NEEP.
Quite so. Let them come, those bounty hunters. Let the rabbits chase the fox.
The Dragon&apos;s Way
You&apos;re out of options, master of shadows. Tell me where she is.
*Excellent! You&apos;ve enough to worry about - let him take care of the Grand Nut.*
*Tell him he is true and brave - and that it is an honour to be at his side. He should ascend to Divinity. You will fight on his behalf.*
[IFAN] *Rear up into the most fearsome posture you can muster and roar like an ogre.*
I... I sense he is free! He comes... he comes back to me!
*Shrug. It was just a lute.*
I&apos;m on my own for this, I see!
*Too slow! Walk away.*
&lt;i&gt;No. And push no further, or we shall have a problem.&lt;/i&gt;

*Say that&apos;s ridiculous. She&apos;s the one who&apos;s walking away, not you.*

The rites were strict: an offering of mutton infused with Source and earth was set upon a special altar, followed by a rehearsed-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[A map noting the location of the altar is drawn in the margin. The rest of the entry is missing.]
[The book is filled with a large variety of prayers to Lucian, the Divine. Included are the Rites of the Return in no less than forty-four different languages.]
Then why, pray tell, are you wasting time? I may have eternity, but you certainly do not!

I think you know what it meant to me. Look, I... I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen. I don&apos;t know if both or neither of us are going to make it out of all this as mortals, or gods, or whether we&apos;ll even live to tell the tale.

I don&apos;t know. I didn&apos;t see it. I didn&apos;t see anything!
I&apos;m breathing funny. Are you breathing funny? I need to get out of here soon. I think we&apos;re sucking up all the air.
Rock
There are all kinds of monsters out there. Undead don&apos;t scare me half as much as the Magisters.
We shall finally meet in my eternal dream. Talk to the Dreamer&apos;s spirit and order her to bring you to me.
No coin? Eh. Not like a grubby reptile&apos;s much of an inspiration for an artist, anyway.
Tsk tsk tsk, too bad, freshie. So - what&apos;ve you got for me? Atta lass.
Leave the &apos;Mistake&apos; caged.
Are we to set sail, Master?
I landed on the island. I should move carefully.

Huh? Uh... wait a minute. &lt;i&gt;Master hurted me?! &lt;/i&gt;Excuse me a minute, I&apos;m going to go now, but first I have a thing I need to do...
But tell me this, did you happen to find a &lt;i&gt;wand&lt;/i&gt; upon her?
It&apos;s a dangerous path ahead, friends. Best to stock up!
[IFAN] *Alright. Yes. But, you tell the rat, you&apos;re not evil.*
I admire your sense of adventure. Upstairs, my friend, on the second floor, the experience of a lifetime awaits you...
No matter. Enter. Do not enter. All the same to me.
