You&apos;ve still some way to go yet, then! What can I get you in the meantime? You ought to enjoy a little rest while you can. Don&apos;t you worry - the Magister will keep you safe while you&apos;re here. My boy Kniles over in the Joy makes sure of that!
*Inform him that your power is greater than that of Alexandar and Dallis combined. You do not fear them. They should fear you.*
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 24: Dwarves
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast, abandoning the Crossleys to their fate.
Deal.
[SOLDIER] *Suggest she work on her self-discipline, and nod toward the escaping Sourcerer.*
The Covenant is a pact, a promise from the God King that those who help him now would achieve eternal life on his return.
*Ask about the Source-charged amulet.*
Voidwoken. Weren&apos;t anywhere near us, but ol&apos; Mack sniffed &apos;em out anyway. Got so spooked he pulled my carriage right off the bloody bridge. Pulled my driver off with &apos;em. I rolled out in time.
Hide under the desk of anyone who&apos;s rude to you for guaranteed last laughs.
Baa! Quite tasty, but don&apos;t think I&apos;m welcoming you to the flock just yet!
*The spirit of a Magister brandishes her sword in one hand, while the other is clasped to a wound in her side. She throws a hasty glance over her shoulder.*
The Peacemaker&apos;s cargo is on its way. If I want to stop Operation Downfall, my destination is clear.
A tornado moves randomly around the battlefield, removing surfaces and revealing invisible characters. Also clears Invisible, Burning and Slowed.
You... you cured me... thank you, stranger! Please - heal the others as well!
Without the Doctor - without the &lt;i&gt;thing &lt;/i&gt;that lives in him - there would have been no Barstan Tungs. No poetry, no accolades.
Fighter
Out in the swamps we met some burning pigs. The strange flames tormented but didn&apos;t kill them.
*Scowl and tell him to shut it and just count himself lucky that you decided not to act against him.*
Destroy it, and you free me to the Hall of Echoes. Destroy it, and my roots taint this isle no longer.
My word... Even I, not in my wildest, most demon-lusting dreams could have guessed a destiny such as this...
Get losssssst ssssscales. I&apos;m busy.
*Tell her you&apos;ll never forget her.*
Don&apos;t fight it. You&apos;ll only make things worse.
[IFAN] *Lie and tell him you&apos;re no Lone Wolf.*
I no longer have to wonder. I see for the first time. I see you. I see myself. And I see my future. So clear. So very my &lt;i&gt;own. &lt;/i&gt;Not Lucian&apos;s. &lt;i&gt;Mine.&lt;/i&gt;
*You cannot move your arm, your leg, your head: they are no match for the pull of gravity. Your lips open, but no words spill forth. She has paralysed you. Only your eyes are free to move.*
But the time comes. The time when Godwoken face each other, knowing only one will be Divine.
Keep a look-out for the runaways. One can&apos;t be sure where they&apos;ve gotten to.
Your Majesty. The Godwoken is no ally, but enemy. She would throw your plans in disarray&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;You have worked so hard. Arx &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; fall to the Deathfog.
A thousand innocents lost.
A bold move, but ill-advised. Unless he returns with weapons enough, I fear none of these Seekers will leave this island with air in their lungs.
*Look at him in disgust. What is that?*
Come to your father, my pretty thing. COME TO THE SOURCE KING!
*Quickly change the subject. Does she want to see what it taught you or not?*
Recruiting Companions
*Ask where he stands on the issue. Is he grateful for your choice?*
Fine, she&apos;s yours.
The Titan&apos;s Flammenschwert
I intercepted some Magister communications from there a while ago. Seems that Driftwood has been over-run by mad dwarves... and they were even aided by &lt;i&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/i&gt;. These are truly desperate times.
*The skeleton glances up, his big, empty eye sockets taking in your every detail.*
*Say you can&apos;t be sure.*
Cut short, was it? Then you won&apos;t mind if I head in. Royal business, wouldn&apos;t concern you...
I don&apos;t understand... I was sure I&apos;d make it. What did I do wrong? Did I commit some sin without knowing? Did I sin by thinking I was pure...? Blessed Divine, enlighten me.
*Leave him to it.*
Teleporter Pyramids
We opened the chest.
Whetstone Wheel
You will ascend when you take Divinity from my cold, dead-... well, from my hands.
Tomb
*The stone smells of granite and rosewater. But beneath the aroma a familiar smell lingers. Deathfog. And then you see it - the horn of the trumpet connects to a pipe. The pipe disappears into the dirt.*
Are you going to make me say it?
I failed in my quest. But Malady sacrificed herself to find the Nameless Isle and the Council of Seven. I may yet become champion of the Gods in the war with the Void.
This is incredible. What a structure...
The lizard courtesan shut up shop for the day.
*Shrug and say kids aren&apos;t so bad.*
Right. Of course.
*Nod. That settles it.*
*Say his head is furred.*
I doubt you&apos;ve forgotten the death of Meistr Siva.
*Ask to cross the bridge.*
A pity about your... affliction. It&apos;s really quite delicious.
Tread carefully, Lohse. Your demon will be expecting you.
*As his spirit furls into your own, you feel a coldness deep within your heart. A sick longing for coin twists your guts and sours your smile.*
Full
Precious.
Well it just so happens that getting off islands is my specialty. I&apos;m like the... the Eolus of escaping islands! Get it? Eolus? No?
*The Source retreats to the jar, waiting for a more suitable host.*
*Remark that it sounds like he was kept as her personal slave.*
How would I know? She and those Whites she surrounds herself with don&apos;t announce their plans like town criers. You can be sure of one thing, though: the Paladins will never catch her scent.
Bronze Cuisses
*Tell him you&apos;d like to go your separate ways. For now, at least.*
He&apos;ll be alright once he gets settled in. We won&apos;t delay you. Carin &apos;n&apos; I have guard duty comin&apos; up. At least we won&apos;t be late this time, what with Dallis sniffin&apos; around for escapees.
*The lizard is not of flesh, yet you are sure you feel the edge of a blade as it sinks into your chest. In an instant, you are no longer &lt;i&gt;you, &lt;/i&gt;but &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; - crouched low and concealed in shadow.*
*Tell her to wait - she&apos;s leaving? Where to? And for how long?*
Horrorsleep, of course. I had to find a way to protect the Princess from the Voidwoken attack in the waking world.
*Browse the creature&apos;s wares.*
Of course, if you don&apos;t have the wit for that, I can see you richly rewarded in all manner of potions. They could grant you health, strength, or even love.
Bewitched Hood
Counting your Chickens
*He called you Godwoken. Ask how he knows that.*
Driftwood - Fields
There, you have what you want. I did as you asked, and now I&apos;m getting as far from this cave as my bones will take me.
I&apos;ll be glad when we leave Reaper&apos;s Coast behind. There&apos;s too many of my former comrades roaming around there.
You&apos;ve given your loyalty to another. Which was, of course, the only action open to you, for it would be laughable to even contemplate the throne of gods could be yours. The inference would be you&apos;re worthy of a position higher than a doormat.
I know. Or did you think I chose you for your ability to take a beating?
I like cats.
Deal with the skeletal Scapor.
*Tell her never mind - she should stay here in her cell, and you&apos;ll be on your way.*
Ah, my favourite godless wolf.
We found the Captain&apos;s compass.
*Ask him if he can hear you.*
Yes, Fane.
I can&apos;t abide this!
My duty to the House of War is clear: I can&apos;t rest while the God King reigns.
*Wonder how the Magisters are responsible.*
*Stare intently at the parchment.*
Human! That&apos;s the term.
[OUTLAW] *Say that it&apos;s clear what happened - her courtiers betrayed her, and he failed to protect her. He should be ashamed.*
To cut a delicate path through a dangerous area, toggle into sneak mode and zoom in using [IE_CameraZoomIn].
Oh, don&apos;t look so astonished. I simply suspect we&apos;ve had much the same experience. We met with our god: you with Tir-Cendelius, I with Zorl-Stissa.
Can&apos;t find anything unusual here. But nowadays, one can&apos;t be too safe.
You again? The wedding&apos;s been... cut short.
Report! You must have found some connection to the Black Ring here?
Ah, my brother in brutality has returned!
*Say you were happy to help.*
*Lie. Tell him you fought for the Ring in the Great War, and you&apos;re glad to fight again.*
...and this is only the beginning. More and greater powers await you, if only you will seek them, and seek them you must.
Whe- where&apos;s my grenade? Where is it?!
Where? WHERE?
*Observe his uniform and say you&apos;re not in the business of helping Magisters.*
*The red-splattered young man paces the square once again, in a state of reverie.*
Heard you saved our lads&apos; lives. My gratitude!
*Look at her curiously. You were expecting a little more sympathy...*
After escaping with Han, he told us of an hideout deep within the Hollow Marshes. He told us that he could be found there, alongside his friends.
*Look about you. There&apos;s no-one here. What danger?*
Look. There&apos;s been a tragedy. Bride&apos;s completely broken about it, poor thing. So like I said: be on your way.
Magical Lizard&apos;s Morningstar
[The charred letter is barely legible, but you discern the words &apos;Nameless&apos;, &apos;utmost&apos;, and &apos;Alexandar&apos;, around the soot and scorch-marks.]
[NOBLE] *Justice? You furrow your brow - you hadn&apos;t seen any court houses around here.*
*Relent. If she&apos;s so adamant she can go ahead and talk to him.*
[OUTLAW] *Tip your fingers to your temple and tell him you&apos;re the cleaning crew, and it looks like you got here &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;in time.*
I may not be a saint but even &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; don&apos;t bargain with demons.
Almost good as new now, thanks!
*A sharp electrical shock repels your hands from the stone and sends you staggering backwards.*
The witch who stole Fane&apos;s shapeshifter mask seemed to commune with an otherworldly presence.
*Your heart is broken.*
Magister Idris
It&apos;s your life to do as you choose... but I&apos;ll be choosing to spend &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt; with friends. Understood?
*The soul flickers around the jar like a desperate, buzzing insect, but you hold its entire prison between your hands.*
Killer! Killer on the loose!
AI Personality
Now I cannot influence even a coin-toss. But &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; breathe. I&apos;ll wager you&apos;ve more use for my gifts than I do. Here... tell me what you truly value. If my Lady sees fit, I&apos;ll give you what I truly value in return.
Pretty plant, yes.
*Tell him you know all about his smuggling operation in the fish factory.*
*Grunt. Yep. Does he have a problem with that?*
*Fine. If &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; promises to be a good sport too.*
Leave me alone...
Kill the queen, and the drones&apos;ll just fly off to another. People got no sense, I swear.
*She looks you up and down with the merest hint of a coy smile on her lips.*
Raider Ruffian
*Your heart is heavy. You know too much; it&apos;s all too much. You met... you met... &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;...*
Campaign Name
*Look around for signs of anyone else.*
*You&apos;re still breathing in her scent - the smell of home - when you feel her claws. They press into your back, tearing cloth, breaking skin, pushing deep into muscle...*
Next thing the elf is sprouting vines, and &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;grows out of his corpse. I -
*Tell her you&apos;ll bring a better cup of tea if she explains what just happened.*
