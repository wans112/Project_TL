*Is that all? Boast that you&apos;ve killed many more than that.*
Painting
Gained two Source Points.
Prepare yourself!
This is no better than murder; I can&apos;t do it.
*There is nothing, nothing at all but you and him, locked together.*
No. It is not.
Gah! It fades. It must be &lt;i&gt;whole&lt;/i&gt;. Then the ancestor can speak freely.
Blood Forest
How boring. No, thank you.
*You&apos;re a seeker of knowledge. Explain that Bahara told you to ask her about Amadia.*
*Ask if he&apos;s actually read all of these books, or if they&apos;re just for show.*
What was your name, again? I&apos;m Lohse.
There it is! The Wellspring.
*Piece by piece, the weight in your mind begins to shift. You sense a presence alongside you - Paladin Keene, lending his strength to yours.*
Swap the places of the Incarnate and its master.
I- I- it was nothing. Simply a turn of phrase. Nothing more.
*Sebille lays a hand upon your forearm.*
Now, do you wish for me to help you, or not?
*Say nothing; allow her to finish.*
Tell me, does Arx still stand?
Ngh... *Hack!* S... Stop...
That woman...
Before... before... *he blanches* before...
I see. For that kind of money, my enterprising friend, I&apos;ll need to hear something of your business plan. Just the basic idea. Dispense with the details. Go on... convince me.
I have particular skills that she sought... healing, crafting... and more arcane magical practices. She had me enchant a dead cat, for instance, so it would seem alive.
You don&apos;t get it! S&apos;in her lips, s&apos;in the magic... s&apos;in my body!
All of this, because I could not let my curiosity go. Are there any heroes in this tale...
You are not a pile of ash, so the ritual was a success. Albeit partially. You had all the material requirements, so I can only assume your Source was lacking.
Nope! This one doesn&apos;t talk to me. It talks &lt;i&gt;through &lt;/i&gt;me. You&apos;ll know it when you see it.
Oh honey. I didn&apos;t hire you for your entertainment value. I hired you to draw my bath and rub my calluses.
Move FreeCamera Right
*Restate the question correctly: if a tree falls in the forest, does anyone&lt;i&gt; hear?*&lt;/i&gt;
Are you ready for the next assault?
Oh, this&apos;ll be a scorcher! Who ya takin&apos; along? Ya only get this one chance, so keep yer wits about ya.
One or more users have no characters assigned.
*Say you&apos;d like to discuss your deal.*
This hammer is made of denser stuff than its human namesake: Dallis. Spider-leg cracks mar the surface, yet it seems hardy enough.
A metal-plated belt promises to deflect any and all blows aimed in the area of your groin.
&lt;i&gt;*Fury, fury, fury.&lt;/i&gt; Hiss at him: his entire world is about to be pain.*
*Ifan looks to have been in a vicious fight. He rolls his sleeves down and casually wipes some blood from his cheek. He nods at you, the shadow of a smile on his lips.*
*Sigh. Okay, what &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;he do, then?*
*Square your shoulders. Warn her that her troll might be in danger.*
*Ignore your own nagging guilt and consume her Source.*
For shame, Scion. Saheila says you hurt the Mother Tree. I spit on you. I spit on your name.
*Ifan embraces you fiercely. As your Source mingles and sparks, you feel the memories of your night together caressing your body. The world can wait... just a little longer.*
(She won&apos;t help us, look at her, can barely help herself.) Yes miss, please help us.
*Hold your ground.*
You... you saved me...? Just like that?
Magical Flanged Mace
*Ask if the magic word is &apos;ruin&apos; or &apos;island&apos;, or possibly &apos;ruined island&apos;.*
[OUTLAW] *Reach out to shake his hand with the secret handshake of all those who ply their trades by night.*
Leave me be. I mustn&apos;t falter again.
Skull-Marked Door
Deadeye&apos;s Signature Crossbow
Oh, it coughs!
No money? You deadbeat. Get out of the way so I can pitch to someone who does.
Don&apos;t you see? If all species are affected the same, then one cure will save them all as well! Just... as soon as one is found, that is...
Something you wanted?
But that makes no sense! Think about it! You don&apos;t pay the ferryman until he gets you to the other side, out of fear that he&apos;ll murder you mid-stream, rob your corpse, and dump you in the water. My friend...
&lt;i&gt;No. &lt;/i&gt;You&apos;re trying to trick me, and I shall not allow it. It&apos;s time to go! I come, O King!
Bishop Alexandar called The Quorum together. He demanded the elves, dwarves, and lizards agree to his plan: Gather and quarantine Source users across Rivellon.
Oh, there you are, love! So good to see you again.
Well, here we are. Despite it all.
Character is sending [1]% of healing and Armour restoration to linked character.
Corpses
A brave admission. If not a smart one.
Ah, it&apos;s just practice. All in the way you set your jaw, lass. I&apos;ll teach you some day.
That&apos;s not a deal you can afford.
FreeCamera Decrease Height
*Deny you are Godwoken. You&apos;re not even sure what it means!*
We came across a captured dragon, chained to a stake. If we could free it, it might fly us away from the island.
*The dwarf rest his hand on her shoulder, a faraway look in his eyes.*
Only you can set me free...
It&apos;s just like the book says...
A world without Source is one that will need individuals of wit and intellect. A sharp mind is the only magic now...
I must have walked in the sun too long already if I&apos;m hearing scarecrows speak!
Really? Neat. I&apos;d start with dessert if I were you.
*Your Source link to Jonathan is suddenly severed. His spirit stands before you, head bowed. He offers only two words in reply.*
She was here. I felt her. I felt her!
The Mother Tree is said to be here. She seeks to make the world her own, and will not tolerate any rivals to her ambitions. Be careful.
Chew Bone
Execute the Master.
Demon
Although there are those that did not join our order. Some were quite... unreceptive to the idea.
That&apos;s what a bad thing would say. You smell bad. I think you&apos;re a bad thing.
Voodoo Skeleton Scroll
[HERO] *Say that it sounds like a wrong you&apos;ll need to right.*
Enchanted Bones
You do not know the question.
Undeployed Dazzler Trap
You look lost. Also you look all scaly and weird. And you look kinda... dangerous... so I immediately wish I hadn&apos;t just called you weird. Don&apos;t hurt me, I can&apos;t help myself!
Bridgekeeper&apos;s House
Looks like I found a thief, alright. You&apos;re under arrest!
(Press [1] to skip)
We found our way down to the arena.
*You tell him his enemies are right to fear the elves. All should fear the elves, &lt;i&gt;for the elves will rise. &lt;/i&gt;He must listen to his leaders. He must be ready - the time is near.*
*The man pulls a hunk of cheese from the folds of his garments, and with a sharp knife, cuts away a slice. He winks at you as he savours his snack.*
*Gareth smiles at you. You see in him something he&apos;s lacked of late: hope.*
Do not wander where you are not wanted. I expect you understand.
Terror Grenade
I long await this moment, Sebille. Finally we speak among tree and kin.
There&apos;s enough Deathfog here to kill everyone in Arx.
Reimond told us to report to Magister Julian.
*Tell her you feel very vulnerable. You remember the needle in your neck. She could kill you in an instant.*
Eh. Most of &apos;em are friendly. Interesting, too. Chatty, musical. It&apos;s... fun. Inspirational. Usually.
As per your own testimony, you can cook, but you have the fashion sense of a monkey in a clown suit, and your personal hygiene reminds one of a carcass rotting in the sun.
I still hear it. It&apos;s still there. It&apos;ll never leave me alone... it&apos;ll never leave me alone.
Ah! Finally. Your colleague over there is absolutely useless.
Metal
*You pull your hand away from the jar, your head swimming. You can feel the dwarf&apos;s cold terror still throbbing in your bones.*
Can&apos;t say I like what you&apos;ve done with the place.
*Don&apos;t let his cruel little smile unsettle you. The Dreamer: has he seen him?*
Pin Down Skillbook
Range: [2]&lt;br&gt;Poisoned deals poison damage over time.&lt;br&gt;Can target terrain to create ooze surface.
My my, you have been a busy little creature, haven&apos;t you? Yes, they would do nicely.
*He stops. Realisation dawns - this is, at last, the end. He bows his head in dignity and raises a hand towards you. Then he surrenders his Source. Arhu is no more.*
*The winged stone figure reaches to the heavens - a majestic sight among the leaves and branches.*
I understand. One professional to another... I&apos;ll help.
*Tell him no, you haven&apos;t come across anyone like that.*
Hollow Marshes - Dragon&apos;s Beach
Any more wiggity-woogity for me? Git on then! Go on - git!
*Note that the dead Magister was killed with a bladed weapon, not with Source magic.*
Thief! Thief! Someone, anyone, over here!
There&apos;s a murderer on the loose! Tell me what you know.
- he&apos;s a Sourcerer, dressed as a tinker, and responsible for three Magisters going missing.
*The dwarf looks to the sky, only to whip his head downward and curse the sun in a series of colourful phrases.*
Proper fates for proper fools. The deed is done, child. But there is still much to do.
Voidwoken Drillworm
Survival&apos;s my main priority. I&apos;ll use every trick in the book to keep us alive. But, if a Wayfarer&apos;s not what you&apos;re after, I&apos;ve got other skills. What do you need?
*You tentatively break a piece from the decaying limb and force it down your gullet. And then - horrors. Flashes of scaled slavers, whips and chains in hand and cruel songs upon their lips. Honourable elves, their faces scarred, their flesh ripped open.*
Walk on, heartbeat. I got nothing to say to you.
*Tell him there&apos;s no room for two at the top. He&apos;s with you or against you.*
Acid
Damaged Wall
*Attack.*
*Give him an appraising stare. You&apos;re not sure whether to trust him.*
[ELF] *Wonder what happened to this, your kin.*
*Tell him &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; interests trump his.*
*He gives you a look that is at once hopeful and hopeless. One last tear slides down his impossibly pink cheek. A hungry kitten couldn&apos;t look more plaintive.*
*Lohse breaks free and lunges for Jahan again; he deftly dodges her.*
Cecil, it&apos;s - ARGH! CECIL, GET IT OFF!
*A ghostly seaman rings a bell. His lip curls in a malevolent grin.*
We held them off. We held them off. We held them off and Alexandar was saved.
[1] resisted Death!
What is it, love?
No emotional attachments I hope.
Meteor Shower
Waypoint Shrine
Damn you! I should&apos;ve known.
With the world as it is, bad apples must be crushed lest the whole barrel rot.
Hmm. Well, I&apos;ll be around and about.
&lt;i&gt;More?! &lt;/i&gt;*sigh* Out with it then. Put me out of my misery.
Put your faith in ol&apos; Margo. She&apos;s not known to spit lies.
So thank you.
Number of Slots
Hrrm... I didn&apos;t see an &apos;Iris&apos; in the school records...
[FANE] *Tell the lizard that you&apos;re curious, certainly. Who are they?*
[The board is tacked with maps, odd diagrams like battle plans, and names, some of which have been slashed through with thick, red ink. Your name is at the bottom of the list.]
Micheil Ros sent us after Queen Justinia - to stop her and to save her.
&lt;i&gt;you serve the god king now so kill the divine order pigs and kill the godwoken go kill them all go serve the king&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell him he&apos;s in terrible danger - he must open the gate immediately!*
*Grunts* Be quick.
