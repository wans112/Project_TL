The Wayfarer was not born of woman, but of beast... or so the rumours go. Raised by the creatures and trees of the Phantom Forest, the Wayfarer learned the art of survival before that of speech.  Beasts that would have destroyed another human in single swipe were the Wayfarer&apos;s caretakers and playmates; dodging lightning storms, a matter of survival for most, was the Wayfarer&apos;s favourite sport.  When the Grandmaster of the Order of the Source Hunters learned of this remarkable person, he ordered an expedition to make contact. Though wary of leaving the wilds, the Wayfarer was eager to learn more about these strange but powerful Source Hunters...

*Sigh. She&apos;s never been free, has she?*
Their suffering is over - maybe they left something valuable behind...
The worn piece of parchment is scribbled over with what appears to be a makeshift ink made of soot and water.
*It goes silent, save a slight wheeze with every rise and fall of its bony chest.*
If I find you&apos;re hiding him from me, I&apos;ll cut off bits that won&apos;t grow back. If you see &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;suspicious, report it immediately, skink. Understsand?
*He breaks into laughter.*
A contract&apos;s not complete until you hand it in, so I&apos;m not putting my feet up just yet...
There&apos;s a reason I don&apos;t wear Order garb anymore.
Allies in melee range redirect [1]% of received damage to you.
Do not take my elegance as a mask for frailty. My blows shatter shields, and my thrusts pierce armour. If a warrior you need, &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; warrior you&apos;ll have.
*Ask if he&apos;s a figure from some other tale.*
*Reach out and squeeze her tight. Thank her for her tale, and for trying to live a good life.*
Reckon that&apos;s the case for all us sorry souls who find ourselves on this flea-bitten island.
There&apos;s a presence here. Whether it&apos;s peaceful, I can&apos;t say.
Good. We can talk, and perhaps trade.
*Tell him you haven&apos;t quite yet succeeded in killing Alexandar, more&apos;s the pity.*
You ain&apos;t seen it out there. You&apos;ll find your own limits quick enough.
*Shrug. You&apos;ve had better.*

When I was a little boy in the deserts of Mezd, I spent a lot of time wandering around alone. Once I found a pebble, small and bright and green, like a fierce eye. I never saw a pebble like it before or since, though I&apos;ve seen its colour in the collars we clamp on Sourcerers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought my pebble home and showed it to my grandfather. He was a Paladin, but very old. He said to me &apos;Now, that is something, young one. That is a completely new kind of matter entirely!&apos; His eyes glittered with zeal as he found a way to expand my discovery into a sermon on the Void and its seductive evils. As usual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A wiser child would have cottoned on to the fact that one could often trust the first thing out of grandfather&apos;s mouth, the thing said before any filter kicked in. But the second thing, the lecture pieced together by a fraying mind, those words could be disregarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter, the seed of discovery was planted. I cherished that pebble. Through childhood and adolescence, into the Divine Order and the life of a soldier. It stayed with me always and gave me hope when there was none to be had from the world. It reassured me that I was special...
So *ahem* there might be... one more thing you can help me with. But it needs to stay between you and me. I can&apos;t have little birds whispering rumours to the local busybodies.
I do not deplore his death in the slightest, but yes, I did want to speak to him about the Red Princess: a chance I was deprived off when you so gracefully skewered his neck with your needle.

*Tell it: really, &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;dangerous.*
Please, it&apos;s vital. He must not be allowed to escape!
But of course that doesn&apos;t quite answer your original question.
*The Doctor whips his head toward you. Lohse, your beloved, remains eerily still. Her eyes are blank and witless, her soul snuffed out by the demon at her side.*
Those half-wits below&apos;ll know more.
*Tell him he read your mind. You loved how rough he was with you: exactly how you had hoped it would be.*
He&apos;s the head of our sorry group. The kind of fella that&apos;d pull you from the lion&apos;s maw and dive back in because yeh left yer kerchief in there.
It&apos;s impossible to tell what illicit ingredients are mixed together within this old wine bottle. However, from the manner in which the bottle vibrates in your hands, it&apos;s fair to say the mixture is volatile indeed...
*She blanks you.*
*The woman freezes in place and starts to stutter.*

We believe the King&apos;s decree that you should not investigate the Veil was... misguided. We would like to view more of your research.
Put your weapons away. I won&apos;t warn you again.
You threaten me? When I have become so much more than Godwoken?
And you smell of burnt hair and barren dreams, but I have the good breeding not to mention it!
Ah, this is perhaps the first intelligent question you have asked! After all, one should always try to learn from one&apos;s betters.
There&apos;s only one payment I accept: your life!
*The child&apos;s glee quickly turns to sorrow. Tears come in great shimmering droplets.*
*Flames belch forth from the Dreamer&apos;s mind - the fires of war, the heat of the desert sun, the vast funeral pyres for countless fellow lizards, slain in battle.*
That game no longer exists!
Queen Justinia&apos;s advisor Isbeil is a Black Ring agent. The God King pulls the strings.
*The spirit of a Black Ring Defiler frantically drags something - or someone - backwards with both hands. He glances around for help as he retreats. Something beneath his heel &lt;i&gt;clicks.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Snap that you need to hurry. Time is short - can she teach you how to store more Source?*
*Close your eyes and sink your teeth into the black, foul organ.*
They do this to their own kind? Who knows what the savages would have done had they seen my true face.
*Tell her that frankly you had expected another bloodbath.*
*Ask what happened next.*
But you&apos;ve still too many with you. Do something about that, yes? Needle work if need be.
Then do it on yer own terms. Ain&apos;t doing Laslor proud by handin&apos; poison-tipped arrows t&apos; every warrior I happen upon.
I hear the Void. I hear it calling. I hear it &lt;i&gt;laughing&lt;/i&gt;. It... it is coming. It is &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;. If it finds you here... if it finds you...
What... what &lt;i&gt;happened?&lt;/i&gt; Yowch, my head...
Constance
Ah, a new type of creature to kill! How exciting.
&lt;i&gt;Finally.&lt;/i&gt;
*The Magister raises his hand just as the executioner&apos;s axe begins to fall. The ensuing pause is deafening.*

In Arx for Lucian&apos;s Day, are you? Watch out for pickpockets - they figure pilgrims make easy targets. An&apos; they&apos;re right, too.
Our battle is a work in progress. I never said we can&apos;t turn the tide!
Until later, beautiful creature.
*Ifan reaches out to hold your hand.*
Looks like my investment&apos;s paid off after all.
Utter rubbish.
Steamcloud Arrowhead
*He kisses your lips. Then your forehead. Then each cheek. Your chin. Your neck. The crown of your head.*
*Grin and pull on your boots. You seem to work well as a team, he should join you.*
Don&apos;t insult me. I wouldn&apos;t expose my people like that.
Guards - &lt;i&gt;thief!&lt;/i&gt;
*So, Ifan grew up in the forest. Ask if he has any tricks he could teach you?*
*Tell him you don&apos;t know what he means.*
Throw your shield at an enemy dealing [1]. Shield can bounce to another enemy in [2] range.

That divine voice, that idyllic poetry. Nothing like the other dwarfs&apos; uncouth chants. Barstan&apos;s music is as sweet and spellbinding as honeyed whiskey.
*Answer that she&apos;s someone who owes you, as she said. You&apos;d appreciate it if she just got on with it.*
*Brahmos clutches the Red Prince by the arm and pulls him away from you.*
We need a way into the Temple. From there, we can enter the Arena.
*Tell him you don&apos;t mind. He can surprise you.*
Dropping the barrier requires a... sacrifice. It won&apos;t be for naught.
We thank you for your co-operation. Be seeing you. Next time, Zee.
I wandered in the forests until the sisters found me. They washed my sins away. Fed me, clothed me. That&apos;s what home is.
Wax, black as coal. Was this one of... Adramahlihk&apos;s?
The entrance was one of mine! A beautiful little thing if I say so myself. It&apos;s built into the cliffs of this fort, but you&apos;ll uncover it if your gaze is keen.
*Take your leave.*
[This rather dry rulebook describes a set of rules for archery contests. It&apos;s specifically detailed on how contestants may not consume boletus mushrooms or potions containing them. In fact, it contains so much detail that you think you could probably use it to create a boletus potion...]

Maybe you want to go your own way. But you still need a place to lay low for a while. There&apos;s only one place fits the bill around here.
The Shadow Prince sent the Red Prince after the Sallow Man, leader of the Black Ring. We can use Sallow&apos;s magic mirrors to locate Sadha.
*The man grunts in assent.*
[HUMAN] *Point at your accuser. They wouldn&apos;t say that if you weren&apos;t human!*
*Wish them well in their fight and take your leave.*
*Nod and step away from the bridge.*
I am no mere rat! I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like you, for instance.

We took Griff&apos;s oranges from the lizard Stingtail.
Magister Mossyn
What say you, Quercus? That&apos;s good enough for you? Then it&apos;s good enough for me, too.
Alright. You&apos;ve convinced me. We have a deal. Here are the terms: I lend you the gold, and you leave me... a part of yourself. The contract is bonded by blood. The debt is repaid, at fifty percent, or you die.
The ritual failed because of our lack of Source. We should use the fountain in Siva&apos;s cellar, then try again.
Blessed prince! Bearer of gifts! I thank you. Now, hmmm, yes, let us partake.
As I said. I cannot.
Might as well have rotted in the Deathfog. What&apos;s even the point?
*Ask about this &apos;papa&apos;. Does she mean Peeper&apos;s father?*
Now &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;is the answer I wanted to hear! Hahaha! You got the right spirit, you do.
I get sack of meat every day to guard cave. Easy task. Easier than hunting. And this island keeps me &lt;i&gt;strong &lt;/i&gt;- not weak like other trolls.
