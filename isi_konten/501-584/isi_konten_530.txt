I see... well, I&apos;m sure it was nothing but a side effect of the fish...
*Be proud.*
WARNING: Those caught excessively fraternising with inmates will be brought before the Hammer herself.
Jahan the demon-hunter found the demon wars deeply worrying. And also terribly good fun.
*Insist that Champions of the Fort Joy Arena needs not prove their worth.*
*Insist that you have to enter the tomb, no matter what Lucian decreed. The world is at stake.*
Beryl Griff
*She smiles, but quickly hides it.*
No - you can&apos;t! Without his wardens, the Mistake will roam free!
Don&apos;t mind me, buttercup. I&apos;ll be out of your hair in no time.
Quite a handy little lever shaft... if you happen to want to get through a door with a broken lever mechanism.
*Fulfil the terms of the Covenant. Do as you are told. Kill the Divine and the Hammer both.*
Shush! This is Paladin business.
Fine by me, it&apos;s your funeral. But I know a place to go if you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; manage to get out of here. Feeling any friendlier?
Today, my love, we start anew.
*She turns her attention to the bound man.*
Rat
Chop Chop Chop
*He reaches out and caresses your arm.*
Two people. Two souls. Two souls just like me...
You. My companion. My friend.
I wish no part of it. Emperor of the dead? To sit on a cold, grey throne amid a vast necropolis? Never.
*Ask him what happened.*
Shock Wave
*He purses his lips. His fingers drum a pattern on his elbow as he assesses you.*
Ally
Another one of my Magisters has gone missing... whoever&apos;s behind this, it wasn&apos;t her... &lt;i&gt;dammit!&lt;/i&gt;
Only everything, brother. Only everything.
Good day again, sir. Glad to have Ifan ben-Mezd back in the pack.
*Reach for your weapon. You&apos;re not in a talking mood.*
I&apos;m tired of talking. You&apos;re just digging yourself in deeper. I&apos;ve got a better way.
Hm. I&apos;ll stay out of there, thanks.
What now, Godwoken?
Morning Person
(end)
I feel a little better. It doesn&apos;t hurt like it used to...
*Say you do - but you feel unchanged in your soul and mind.*
[1] - 1
*So she ran away... You can certainly understand why.*
*Beast&apos;s face goes red as beets. Were you inclined, you&apos;d crack an egg on his forehead, just to see it sizzle.*
In those moments of doubt, I remember not what Lucian said, but what he&lt;i&gt; did. &lt;/i&gt;When the Black Ring rose up, he stood for the defenceless, for all of us. For my mother, my father...
*Tell him you know much about the God King. Knowledge is power. You&apos;re offering him &lt;i&gt;power.*&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m a rat, he leaves me alone but... gods, the things I&apos;ve seen.
If that is how it must be, that is how it &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be.
Wow! Are you a dragon? You look like a dragon. But... where are your wings?
Please! Please just - just go. Erma? Erma dear?!
The babe does not speak true..
*Turn the phrase over in your head. Ask if that&apos;s where the Godwoken are meant to become Divine.*
What lies ahead looks even less welcoming.
*Duna nourishes himself from the Source that abounds in your presence. You feel it, deep down inside yourself.*
Before I let you go though, there is one more matter we must touch upon. You are travelling... with company, yes?
UI Show info panel
I certainly hope so. We love each other after all.
I hear whispers in the wind, kin. A single name - the hope of the elves.
Tea Leaf Seedling
[MYSTIC] *...a golden chest covered with runes, and overflowing with emeralds.*
Decorative Lizard Spear
A case of wandering hands, eh? Time to pay!
Black Ring Limbchopper
*As you sit down next to him, he produces from the depths of his garb a magnificent glass bottle, delicate of shape and sapphire of colour.*
A plain, child-sized linen shirt.
*They shrug free of your grip and turn away, inconsolable.*
*Flex your biceps and tell him you&apos;re willing to do this the hard way.*
*Offer her a chance to explain her actions.*
Could be worse, ya know.
*Ask who took her eyes... and &lt;i&gt;why.*&lt;/i&gt;
A rare... urghh... highly-prized breed called... uhh... I can&apos;t quite recall. This cursed sickness has scrambled my memories. I can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;think straight.&lt;/i&gt;
Of course I did. Only I&apos;m not foolish enough to let it buy my loyalty.
Cursed Electrified Blood Cloud
Creates a static cloud that sets Stun. When targeting a character, deals [1].
Coal Basket
How lucky you are then, to have my exalted companionship in your party.
*Gareth beams. For the first time, he is his own man - yet his enthusiasm is not a man&apos;s, but a child&apos;s.*
I hate the Magisters fer what they done. Stole me brother, stole me heart.
The lancet is powdered with the dusty marrow of your bones.
Raedalus was killed by Lucian the Divine. His spirit can reunite with Taryan.
Come with me. Resistance is blasphemy, and will be punished accordingly.
Find you? Find whom? Whose voice is this?
Hello there, mate. Still keeping the dead company, eh?
Character is invulnerable to regular damage. However, they can be destroyed by Source Vampirism.
Well, we can&apos;t stand around chuckling all day. Let&apos;s get back to it, eh?
[LIZARD] *Serenade the statue with a lizard song of tranquility; perhaps it will respond.*
Hope not. You&apos;re going to need it.
Mmm!
*Say things have changed since he&apos;s been in that chest. There&apos;s much you could tell him.*
*The altar rumbles...*
*...more powerful even than Dallis herself, and yet... &lt;i&gt;fragile.&lt;/i&gt; A hand falls upon your shoulder. A blade crosses your throat. Blood pours. Dallis whispers &apos;good girl,&apos; and then all goes quickly dark.*
Survive the Death Room.
*Malady grabs the vessel with two hands and pushes it into the water. She hops on board behind you.*
*Assure her there&apos;s nothing to worry about. Nebora, a tinkerer in Fort Joy managed to get your collar off.*
Seven Iron
Summon Parasitic Heart
*He holds out his hand expectantly.*
*Swallow nervously. Well at least you&apos;re sure you&apos;re Godwoken. You&apos;ll get ready for the ritual.*
*As the insects flow over the gorilla it starts to thrash in panic. It screams in pain as the ants start to bite every piece of exposed flesh.*
A most unusual visit, I should say...
[BEAST] Who cares who they were an age ago? All that matters is what they can do for us - and what we can do for them - right now.
Widely considered a variation on the fare served in the Hall of Echoes.
[SOLDIER] *Back in the day, the red-and-blacks of the House of War were a fearsome lizard fighting unit. Blue skin, red-and-black uniforms. They fit the bill.*
Already rested
Master tied them on. Pretty, pretty ribbons. Match my pretty claws. Match your pretty eyes.
Got to be going now. That pouch won&apos;t find itself, after all. Ta!
The Saviours of Driftwood... how did it come to this?
A map of the vault hints at illusions, Soul Jars, and Braccus Rex. Gratiana&apos;s jar may be there.
*Tell Lohse there&apos;s something on your mind. Ask if she has a minute to talk.*
Of course my first priority remains to find Roost. He is the pawn that will eventually topple the king.
*Snap that you don&apos;t give a curse about Amadia&apos;s love - you just want to know where the weapons are!*
*Sigh.* I s&apos;ppose that makes sense. &apos;ang on... so... you think I&apos;m beautiful, do ya? *Purr.*
It says it wants to become &apos;One&apos;. That it wants &lt;i&gt;everyone... &lt;/i&gt;oh, gods. It&apos;s planning -
We crafted the same piece of the Vulture&apos;s armour multiple times.
*Snarl that if she doesn&apos;t listen to you, her father is as good as dead.*
So tell me, if we weren&apos;t stuck in &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;, what&apos;d you be doing with your time?
*Bow your head. Justinia is no more.*
*Ask what happens now.*
*Agree. Welcome him to your party.*
Stay away from the Blackpits, far away. There are Black Ring there, prisoners! And if my colleagues catch a sniff of your Sourcery there... they&apos;re liable to treat you just the same.
*The chest won&apos;t open, and you don&apos;t know the magic word.*
You can see what I can do; what comes as easily as a morning&apos;s yawn or a rush of blood in the presence of beauty.
Still sniffin&apos; for blood, eh? Figured I could expect more from a dwarf. World&apos;s changin&apos;, ain&apos;t it?
I need worship only one Divine. And I believe she stands before me now.
Bloodied Chain Gloves
Garvan said the attack happened somewhere around here. The cargo ought to be nearby.
They put me on a caravan bound for Fort Joy... they said I was going to become a pet for the Hammer. I could feel myself &lt;i&gt;changing &lt;/i&gt;- I tore off the shackles that held me, like they were parchment.
Hidden Drudanae
*That voice - you know it! Rush towards the sound.*
I... thank you. Was there something else you wanted?
Let others play the game of gods. Love conquers even divinity.
Gareth&apos;s Family Farm
*Nod and lay a hand to your weapon. It&apos;s time to show him some ruin.*
*The interior of the cave is like a world unto itself, a slice of home all too far away.*
*Tell her no-one is coming. She can stop shouting.*
*Bid him tell you about his god.*
This is so, and I respect your point. I don&apos;t expect one so heavily armoured to seek intellectual pursuits. While most in Arx lunge for each others&apos; kneecaps, I see you seek a better way.
Why, how marvellous! I knew your Godwoken spirit was strong.
*The little spiders run onto your hands and scurry up your arms, a little black rivulet. Running, running, they reach your ears and whisper the secret name of this glade, so softly, so tenderly.*
Accept
...and insist their hearts do overwhelm their minds!
I said no and I meant it! Now kindly leave me be! I&apos;ve fishes to clean. And gods damn filthy they are too!
Excuse me. I don&apos;t appreciate being interrupted. It&apos;ll be your turn in a moment.
Well I can&apos;t say no to a deal that good. Be on your way, and don&apos;t make me regret this.
This painting is badly damaged.
She became his thrall.
To where, no-one knows, but sometimes the trees whisper a name:
Defenceless. I guess you&apos;re right. For now, at least. I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll be healed. Later.
*Rhalic smiles and you notice for the first time two vampire-like fangs glistening beneath his upper lip. A gulf of magic envelops you, and you feel a sudden insatiable hunger for Source.*
*Sadha&apos;s spirit departs for the Hall of Echoes, but her words still reverberate. &apos;They will fly. They will fly. They will fly.&apos;*
It was quite terrible and wonderful, my prince. Slaughter. Death. Opportunity! We were gathered there in anticipation of Lucian&apos;s Day when the Red Princess walked in, accompanied by no other than Brahmos the Wanderer.
[OUTLAW] *Say you saw him crack that fella on the floor. Clean.*
[SEBILLE] *Confess that deep down you dread the end of your quest. That when everyone you want to slay has been slain, you&apos;ll still lust for blood, and hunger for death.*
Spirit of an Elven Pilgrim
*Frown and ask why he would say such a thing.*
Carry on.
But... something went wrong. I was too late. The Deathfog exploded just as I arrived and the... the elves were... were...
*She bows.*
[SCHOLAR] *Remark that the lock looks like the work of the renowned dwarven smith, Varley.*
*Sniff.* I hate this game.
*Shrug free of his grasp and back away, saying nothing.*
&apos;...two...&apos;
I don&apos;t just see it... I hear it. You wouldn&apos;t understand. We must enter, immediately!
Altruistic
*He considers the wreckage surrounding the ex-cake. Understanding dawns.*
Ain&apos;t no tellin&apos; where that priest has gone to. Started actin&apos; all funny not so long ago, then flew the coop.
