Buzz off.

Now here I am - riddled with pox, and with nothing but  a harem of rotting fowl for company!
*Ask if you can help.*
Steam Lance
Buddy... gone? That&apos;s... that&apos;s not possible, he&apos;s strong as a Buddy!
Hired Markswoman
*Tell Fane that if you had a wife and child in the clutches of the Void, you would do everything you could to save them.*
This looks like a Teleporter Pyramid; it could certainly come in handy.
How dangerous? On a scale of one to... really dangerous?
*Her humming dies away and she stands, shaking like a marionette, before you. A single tear rolls down her cheek, yet no other change can be seen. *
Harbour Cellar
&lt;b&gt;Silence! It is your King who fell. I flung him into the Void, along with every last Eternal. And the power you cowards refused to pursue has made me a God.&lt;/b&gt;
Farro, come on. Where&apos;s this &apos;elsewhere&apos;, that&apos;s better than Arx? This is the greatest city in the world - I&apos;ll leave it over my dead body.
Oh, I don&apos;t know about that. Perhaps I&apos;m just tall.
*Ask what they&apos;ve found in their search.*
Clay Sentinel
Where - ? What happened? Where are we?
*Try to wake him up again.*
So. I&apos;m leaving. Just so you know.
*Ask about the little girl she saw - what did she look like?*
After we win the war, a new forest shall grow.
*There&apos;s a carving knife in her hand - you never even saw her pick it up.*
*Wave your hand before the spirit to try and get his attention.*
We found and cleared all four vaults on Bloodmoon Island.
You there! Girl! Over here, damn it!
*Say that he guards the Temple of Duna - God of the Dwarves.*
*Sigh. You have slaughtered countless Voidwoken with ease. Does she really want to pick a fight?*
Second of all: that tinkerer or weaponsmith or whatever-she-was wasn&apos;t knittin&apos; a sweater. That thing was made to kill dwarves with Deathfog - and I was made to smash it.
*The muscled dwarf absentmindedly twists his beard into braids, then unravels them with a single tug. He notices you as you approach, and greets you with an affable ho-ho-ho.*
The savegame&apos;s adventure ([1]) could not be found. It might have been removed from your system. Loading will not continue.
I... I&apos;ll do it. People are relying on me - I&apos;ve got to get them out of here!
Lucian&apos;s Day is comin&apos; up, and there&apos;ll be no steak on the table.
*Ifan folds his arms and steps back from you, as if your presence is toxic.*
Thankfully, it is something you will take to the grave.
What? They - they turned on mortals? I knew they were mad, but that...
We persuaded Brother Morgan to let us into the inner vault.
*Remind him that you found this place - not his Paladins. You should investigate.*
And until then, I am happy to do my bit to rid the world of one god&apos;s puppet. The next passing imbecile can have your wish.
Then again.
*Reach out and touch the cold stone hem of his robes.*
It was the thing inside. It does not want me to speak. It takes your mind, your body.
Hold them off. I need more time!
*Tell him he is mistaken. One day you&apos;ll prove it.*
Greetings and sh... ss...&lt;i&gt;salutations&lt;/i&gt;. Have no fear, we mean you no harm...
[IFAN] *Say that you know how the secrets of the past can weigh a man down.*

*Lie. The machinery muting their prisoner nears the breaking point. She must let you repair it.*
Get out of here, Ifan. I can&apos;t be seen with you. I&apos;m... sorry.
Even the most noble among us must occasionally dirty their claws.
Kraken sighted at sea! Several ships missing!
How fares the hunt, my friend?
See behind me? That&apos;s Linder Kemm&apos;s mansion. And if Cat&apos;s to be believed, Kemm&apos;s got something valuable in there - so valuable that if we can find it, we&apos;d be set for &lt;i&gt;life.&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask why this elf Saheila needs to die.*
Delete
Burnished metal glowing with a spectral light, this amulet once belonged to the last of the Watchers.
But now he&apos;s off searching for weapons to take down them Shriekers. And all we can do is sit here, thinking about the Godwoken we didn&apos;t save.

No! Not I, the great Arhu! I...
Free of the God King at last, Ryker made a new pact with the Demon Divine.

*The warg snarls and growls at her comrades.*
And whatever comes, we need to be ready.
*The deck beneath you groans and trembles, like the ship itself is awaking from a slumber. A deep sigh emerges - unmistakably the sound of a living being.*
*Reason that with your wits and wiles combined, you could get out of here. No-one would expect the two of you to work together.*
*Tell her who you are is less important than what you have to say.*
Bear
Powerful Awakening
The Merryweather was carrying Deathfog, a poisonous gas used by the Divine Order in the last war. It is best avoided.
*Dismiss him. That will be all.*
*The shattered inscription describes a &apos;burning stone&apos; offered to a dragon by the beast&apos;s champion.*
*Dip your head towards him. Fix your hollow eyes on him. Tell him you&apos;re a Lone Wolf, and you&apos;re here to get paid. Then ask for his orders.*
Jahan the demon-hunter found himself at a loose end,
Lohse&apos;s passenger took control and murdered the elf Saheila.
Please. I&apos;m busy. Events in Arx will likely quicken; we may soon be on the move.
*She stares you dead in the eye and quickly tosses back another glass of ale.*
Well, at least you are aware of your wrongdoing. But honesty will not save you!
*SNAP!* *Crunch* *Crunch*
I&apos;m just tryin&apos; to enjoy one last drink &apos;afore I go on duty.
Regenerating
*Ash and a warm red mist surround you. A memory flashes, and you&apos;re far from home.*
The Black Ring swear allegiance to a powerful being, the God King. This is not a mere oath of duty - this is the Covenant, and those who accept it are bound to the God King. They are Sworn. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am Sworn.
If you&apos;re looking for healing, Sourcerer, well... there&apos;s not much I can do...
*Say you are growing stronger by the day indeed. But you do so for yourself, not for the cause of a dying god.*
Ungh...
Dispatch Roost.
*He pours two glasses from the bottle. The wine is so dark as to be almost black. He holds out one of the glasses to you.*
Didn&apos;t we kick you out for being too poor to be drunk?
There were many of the critters, but I didn&apos;t even break a sweat.
&apos;Here lies Flannel Snook.&lt;br&gt;Sadly missed by all the Snooks.&apos;
*Leave the creature be.*
&apos;What tree did the Great Acorn fall from?&apos; &apos;Where did that tree come from, if not a greater acorn?&apos; &apos;Could you build a nest great enough to store the Great Acorn for the winter?&apos;
This was a Magister ship - let&apos;s proceed with caution. Who knows what they have hidden away below decks.
If you are truly free of sin, take the Path. If you survive, you will have achieved something great. If not... well, you have given your life to a noble cause. And few will find such purpose in death.
The sea beckons, Master. I will bear you to your destination. I exist to serve.
What the- don&apos;t talk to the barrel! Are you &lt;i&gt;trying &lt;/i&gt;to get us caught?!
Come, Lohse. After all we&apos;ve been through, you must know better than to test me like this.
*SNORT!*
Find a new icon in your Hotbar which you can use to toggle sprint on and off. Sprint increases your movement speed and the movement speed of your followers.
[DWARF] *Ask how Justinia responded.*
*Look her in the eyes and say you&apos;re proud to have earned her trust.*
You would mark me like you did all those you killed?
Gonna keep things movin&apos;, eh? So what&apos;s next?
Looks like it&apos;s heading to the river...
I don&apos;t want to hurt anyone.
*Grin. He might have the power, but you have his lamp, so he &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;grant you three wishes.*
*The creature pays no attention to you, and just keeps on loudly weeping.*
*Console her. Is she in love with someone that doesn&apos;t love her back?*
*A faint gossamer of Deathfog rises from a junction where the release valve meets a pipe. A switch allows redirection to a different pipe, labeled &apos;SEA&apos;. The junction currently leads to a pipe labeled &apos;ARX&apos;.*
Mystery Lake
We&apos;re off into town. Best of luck to you, mate. And come say hi if you make your way inside.
An empty bottle that boasts debatable artistry. Whorls and dimples mar its surface, but it&apos;ll do for your purposes.
*White-hot cold pierces your heart like a blade. You are frozen to the spot. The burning cold pumps through you like a curse, and then...*
We believe we&apos;ve found the painting.
&lt;i&gt;Of course&lt;/i&gt; you know me.

Spirit of a Canary
Sir Gareth thanked the surviving Seekers for their service, and gave them their freedom. Disillusioned with the rising chaos, he set out alone to find a new purpose. He would never stop seeking.
Wait! Just - just think about it, ok? There&apos;s got to be another way across the river. I can&apos;t lose my ma - &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt;.
It is not for me to judge. Perhaps it is the truth - or perhaps it is only true of the Godwoken. Whatever the fact may be, the story brings me some happiness.
It&apos;s right there in the name, is it not? We seek. And currently, I seek a way off this island.
*Tell her that Arhu has been rescued - he was being held captive by her very own husband in the vault beneath their home.*
This and that? Tag along? Do you really mean to compare the fate of an empire to whatever foibles you seek to fix?
Cerulean
Fascinating story, if a bit melodramatic. I imagine the pressures are getting to you. It can&apos;t be easy to be both Godwoken &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a Lone Wolf.
*Stare in shock. The King wanted to enslave his own people? That doesn&apos;t make sense...*
She thinks she can control him. She is wrong. A creature like him will find a way to break his shackles. He must be eradicated. That&apos;s why I sought the pieces of Anathema - it&apos;s the only thing that can slay him.
You&apos;ll see. You don&apos;t need me to tell you. You&apos;ll find out on your own.

Great to have your skills on board back there. You&apos;re a handy friend to have...
*Turn away. You&apos;re not interested in whatever she&apos;s selling.*
WHOA!
*Say you can&apos;t allow this to happen.*
*As you approach the salamander turns its head away, twisting its snout into the air. It refuses to even look in your direction.*
Quiet. Quiet! I wish to hear that voice again.
How can I tell if he&apos;s to be trusted?
*You are relieved of the past&apos;s nightmares and the future&apos;s burdens. All that matters is &lt;i&gt;now.*&lt;/i&gt;
Go. Go wander the woods. I&apos;ll be there. I&apos;m everywhere.
Good. Let&apos;s keep moving... friend.
Present yourself. I am ready for blood.
Soon we shall be victorious...
