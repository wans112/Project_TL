Wonderful! Then let us pray! I pledge my heart, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my soul, O Lucian, please return. I pledge my life, O Lucian, please return.
*Greet him.*
You&apos;re as guilty as a fox in a henhouse. Come with me!
[OUTLAW] *Drop your voice to a whisper. You need him to spy for you. Someone to dig up dirt on your enemies.*
Haft of the Swornbreaker
Or walk about like you still had flesh on your bones, in your case. You even have yourself a silky mortal voice!
*You tried to run. Your Source collar was heavy around your neck. You slipped on the slick stone and then they were on you - dozens of mouths, feasting on your still-living flesh.*
*Ask if maybe all that time underground has made him... overconfident.*
*Consume  the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Let me just cross some t&apos;s and dot some i&apos;s... and... there! Duly recorded.
*Relent and ask him something else.*
*Say you didn&apos;t know lizards put so much stock in their afternoon nap.*

&lt;i&gt;then kill the divine pigs and kill the godwoken kill them all and then perhaps you live or perhaps you die&lt;/i&gt;
Citizen
He was loyal and had heart. He deserved better than this.
I&apos;ve allowed the Magisters to capture me so that I can confront a lizard called Stingtail in Fort Joy. He&apos;s the only lead I have in my hunt for my former Master: the one I seek to kill.
*Ask the spirit where he took Brannt.*
&lt;i&gt;Cretin! &lt;/i&gt;Never darken this doorstep again. If you do, I&apos;ll show you just how powerful a Sourcerer I am.
This lock will never be broken. I doubt anyone will even grasp how the plaques correspond with...
Yes, a classic green from the Ancient Kingdom&apos;s Ziar Valley. The leaves are twisted into crescents. A sumptuous nutty flavour. Elegant. But not pretentious, you know?
*Walk away. Slowly.*
If we try smashing that thing, that leak&apos;s only gonna get worse. Flip that switch, divert the flow to the sea.
Etched along the blade of this ornate dagger is a quote from the famous Ancient Empire love poet Farshid: &apos;Your eyes pierce me deeper than any blade ever could.&apos;
I thought you were smarter than that. Looks like I thought wrong.
Flip page
*You shake in anticipation. Tell him you feel ravenous and powerful at the same time.*
*The squirrel reaches out, touching your foot with a delicate paw, and you feel your mind open. You can see the forces of magic and see how to combine them in a new way.*
Antique Paladin Sword
*He&apos;s a demonologist? Ask if he can help you with whatever&apos;s in your head.*

*Tell her to keep praying. At some point, Amadia is sure to grant her wish.*
*There&apos;s something wrong with her. Put a hand to your weapon.*
The paper is partially torn, as if this letter was written with an angry hand,
Please, I can&apos;t just let you walk away. Here, take this scroll as a gift.
I knew it like the back of my hand once. Alas...
[FANE] *No no, you&apos;re not here for games, you just need to rip the faces from corpses! Why is this so hard to understand...*
Clearly not, though I must admit that even to sit on that throne amid that eerie crowd, destined to become leaf and bark, was not so dreadful a prospect as what came next.
*The spirit of a White Magister scowls at your presence.*
Oh no, there you quite mistaken. I have already taken his Covenant, and he rewards his loyal followers.
*Looking close, you see that it may be broken, but it&apos;s not dead. It&apos;s ancient hunger calls to you: it yearns for Source...*
An innocent elf who was getting in the Magisters&apos; way. Like us.
*Insist you&apos;ve seen humans at their best. They... er, you... are a courageous people!*
Their names shall be remembered, and not in some Magister ledger.
*Squeak!*
Do you think I&apos;m daft? You&apos;re clearly guilty!
*Take your leave.*
*Decor? Ask if he isn&apos;t more concerned about his&lt;i&gt; dead guests.*&lt;/i&gt;
*There&apos;s nothing to be done. Leave her to fend for herself.*
The Paladins that died today went into the ground. The Magisters into the fire. Where am I to put someone like her?
[A book of charred research notes. Only a few passages are readable.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... confiscated the spores from a Sourcerer. We know they’re capable of germinating within a corpse, but how? Research is ongoing. Our next attempt should...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... an activation phrase! Of course! In the elf’s old tongue, most likely...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... horrifying. Incredible, but horrifying. Chm’r Doran - ‘Forever Sleep’...
*You find not guilt, but regret. You are a Sourcerer in a world where your greatest power is a terrible threat - if you are provoked. You are not at fault - but you feel the deepest sorrow all the same.*
The Line of Anguish
Great. Jump in the boat and I&apos;ll take the oars...
LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT OR I&apos;LL... I&apos;LL TURN YOU INSIDE OUT!
But we reaped Lucian&apos;s reward, the mists came down; and all our lands are dead.
People like them keep the city&apos;s wheels turning and its boats afloat. Magicians among us, truly. An afternoon of hot tea and warm recitations is the least I can offer them.
Blind faith was their greatest sin.
This is your chance to free us! Do not bow to the Great Deceiver!
Cinematics
Higba is dead.
Now, a little query. Where grows the yarrow? Hmm? HMM? QUICKLY now, for I haven&apos;t much time...
Do not preach to me, roach! You have no idea. No idea of the hell you brought on us all.
Yep, that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;juuuuust&lt;/i&gt; what he said you&apos;d say, Ifan.
H-e-e-e-re, fishy fishy fishy!

No offence.

[UNDEAD] *Tell him it&apos;s a long story. A &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;long story.*
Here&apos;s the beauty of the scar, see: it &lt;i&gt;lives&lt;/i&gt;. It is one with a slave&apos;s tissue and bends his actions against his will.
This herbal brew stinks like old troll sweat, but if you have the fortitude to swallow it down, your strength will be enhanced greatly.
It looks like these people ran into a Magister encampment, and were slaughtered for their troubles...

*Fine. Tell him to go ahead and guide you.*
Now then, to business. You will answer me three questions. The first one is this: can you cook?
Dream Chains hinder the Devourer&apos;s power.
You come here... for me? You desire another spider&apos;s kiss?
*Scoff. What makes her think you would release her?*
*Look around the ramshackle town and muse that the dwarf is lucky to have a job.*
Why do you hide? Why do you fear? Do you not...? Do you not remember, Sebille?
Not bad. Took some time to think. My parents led good lives. I&apos;d rather celebrate them for the love they gave me than to wail over their loss.
*Tell him he is a true warrior, and the Divine is in need of a bodyguard.*
*Refuse.*
Guy named Verdas. He was close to some people I know.
Skill Trader
*Tell him that the Wellspring is a poisoned chalice. He doesn&apos;t have to seize Divinity just because his father did.*
*The only suspicious person you&apos;ve seen all day is standing in front of you. Ask what he&apos;s doing in a fish factory.*
To equip an item, open your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/font&gt;and drag the item into the matching equipment slot.

Lockbox Key
I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re so nervous. I wasn&apos;t REALLY going to explode! HehehehHEHEHEHEEEEEE!
I, the Godwoken
*Say that these are desperate times - the world needs a new Divine, and for that to happen, you &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;to enter the tomb.*
My Mummy needs help!
I hate to sound so condescending. But sometimes, it pays to be straightforward. I&apos;m sure you agree.
Each step you take in these scalemail boots jingles a little. It&apos;s quite festive, really.
Draught of Strength
*Ask him to teach you the Endless Prayer.*
*The spirit flails, casting about wildly as if surrounded by horrific enemies. An animalistic whine emanates from him. He does not seem to be able to see or hear you.*

Gareth told us that the Seekers are trying to escape the island. We may learn more in the safety of Amadia&apos;s sanctuary.
Almira stayed on the Lady Vengeance, hoping for the Swornbreaker.
In a way, I suppose... my husband showed scant care for others. I did what I could to compensate for his failings... though not enough, evidently.
Without a new Divine, Rivellon will die.
Enough about that. I&apos;m travelling as I look for a particular book: a tome to teach me how to make corpses &lt;i&gt;explode.&lt;/i&gt; Would you have anything like that, I could learn from?
Oh, what confidence you inspire.
We used the Source amulet and the Scroll of Atonement to bypass the Path of Blood. We are one step closer to Lucian&apos;s tomb.
Doesn&apos;t it worry you? That it can take control of you just like that?
Caustic Leap
Speak with Lagan.
They will walk the same path as you, but they cannot be allowed to reach its end. You must be the one. Only one can wield the power needed to stop the King. Only &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, Fane.
Sailor&apos;s Shirt
*Mwoar.*
Still, at least this is an interesting variation on &apos;dismal&apos;...
Walk away then. I&apos;d expect nothing less from anyone hiding their face in darkness.
Got yourself situated?
*Take your leave.*
&lt;i&gt;Rav Mudom... Charol evdekeis racht... Veytou doran...&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her to think again. You don&apos;t want to hurt her. Or her troll.*
You should tell &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; one to Roost!
Uh-huh, yup. Master Arhu&apos;s my human. At least I think he&apos;s human. He always smells a bit... catty. Must be from all that time he spends working in that temple place! He&apos;s the master there too, y&apos;know!
We&apos;d just landed on shore. Minutes later, Dallis sailed in on the Lady Vengeance, screaming like a banshee. We had no hope. Most of us were dead in the blink of an eye.
You&apos;re either the hunter or the hunted, my friend. Either way, I&apos;ll get you situated.

Bah. Beggar.

Blessed Ice Infusion Scroll
*The spirit of a Magister mimes something, unaware of his own demise. He seems to be securing a ship&apos;s gangway onto the side of the dock.*
Me? I&apos;m fine.
Signs of struggle in Lord Arhu&apos;s quarters suggest that he was taken by force. He is the keeper of Lucian&apos;s tomb. We must find him.
...are you sure you can help her? What are you going to do?
*Point out you are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that lizard.*
*Lean in, lest you miss a word.*
Anyway... next stop Driftwood. Last I heard my pack were camped out near there. So, ears to the ground, eh?
&lt;i&gt;What?!&lt;/i&gt; Well what&apos;re you telling me for? Go speak to Carver!
