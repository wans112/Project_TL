*A wave of sound washes over you: The unintelligible chatter of your shipmates; the groaning of wood from floor to ceiling; the boom, crash, and crackle of waves around you, complaints from the sea itself.*
Mushroom
Explore the Surrey crypt.
Look away from the past and into the future, Ifan. There is so much work left to do.
Good riddance to a bad dwarf. Now to find Queen Justinia...
The Temple of Tir-Cendelius
... well, anyway. It looks like I will need to deal with the witch myself. It&apos;s been a long time coming.
Swamp Crocodile
Some changes will not take effect until the game is restarted.&lt;br&gt;
Vredeman is really the resurrected Braccus Rex. Controlling the Source King with a domination leash, Dallis used him to find the Aeteran.
Ugh - let me show them how a real assassin does it!
Paladin Defender
I&apos;m certain I haven&apos;t the faintest idea what you mean.
*Laugh wryly. The mark on your cheek suggests otherwise.*
Aw. I&apos;m always the Sourcerer!
Any [1]
That- that can&apos;t have been real. Those monsters, bursting out from the ground - it was just a dream. It had to be a dream...
*Her domain? Ask how a tiny rat can claim this place for her own.*
*The tears stream freely, now. He pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and holds it to his eyes like a veil.*
Blackpits - Gates
That&apos;s none of your concern.
*Say you&apos;ve had quite enough of these shenanigans. Who are &apos;they&apos;? Come on: out with it!*
You&apos;re gonna scare the others, now. Be a good lad, why don&apos;t you...
*It&apos;s accurate to describe the blood as &apos;gushing forth&apos;. You&apos;ve seen this sight many times before, yet never on a fellow traveller. As Ifan&apos;s green eyes lose light and life, you wipe his blood against your forearm and sheathe your weapon.*
*Turn to other matters.*
Oh. A customer.
Looks like you can spot a winner just as well as I can. For that, you can have a slinky little discount on Sourcerous Sundries!
Isn&apos;t it something? Voidwoken might tear me apart any minute, but at least I&apos;d die a happy man!
She is not herself. You must weaken her to help her!
Wow. You got it right, and what a challenge it was too. I am &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; impressed. Now, what&apos;ll you buy with your discount?
*Reveal that you are Godwoken. Where matters of divinity are concerned, you speak truth.*
Here you are. I wonder what keeps you. Tell me your tale.
I&apos;m - I&apos;m sorry.
Oh, you&apos;d know Gareth if you met him. Faithful lad. Honourable, too. Me &apos;n&apos; Conway couldn&apos;t be prouder.
*Say you hope you get to do it again.*
*She grabs you up in her arms, squeezing you very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;tightly.*
*She stiffens, the vines on her armour lashing as her voice becomes a chorus.*
*She dumps a heavy arm around your shoulder and pulls you in close, her breath hot and sour in your face.*
You seek the same information as Gareth? You stand in the peace of Amadia&apos;s love, and search for more ways to kill. What creatures we are...
Magister&apos;s Severed Head
This was a conduct award, I gave it to Magister Harrick myself... she showed great promise...
*Brush her aside, saying you&apos;re on an important mission.*
Hrrmh, alight then. Now leave me be, elf - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
She founded an abbey in the Dragonspine mountains,
*Scowl and say you won&apos;t stand to be threatened by a fiery glob of slime.*
*&apos;&lt;b&gt;D   I   S   P   O   S   E&lt;/b&gt;.&apos;*
[FANE] *You seek answers to questions asked aeons ago. You doubt you will get them from some mortal strumpet.*
Lizard&apos;s Spear
*...and with a rending, tearing sound that fills the whole wide world, all your knowledge, all your years of study - as much a part of you as was your scholar&apos;s heart - is torn away, and you are left bereft.*
The Knights of Drey are a dangerous, dangerous order. Lunatics with a single-minded devotion to bringing about the end of the world.
Do you answer?
I salute you, Scion. Saheila says you are the new Mother. Saheila says you take root. You are the hope of the elves. You are the hope for all of us.
*Slap your forehead. Of course it isn&apos;t, ghouls don&apos;t lurk by the sea. One of the merfolk, perhaps?*
Opposites Attract
Bah, did Malady tell you nothing? Trying to find good help is hellish.
...are you worthy of my gift?
I know what evil is, Godwoken. I&apos;ve seen what chaos can do. It isn&apos;t how I picture Rivellon&apos;s future. You are my insurance against that.
Joe&apos;s gone a bit long now.
*Thrash*
For him to sabotage the Academy - the means for his successors to rise? It makes no sense... but who can question his actions? The Divine is above us all.
You &apos;astard. &apos;ut as long as you don&apos;t o&apos;en the chest, you can &apos;astard all you want.
Up ahead; Paladins, the famous Divine protectors of Arx.
Redbrand Mage
Damian take it all! Where is the snake? Magister Carver will have our heads if we don&apos;t find him...
[1] Source Point(s)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[Translate101_dd95fe8a-3701-4a58-ae26-60cc0c719397]
Only the most desperate foe would enter battle with a harmless-seeming broom like this. Although the bristles at the end ARE quite scratchy.
*...that you &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;hear, for now no sound remains. All is calm.*
You have been a good Shield, and an excellent friend - Quercus and I both believe you can buy us the time we need.
Heart of the Mother Tree
I don&apos;t know. It doesn&apos;t matter.
But I have to tell you, I don&apos;t trust you one bit. Maybe I need to loosen your tongue.
Voidwoken... To see them is to scar one&apos;s soul!
You think a murderer can walk here untouched?
First wedding I&apos;ve missed in... *hic*... in... days!
Decorated Two-Handed Axe
No, no, no...
Find the hymnbook.
*The spirit before you drips Source from his raggedly-slit throat. Realising that you can see him, he throws a wry smile in your direction.*
You&apos;ve got a suspicious air. I need to see your pack!
*Say that you wish to update him on what you found in the cave.*
Thrown
not yourself
Potato Porridge
To read books or notes, open your &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;use&lt;/font&gt; the object.
You make me sound so &lt;i&gt;mercenary&lt;/i&gt;... no, I&apos;m merely pleased to learn that my new friend has such great things awaiting her in the future...
&lt;i&gt;...here we cannot die...&lt;/i&gt;
But... that cannot be! Do you not...? Do you not remember, Sebille?
[LIZARD] *Screw up your face trying to remember the melody of the ancient song &apos;Division,&apos; but it doesn&apos;t quite come to you.*
Tier
Ha! If you&apos;re looking for adventure, east&apos;s the way to go. It&apos;s a Voidwoken hellhole over there. Sourcerer at work. Powerful one. &apos;course, you &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; wait for the Magisters to sort them out. You&apos;ll be waiting.
Is the Beast o&apos; the Sea really going to accuse me of running away when the going gets tough? The man who all but handed the queen to a cold-blooded conniver so he could drown himself in rum and sorrow?
*Relent and turn to other matters.*
The time had come for her people to set down their roots elsewhere.
My ring... where&apos;s my ring...?
I feel it, you know? I really do.
The Doctor is not taking visitors.
Mmm. Braccus Rex. Thick as thieves, were we. Indeed, I took from him more than we agreed, but...
*Apologise again. You thought you could help her.*
Sir! You sent me from the Meadows near Driftwood. Carolan Fluffinster at your service, sir!
Unlock Amyro&apos;s cage.
Dormitory
A soulbond will settle it. A battle of wits. Then the cosmos itself will decide who can better face the truth of our own essence: me, or you. A weak soul may not survive the bond...
*Nod in understanding. So this is why Justinia is hiding beneath Arx - away from the fog&apos;s reach.*
Um, um, &apos;scuse me, um, Mister Weirdo... have you seen our ball?&lt;br&gt;
Paladin Keene
The grave you&apos;d dig, oh yes you would. But you heard the creak and then the click. Then came the bang! THEN CAME THE BANG! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
&lt;br&gt;From Weapon: [1]-[2]
Here I am. All of me. And I want all of you.
You want me to make a scene? Because I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; make a scene. Now. Hand it over, like the fine gentleman I know you to be.
Plant can lob acidic spores and emit cursed poison clouds.
You did all that you could for them. We&apos;re grateful.
Witch&apos;s House
I&apos;d think of Sadha, my great love.
You! Have you seen anyone leaving this place? Grey cloak, grey beard, a satchel of books under one arm? You can&apos;t have missed him.
*Tarquin pauses, taking you in. Genial smile and calculating eyes.*
Corrupted Tyrant&apos;s Helm
[LIZARD] *Say there are no better lovers than lizards. The colder the blood, the warmer the passion.*
There is no fate. The gods themselves are silent. There is only us and the Void. And it takes &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him it&apos;s in the hands of the Seven now. (You&apos;ve heard people say that kind of thing.)*
&lt;i&gt;And I don&apos;t share.&lt;/i&gt;
I see you, but you may not enter. Leave this place.
Here to register, sir? Good, good; Magister William is just about done with the last passenger.
How very unfortunate for him.
*Tell her you&apos;re not a boy. You&apos;re a man.*
She&apos;s fed up of being trapped in this cavern of course! She wants the curse of Braccus to be removed, so that she can find a prince who&apos;s worthy of her hand in marriage!
Trial of the Shifting Maze
*The woman shakes her head and sighs.*
&apos;North - Ancient Empire Consulate&lt;br&gt;South - Kemm Mansion&lt;br&gt;East - Canal District&apos;
...this ain&apos;t the thanks I expected.
*Tell Sebille you still want to talk more about Stingtail.*
Add gold to match balance offers
*Say that you won&apos;t let her dismiss your aid like that - she owes you.*
Find Gareth once more.
What is it?
*Put the jar back in your backpack. Tell her you&apos;ll consider it...*
*Shrug.* If you dunt care, I dunt care.
You know it is not true. This one is different. Dangerous. It doesn&apos;t want you to know its name. It fears you will destroy it.
Shade Shift
Mouse X2
B-o-o-o-ck
Wind Generic 04
I will have my empire yet...
Lucian demanded we submit to be purged, that the world be saved from the Void.
*Say that alertness is what you&apos;re after.*
Wrathchild
I have never seen one so frightful and one so... great. There is no end to the Sallow Man&apos;s cleverness. He knew to power the doors with a Phase Capacitor - and to do so while the pillars were aligned with the appropriate god; he knew that a simple mistake would activate the defences; and he knew that the final lever MUST be pulled by a Godwoken. It is as if he is one with the God King, so otherworldly are his senses and smarts. I will watch him closely; it could be key to earning the King&apos;s favour.
But to keep it, I must find a second Dreamer. A greater one, a more experienced traveller of the dream world.
Um...
[SWORN] *Search your mind, search your bones. Yes - the God King does indeed approach.*
Delorus&apos; Bow
Jump to destination point.
It ain&apos;t over &apos;til the Hammer-lady sings. I&apos;m pretty sure I heard someone say that once.
What am I?
[DWARF] *Sigh sadly. The Dwarf Empire was great once, but it&apos;s shrunk a lot in its recent history.*
Gregorius Swann
*Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles. Static electricity crackles all around you and dances over your body... yet you feel no jolt or shock, and it fizzles out as soon as it touches your skin.*
[ELF] *Ask why she calls you &apos;purebreed&apos;.*
*Tell her Ryker sent you.*
