Glad to hear it. Best to stay out of trouble these days.
Hey, don&apos;t I know you from somewhere?
Fate can&apos;t be avoided, it seems. Please - just leave me to the God King&apos;s whims.
Do you grieve also? My dearest brother Martrico died last year. I journeyed here to pray to Lucian to care for his spirit.
Emanating arcane energy, this mask makes the wearer appear to be a lizard.
*Turn to other matters.*
For my part, I need to report back to the Paladins on the state of this place. No better way to discover the devil than by diving into his heart...
&lt;i&gt;&apos;...sorrow. Our joy shall be the Godwoken&apos;s sorrow. Our joy sh-sh-sh... sorrow...&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
You must report this to Magister Julian at once. I shall remain here and keep a quiet eye on the hatch, should anyone try to remove them.
You mean it, or is that another line of yours? I used to play the harp, you know. Mostly around Arx, though sometimes we&apos;d travel down to Driftwood. Might be you saw one of my performances.
A Black Ring alchemist, Margaret tripped and fell into a barrel of cursed wine intended for the Divine. She emerged marinated in toxic ooze - and highly suggestible. She&apos;s cursed to obey any who can bear her odious presence. Margaret leaves her mark (a poison trail) wherever she goes and dissolves into a quivering puddle of toxic ooze upon death.
Well, they say bad things come in threes. I really should have seen this coming.
Get. Your. Hand. Off. Me.
*Dodge the question. Say it wasn&apos;t as good as hers.*
*Say you were glad to help.*
The answer is no less prosaic than for it to die, I&apos;m afraid. But trust me: the death of one will deliver the souls of very many.
Spiders as big as your head! No - bigger! And they&apos;ll grow a baby inside you if you&apos;re not very, very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;careful.
I will not be a burden... leave me be...
The spirit of Captain Ablewether did not linger.
We left Reaper&apos;s Eye without helping Lord Withermoore.
With poisoned cheese in either hand, anything is possible (except living long enough to see your next birthday).
We get this tub movin&apos;. I mean, what else would we do, mate?
*His right shoulder suddenly bulges and &lt;i&gt;POPS &lt;/i&gt;as his arm dislocates. His mouth gapes open as he screams. To your ears, it sounds like a distant echo from the other side of a valley.*
*He kicks the edge of the makeshift bridge, sending a sizable chunk of earth flying perilously close to your eye.*
Nothing happened. The artefact had no effect on me...
We have to. I heard my own Clarice singing to herself. A song about Dallis. The &lt;i&gt;Divine&lt;/i&gt; Dallis. Had to wash that evil from her mouth with soap. That filth is everywhere.
&lt;i&gt;This is Magister trickery. You&apos;ll die for your lies.&lt;/i&gt;
*He paws a few tentative steps closer and sniffs all around you, nose wrinkling with concentration.*
I hope for your sake no-one will miss them.
Goodbye, lass.
The Snoozing Adventurer
*Complete the countdown in your head. &apos;One.&apos;*
Oh. Well. Okay.
*Pay the toll.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82])
*Note that she appears to be a Sourcerer of great power. Ask her to teach you how to master your Source.*
Idol
The Shadow Prince is dead. And I ate his wicked heart.
*This was too easy. Why would he tell you?*
*Begin the operation.*
Identifying object failed
*The lizard turns about with the graceful ease of a dancer - or a duellist. You lock eyes with his: two smouldering embers that sizzle your very soul.*
*The Red Prince&apos;s spirit stands silent, contemplating the waves as they lap against the hull.*&lt;br&gt;
*Tell her she shouldn&apos;t speak that way to a disciple of the God King.*
*Croak.*
You&apos;re in over your head!
[VILLAIN] *Wish the rat a long and happy life, then turn away.*
She is Change, just as much as you are.
So the Sallow Man sends swine to gut the Pig Divine. That be right.
This cursed bottle deals [1] in a [2] radius and creates a cursed fire surface.
Well, you&apos;re clean. But don&apos;t try that again!
You see clearly, then. He stood up for &lt;i&gt;her;&lt;/i&gt; she stood up for &lt;i&gt;everybody. &lt;/i&gt;It&apos;s the true measure of a heart - how you treat not those closest to you, but those you&apos;ve never even met. His was big. But hers was bigger.
Ah, my unlikely friend. What do you need?
There&apos;s no missing the signs of Source use. Are you... a &lt;i&gt;Sourcerer?&lt;/i&gt;
Skills
Looting Corpse Failed!
The time has come to ease their daily grind...
My people. I miss them. But they cannot save me.
&lt;i&gt;Into battle we goooooooooooooooo!&lt;/i&gt;
*If he can&apos;t rid you of your scar he&apos;s useless. Lunge forward and bury your needle deep in his head.*
*Tell her you can&apos;t stop thinking about it.*
You&apos;re out of line, showing your face here. Allow me to show you the way out...
Summon a Walking Corpse.
Where are they?
A bribe? You trying to get in even more trouble? You&apos;re under arrest!
To Game Master
Pleased to make your acquaintance. The name&apos;s... well, the name&apos;s dead and buried. What matters is what they call me: &lt;i&gt;Beast&lt;/i&gt;.
Alexandar and Lucian tricked me into deathfogging the elves. My whole life in the service of the Divine Order was a vicious lie.
Wouldn&apos;t tell ya anything anyway. I got a&lt;i&gt; code&lt;/i&gt;, you know.
We found out where the archives lie.
Hold safe everything important to you.
*Laugh and wallop her in the face with your coin purse.*
Yeah, yeah.
*The spirit suddenly looks up. Her eyes widen as she sees an abyss far greater than anything she had ever conjured forth. Then she is no more.*
Fullscreen Display:
Resolution:
*But he&apos;s working on a spell, right? Something that will stop these knights and defeat the acorn?*
*Consume the spirit&apos;s milky Source.*
Nice show out there. Yer smoulderin&apos;, ya are.
Squeeeeee?
*Admit you had it removed, but you intended no harm by it.*
*Remark that payment of a reward for a lost item of value is standard across most of the civilised world.*
*I wanted to know more about this ascension.*
Pilgrim Camp
*Drain his Source. Enthusiastically.*
*The spiritual union is sudden. It sounds and feels as if you have fallen to the sand chest-first from the Coast&apos;s tallest cliff. You gasp. And you open your eyes.*
Saheila&apos;s Crest
Fire Cloud
Arp-kha, the Elemental Knight
*You feel Zorl-Stissa lurch forward in fury, straining against your will. Release it, let it speak.*
*Say it&apos;s time to go.*
*Ask what she intends to do now.*
The salamander gave us the magic words to its old master&apos;s burning chest. We are not the first - others too have the passwords.
*The candles glow with the light of the spirits housed by each. They reach toward you, eager to be heard.*
Do be careful not to break anything, good sir.
*Shake your head and say you&apos;ve better things to do than chase vermin.*
You can stay here with me, if you want. But don&apos;t let the scary lady come here. She&apos;s bad.
Bow your head - please! If we chant the Endless Prayer, the next Divine will ascend.  Even if your kind have displeased the gods so terribly of late.
Indeed. The masses tremble at my might! We will... retrieve Anathema! Our enemies will bow before the demon blade!
I&apos;ll remember that when I&apos;m springing you out of a brig somewheres.
Game Mode
*She kisses your neck, your breasts; twirls her tongue around your nipples.*
My advice? Stay away from the wine. Party&apos;s over in there anyway. People have died.
*Change your mind. You&apos;ll leave him alone for now.*
*Ignore the skull and take your leave.*
Sadly, that enlightened point of view quite clearly turned out to be academic. If not, we wouldn&apos;t be having this very conversation.
Do you? Well, perhaps you&apos;re absolutely right...
What&apos;s it now. I already bruised my arse trying to help your little friend!
It is impatient to be gone - but I thank you for your help. You save more than one elf today.
A map of the vault hints at illusions, Soul Jars, and Braccus Rex. The necromancers&apos; jars may be there.
You summon me but don&apos;t know my name? I am the great Prophet Patryk. I knew Braccus, and knew his secrets. I saw his rise and fall as woven into the Tapestry of Time.
Black Ring Pain Reaver
Sarias is home. We may leave.
So drop it.
*The bloom opens before your eyes, resplendent and regal. It emits a sweet, subtle scent, like that of a rose, though more intoxicating.*
The Nameless Isle awaits you. Divinity will soon be yours. Well done, Lohse.
*Mabel gives you a resigned look.*
You freed me! I owe you a great debt... let me assist you... I still have enough power to unseal the Source barrier that blocks your passage...
*You sought escape. But &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; stalked you. You fled. It followed. You came across a... a pile of bones. In that moment you knew that this would be your fate.*
*You look at your companions in shock. Black Ring influence or not, the enormity of the Queen&apos;s plan is revealed: to kill everyone in the city!*
All this can be achieved by means of music. Every scar is attuned to a unique song, sound or melody.
*Tell him you&apos;re going to walk away, and he&apos;s not going to stop you.*
Ah, so it&apos;s true! Most excellent.
N-no, wait! Wai -
Well, that&apos;s no good.
Who are you to judge a soul? You who sold your sword. You the cause of the deaths of children. You who liveth a lie. Who are you to judge a soul?
[OUTLAW] *Nod. This makes sense. But... &lt;i&gt;&apos;Who hired them?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
*Ask where you should go. Where is the Red Princess exactly and how can you reach her?*
We consumed the foreman&apos;s spirit.
Main Menu
Just you hurry!
Start again. Hah. No-one will want me now...
*Before you can remove it, it vanishes. You stand unmasked before the figure.*
Brio
*Say that you&apos;re most interested in how divinity can help &lt;i&gt;you.*&lt;/i&gt;
If you speak truly, then you must become one with the Death-that-Consumes.
*Before you can even touch the lever, you hear a sniff and snort behind you as the snoring Magister mumbles himself awake. One bloodshot eye opens, and then another.*
