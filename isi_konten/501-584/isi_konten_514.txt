*The automaton fixes its illuminated gaze upon you. The light within it flickers for a moment. It addresses you - garbled in places.*
Careful Cord
This hole looks like it was carved here on purpose. But why?
Helene. She served the bailiff of the House of Law. She died when the Voidwoken came.
*The Bishop&apos;s white robes are stained with blood and dirt. He appears shrunken in their billowing mass.*
*Ask her what she&apos;s making.*
Boys! Come have some fun!
Ah. &lt;i&gt;There&lt;/i&gt; you are. I must say, I half expected you to waltz in here on the arm of a demon.
You almost look exactly like every other human out there, just as every lizard looks like every other lizard.
Repairing [1] will cost you [2] Gold
Disgustin&apos;.
Delorus is dead because of us, plain and simple. Those who would be Divine should not be so cold-hearted.
Helmets &amp; Gloves
Devil... &lt;i&gt;vampire!&lt;/i&gt; Stay away from me!
Can&apos;t go on without the captain. It&apos;d be uncivilised.
Swamp - Murky Waters B
*Fold your arms across your chest and give her a steady stare.*
*Ifan looks at you coolly, but says nothing.*
*This is too much to bear! You could never kill your lover. &lt;i&gt;Consume him.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Hold up your hand. There&apos;s no need for her to continue her painful story.*
Higba spoke of Hannag, a Sourcerer who may be able to mentor us. We should start the search at Paradise Downs.
...I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about - I&apos;m perfectly calm.
*Deep inside, you can feel your god stirring. It&apos;s recoiling, revolted. No wonder Zorl-Stissa turned this one away...*
*Unseen, you slit their throat before they even know you&apos;re there.*
*Tell her not to believe in foolish fantasies.*
You&apos;re... you&apos;re leaving her - &lt;i&gt;why? &lt;/i&gt;Nothing good will come of her in this place, she needs to be brought someplace where she can be helped!
Hrrmph. Think you&apos;re special or something? Too good for my verse? You&apos;re nothing but a bloody lizard!
Plains - Quiet Road B

Flawed Amulet
Oh, blast and bother, Jimmy! Show some civility to our esteemed visitor, won&apos;t you?
*Frown. Why would Sadha join forces with the Black Ring?*
Ooooooo Baran won&apos;t like that.
My hero. I&apos;m grateful.
Incandescent Incinerator
Trying&apos;s not enough.
Sorry sweetpea, but it&apos;s a fair point. We may need your Source, but the good news is you&apos;ll make a &lt;i&gt;beautiful &lt;/i&gt;corpse...
Leave... me... out... of... your... chaos... and... your... death. Mmmmm? Leave... me... be.
I&apos;ve had quite enough! My sword will settle this!
It gives me great pain. I am with my family, we are making beautiful magic. We are healing a tree cut down with great violence. The Magisters come. My family runs, but I fall. My son looks back. I shout to him to run. I am taken.
Even if someone really deserves it, murder in broad daylight is sure to bring guards to your doorstep.
Hmmm? I am Stingtail. *Ahem* Who is asking?
*Tell her Peeper won&apos;t stop following you. It seems to think you&apos;re its mother.*
*Leave the jar alone.*
The dead toymaker usually wore the amulet. The scroll is in his desk, upstairs from his shop.
Aye... sooner than you might think, if the rumours are true. Let&apos;s just say that there&apos;s other places where I&apos;d be appreciated, more than I am in Driftwood...
Charmed status temporarily turns a target&apos;s allegiance around.
Stairs
Best night&apos;s business the healer had in &lt;i&gt;months&lt;/i&gt;.
Focus not on death and irony, Ifan. You&apos;ve had enough of those. It&apos;s time to turn your lupine gaze to life and ascension instead.
The future of all that is depends on you, and you alone.
Garrick the hero stashed valuables in the Stonegarden. We should consult our map.
Guards! Help me, help me! I don&apos;t want to go, I don&apos;t want to go!
*Sebille spots the man she&apos;s been looking for. She steps forward and asks Griff the cook about the Lone Wolves: a dead little birdie told her he&apos;s the man to talk to.*
Find out what the skeletal arm wants.
*His grip is like a snare: the harder you struggle, the tighter it grows. You&apos;re actually beginning to worry.*
[LIZARD] *Flex your claws and walk away from the insolent human without a word.*
I have no doubt about that. But do remember: You can do what&apos;s good for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, too. All things in balance, you know.
Core
What&apos;s up, chief.
*Stingtail. House of Dreams. You have spared him. For now.*
My fight is strong. No way I will be bested.
*Tell him to follow you outside.*
Squeee! Squee squee!
*Say that you don&apos;t know any Ryker: who is he?*
[JESTER] *Sigh dreamily and ask him what&apos;s in a name, anyway.*
*She cannot sway you. You&apos;ll consume her Source.*
Zppt
Those bleedin&apos; fools... think... think they run the place... but... but I showed &apos;em...
Claim Divinity.
*Agree to fight. You will become the Champion of the Arena.*
She lies beyond. Do what you can, please.
But there&apos;s nothing we can do about it now, is there?
So what next? Grapevine says you know the whereabouts of more Godwoken. Guess you&apos;ll be taking them on over Roost&apos;s way, eh?
The Witch grinned over the great cauldron. Golden vapours twined upward in intricate patterns, and a fragrance of sweet jasmine filled the dark cellar. The perfect poison, the Witch thought. Beautiful and deadly. Suddenly, BANG; the cellar door flew open and a troop of ten Source Hunters burst in. The Witch smiled and, with a single nod, a small army of oozing undead filled the space before the cauldron. &apos;This time, we are not here to fight,&apos; the leader of the Source Hunters called. &apos;We need you.&apos; She paused. &apos;...and you need us.&apos;
I like playin&apos;, too, though me brother Laslo was the real talent. Duets with him brought out th&apos; best in me.
The Great Acorn will come - it will destroy the world, and squirrels will reign supreme forever. I fail to see what&apos;s so difficult to grasp.
And I don&apos;t appreciate your kind conjurin&apos; up these horrors from gods-know-how-deep! But we&apos;ve got to live with each other, ain&apos;t we? For now...
Spirit of White Magister Jonathan
*Shake your head. Tell him he and his friends shall be the ones to die.*
*Take a bow. Here you are. Now let&apos;s get on with whatever comes next.*
You walk a dangerous path. Try not to drive away &lt;i&gt;every &lt;/i&gt;fool still on your side.
It brings me such pleasure to know that my name is still spoken, sister. All should know that no weapons can stand against mine!
My soul. Mine to claim! What remains is yours, mystic, though they are of use in this world alone.
*She reaches for your hand and squeezes it hard - hard enough to make your knuckles ache.*
*Listen closely, but tell her you hear nothing.*
*Look her in the eyes, smile, and say don&apos;t fear her: you love her.*
*Leave him in his ignorance.*
Sink your fangs into the enemy, dealing [1] and setting Bleeding.
Patience, my friend, &lt;i&gt;patience&lt;/i&gt;! I&apos;ll get to the recitation right soon enough...
Anyway, here I am, yammerin&apos; like a newborn otter pup. As prone as I am to talkin&apos;, I don&apos;t always have much interestin&apos; to say.
*The squirrel and the cat huddle together, the squirrel petting him with long, slow strokes. Sometimes his fingers curl, as if he&apos;s forgotten that his friend&apos;s fur is long gone.*
A Seeker c-can always recognise a Sourcerer when they see one... though of course your collar gives you away...
Common Amulet
[SCHOLAR] *Look at the yellow lever - it seems to divert the pipe flow. Use it.*
Don&apos;t talk to me again. Good day.
Actually, do as you please. It makes no difference one way or the other. You may not believe in fate, but you ought to believe in &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
Black Ring Seer
[HUMAN] *Sigh and state such cruelty is unworthy of a fellow human being.*
Excuse me - have you word from the city? I heard the Paladins inside have overthrown the Magisters. But how can that be?
The ritual worked. The Hall of Echoes was revealed once more.
*Heed his warning. You have other questions anyway.*
*Your face feels numb - as usual - but your teeth tingle and you find yourself worrying about what the alcohol is doing to your insides. Feeling bold, you take the third glass and knock it back in one.*
I&apos;m fine.
It has been her will that I take in these poor souls as they flee to preserve the gifts she has bestowed on them.
We entered Kemm&apos;s vault.
Urgh, it speaks to us, Quercus. As if it had any right. Honestly, some creatures deserve everything the Great Acorn has in store for them.
*He eyes you up and down, measuring your worth.*
Whatever we believe, we still need to &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; in the here and now. So... let&apos;s get back to work?
Sealing the Veil will lock our people away forever. They will never be free of the Void!
The Devourer&apos;s presence honours us! I humbly walk in your shadow, mighty dragon.
*Tell him you need to find the groom. Where is he?*
*Ask her name.*
Old habits die hard.

We couldn&apos;t let it happen. We &lt;i&gt;needed &lt;/i&gt;it. So I- I took control.

Figurehead
*You hold out your fingers to the dog. It sniffs, licks once, then turns its head.*
A shroud of ice freezes the character in place and renders them invulnerable to damage.
Empty Bottle

See? All runaways, everyone run from something. You from me!
But now, thanks to your daring-do, I am a free man - and a grateful one.
Isbeil leached the Source from these people!
I pray it ain&apos;t too late.
Healer&apos;s House
That so? Tell me: What would a lizardkin know about Zoor?
Protect them and guide them. Keep them safe.
Amyro... where are you...? Your light is... not here. Amyro...?
There you are!
I do know ya. Used to, anyhow.
Your Installed Gift Bags
[SCHOLAR] *The skull&apos;s abnormal position bothers you. Take a closer look.*
Enlightenment Herbmix
Do not heed me or any other, only your own lust for power, just like a god should!

I cannot stop thinking about the strange book I read in the lizard consulate. Such powerful-sounding beings - could they even be real?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Events in Arx are so interesting of late - once matters settle, I must commit myself to studying these supposed beings further. I must learn more of this bizarre life cycle of theirs, and the strange manner in which they sustain themselves. What I read of them seems to suggest that an entirely new world awaits...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A shame that I cannot recall the name of the author - why didn&apos;t I take note of it? The book must surely be nothing but ashes now, along with the rest of the consulate.
You cannot deactivate innate skills.
We helped the elven leader Tovah avenge the death of her daughter Saheila.
Then he died for nothing! Then more will vanish - just you wait and see...
*Say you&apos;ll fetch a doctor - she doesn&apos;t look well at all.*
*Growl...* &lt;i&gt;I kiiiiiiiill you, man-meat.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell the guard you&apos;re itching for a fight, and he&apos;s your mark.*
*Turn your back. The demon&apos;s name is surely a poison. You&apos;d rather not hear it.*
There were more of these nightmares across the city. It&apos;s a bloody disaster.

So, Godwoken. You&apos;re what gets some of us out of bed each morning. What do you make of that?

She went for my neck, quick as a charging cobra, but then suddenly it&apos;s as if time ground to a halt.
