*Laugh and say you&apos;ve faced plenty of danger in your time - a kitchen doesn&apos;t hold any terrors for you. Why is she so keen for you to leave?*
I&apos;m not going to run that easily - this is the haul of a lifetime!
I care not for their lies, but for their powers. What the gods have given us so far is real and true enough for me.
*Report that you know who&apos;s killing Magisters in town.*
Come baaaaaack...
*Try to fix it.*
Look, pal. Nobody&apos;s coming in or out of the city &apos;til we&apos;ve taken care of the threat. If you want to hurry that up, I&apos;d suggest you grab a weapon and help out...
Let&apos;s get down to brass tacks. Fighting, I mean.
Wooden Wagon
She&apos;s stronger than you know! Stronger than you know, boy. And faster too!
Lady Vikra
*Admit that the very thought of losing even more memories, even more of your kind, strikes you with dread.*
Wizardry is embedded in my nature as deeply as the instincts to breathe and drink and mate. The dominion over fire suits me best, truth be told, but there is no school of magic I cannot master.
Search
Davrick Grigsby
Look, I&apos;m flattered, but you&apos;re no doe rabbit. Not. Interested.
*Tell Ros to cut the crap and tell you where you can find Queen Justinia.*
You do not disappoint, my prince. You&apos;re every bit the enigma they said you&apos;d be.
Moving to reinforcement deployer!
Her Majesty&apos;s business, sister. Ain&apos;t nothing for you to worry about.
*Ask how she escaped.*
*A war yet to come? How does he know of such a thing?*
*Leave it be.*
The demon has gone - but I am still its slave. While it lives, I am bound by its shackles to this humble plane.
*His sword clangs against the cobbles, slipping out of his hands and skittering towards you. Cursing loudly, he crawls towards you, searching hands running over the stone. He&apos;s blind!*
Mug of Water
[BARBARIAN] *Tell him you don&apos;t hold much with smart.*
*Eagerly hold out the jar. As she leans in to take it, drop it to the ground.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve changed your mind. You will not kill the Godwoken.*
Set the maximum amount of autosaves the game is allowed to keep.
*...that you &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;hear, for now no sound remains. All is calm.*
Get that girl and her head-sucker outta here!
I&apos;m thankful, friend. Blessings on your kin, and your kin&apos;s kin.
Charred Corpse
Hurts, doesn&apos;t it?
*Smirk to yourself. They&apos;re certainly not having much luck killing him...*
*Nothing remains of the life you led. The long years after death, resisting the tree as it tried to take your Source, have left you with little more than an overwhelming sense of... betrayal.*
*Ask when you can expect to set sail.*
*The harder you yank, the tighter the bond grows.*
You would betray our bargain, would you? Then I&apos;m afraid the terms have... changed.
Smoke and flame. Pain and ruin...
Squee squeeeeeee!
Small Strongbox
&lt;i&gt;Your holiness.&lt;/i&gt;
Do you ssserve the God King, ssscum? Then like usss you mussst take the Sssallow Man&apos;s orders, when they come.
Avoid belching near open flames after consumption.
&apos;Thrall&apos;, you say? Ain&apos;t rightly know what that is, but feels like I just woke up from a weekend blackout.
*Assure him that you&apos;re nothing like Alexandar. So what&apos;s next? How do you become Divine?*
*The stone is cold against your palm. If this figure once held power, it has since been depleted.*
You&apos;re no Magister. A crimson lizard dressed in haphazard garb? How&apos;d you come to be here?
The wayward chronicler is locked inside the gauntlets you bear. He follows because he must.
*The Magister nods curtly in thanks, turns, and walks away.*
The kraken rose once more. This time we were better equipped to fight it.
No. But our turn - my people&apos;s turn - is over.
The Devourer&apos;s boots are ours. When we picked them up, there was an intense longing to find an excavation site in the east. We had an unusual vision of fire and ash.
Some would call this blasphemy, but a truly powerful demon can be somewhat like a god: omnipresent. It can manifest itself in several places and several people.
*Ifan pulls you into his strong arms and holds you close, kissing the top of your head tenderly.*
I Like Barrels
Poisoned Bottle of Beer
I don&apos;t give a damn who killed who - my orders were to catch Higba and he slipped away...
Well. I&apos;m embarrassed now. The wife&apos;d laugh. I&apos;m always putting me big foot in it. My apologies, sir. Or madam? Gods, there I go again.
I will use it.
*Say her armour matches a piece you found.*
[IFAN] *Repeat yourself. You bring no word for them.*
*Ask what she remembers about the last few days.*
I don&apos;t want to hurt her. Don&apos;t make me...!
Now, be on your way. Who knows where he could strike next.
*Pledge yourself to the God King.*
Stun targets in a [2] radius and deal [1] to them.
Come on, now. Jus&apos; a song, yeah? No dwarf worth their own beard believes it true, but you know how it goes. Ya sing a song and pretty soon, it&apos;s on people&apos;s lips, spreadin&apos; like a rash on a lizard&apos;s tush-scales!
Peace. Peace at last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the end of one chapter, but the start of another. I shall see my library. I shall walk its halls once more.
Here - take this amulet and fill it with Source. When you&apos;ve done that, return to me, and I&apos;ll tell you what must be done next.
*You feel weightless, as if lifted by a silent wind. For just a moment, your mind is free of wonder and worry...*
Look! It&apos;s Saheila...
Spun from the finest yarn, this mantle was designed to protect the wearer without impeding movement.
Open
Face the demon. Face Adramahlihk.
Requires [1] [2]&lt;br&gt;
Here it comes!
You! Elf! Over here, damn it!
*Creak*
I know that justice starts with duty. I know that it starts with a code.
Stun targets in a [2] radius and deal [1] to them. Creates a small ice field with a [3] radius.
Gifted Leggings
There is great power in names. Just like Source is the language of creation, a demon&apos;s true name is the core of its existence. Its be-all... or end-all.
*The spirit does not respond to your presence.*
*Show Exter the Purging Wand, and tell him you are prepared to take care of the Shriekers.*
Griff worked so hard to educate our kids. Then the Magisters dragged him away, the bastards. School&apos;s just a drug den now. Gods-damned tragedy.
*Shrug and say that she&apos;d better bring you to the dungeons.*
*The chicken turns to run in a flurry of spectral feathers, but it&apos;s too late. It&apos;s far, far too late.*
*A dagger of pain shoots through your head, halting your advance instantly.*
*Take a look at what he has to offer.*
You wear my armour. Give - &lt;i&gt;now!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And we don&apos;t live in a civilised world. Well, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; don&apos;t anyway. Queen Justinia understands that. She gave me orders for the Deathfog Delivery Device... can&apos;t say much more than that to you.
...and now we learn it also birthed something awful. Something that plagues every corner of the world.
Now let&apos;s see how quick I can tell you the rest. Queen Justinia&apos;s ordered some dwarf named Lohar to ambush a ship called the Peacemaker and take its cargo. Whatever&apos;s on it, she&apos;s using it against the rebels. She calls it &apos;Operation Downfall&apos;. Pretty ominous, eh?
[VILLAIN] *Bite your lip until a drop of blood seeps out. How about a poem? On the house, of course.*
*Confront her about Kemm&apos;s painting. You know she has it!*
Have it your way, then!
The Divine cared nothing for me, or for the elves. I was just a pawn. If Alexandar still lives... that son of the Void&apos;s going to wish I&apos;d truly killed him the first time.
Yes. Very good.
Ill-Tempered Door
*Tell her you know her better than that. Is she struggling with the demon?*
Sir Yusuf the loyal
Huge Poison Vial
*The vines are losing their colour, the verdant green fading to a sickly yellow.*
*Once, this was a shop. When the going got tough, the tough went shopping.*
Magister Farray
Let it speak! Tell us, what news? Does Braccus still sit on the throne? What ruin has he brought to the land?
Bull Horns
There could be mighty power within a phoenix egg... especially if eaten...
You&apos;re the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell her you&apos;ll take that drink.*
*Note that the cat has remarkable loyalty, even beyond death.*
*Say that you value being &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt; quite a bit.*
Town Bully
*Tell him &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; would never be corrupted by power.*
You are under arrest!
They call you a savage, an animal. They don&apos;t know what it&apos;s like to need to fight, tooth and claw, just to survive. You do.
Numpad Divide
Well don&apos;t just stand there gawking like an ape at an abacus! I already told you I&apos;m a prince. Do you really mean to tell me &lt;i&gt;you don&apos;t know who I am?&lt;/i&gt;
It was just here. It was just right here...
Listen
We made it to the middle deck. The ship is badly damaged. We have to keep moving.
A safe bag for all your keys.
*The man holds a hand to his cheek for a moment. He turns from you, lines up another nail, and hammers it into the panel.*
Do what you like. You do not find them. Not from me.
*Beast&apos;s bow is too deep and his flourish too flamboyant for you to mistake him as sincere. He then turns away to continue inspecting his whiskers.*
Slippery Voidling
*Ask if he&apos;s stumbled upon anything resembling a tablet.*
*Say you&apos;re in need of a Cleric - someone who can heal and support your team.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_5_8860ed48-ba5f-4b7b-82bf-f1220f967d41] gold)
*The visions fade to black, but the memories remain...*
*He quickly quiets, wipes his face, and raises his head.*
I&apos;ll spare you this time, beast! But don&apos;t cross me again! Ever! Hee!
I can be a charmer when I want to be. As well you know...
*Scowl and retort that you hope whatever he unearthed was worth the suffering.*
*First divinity, now dragons. Say there are a frightful amount of people with rather high expectations of you.*
You...
This unjust world claims another victim.
Good. Keep it that way.
Ryker languished in his graveyard mansion. As the world prospered, the number of spirits available to serve him would dwindle. Ryker faded first into obscurity, then non-existence.
Perhaps not, but please, be vigilant. The forces of the Void are on the move. They found me and they search for you.
Shht! You &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; escape. Don&apos;t you know what&apos;s outside the Fort?
Turn Into a Human
*Say that you put great stock in due process actually.*
*Ask if she truly wants to die over a few coins.*
Hold on - what are you doing?
Yes! I&apos;m his grand-daughter. My sisters and I followed in his footsteps. We set up a business making our own magical trinkets and travelling to sell them.
You&apos;ll be glad I do. You can hang your hat on that.
Now, let&apos;s move on to Deathfog. Live or die, you&apos;ve already proven most... well, I was going to say &apos;useful&apos;, but perhaps &apos;entertaining&apos; is the better word.
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck!
This bow&apos;s slender frame belies the craftsmanship in every curve and facet. Near the base, in an intricate pattern, the initials &apos;CD&apos; are burned with needle-fine precision.
A spell most terrible...
Release? What purpose would that serve? We are bound to this armour in the Devourer&apos;s name.
