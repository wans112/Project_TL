So fret not, revel in the promise of the lake! Even without my guidance you have become a true Master of the Source. You are ready. I will guide you to the Well of Ascension, but first I have more to teach you...
Black Ring Reaver
*Snort* Squeeeeeeeee!
*Claim you want an executioner - someone who can deal a lot of damage, up close and personal. A Knight would fit the bill.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_3_01f129ea-b4dc-44b6-8154-9a948f876a82] gold)
Like I was - once. The girl with the night-sky eyes. You the boy with the sunset skin.
Thanks again, stranger! You made my day.
Light Punchers
Or what&apos;s left of the Lord Dread.
Can you feel it? Can you feel the darkness approaching?

*Ask her if she&apos;s alright.*
All this because he wanted to break the covenant. Knew of a way. Some tablet in a cave. There.
I am not here to bandy words with you, boy.
*And he can&apos;t perform this &apos;service&apos; himself? Ask why he needs you.*
*Take him at his word. Then tell him you killed his comrades and by rights should kill him too.*
Stun targets in a [2] radius and deal [1] to them. Creates a small water surface with a [3] radius.
Now, I&apos;ve got a coward to catch. Excuse me.
*She casts her gaze around, taking in the streaming, bluish ether. She breathes a deep, ragged breath.*
You&apos;re free to go. But stay out of trouble. You look like someone who knows how to get into some.
The temple must hold. The temple must - wait, what?
|[1] succumbed to sulfur.|
*Point an accusing finger. He intended to leave his daughter... nothing?*
Body Armour
You look scared. Why are you scared? The gods are indisposed. This is our hour.
*Tell the girl that you have a new name for her.*
Dammit! I hope you&apos;re happy. What was the point of that?
*Say that you&apos;re only in a hurry because Braccus Rex is such an unforgiving master - you don&apos;t want to incur his wrath.*
*As she reaches for you, her hand passes right through your arm. She shrieks, horror animating her face.*
*Call out to her: WAKE UP!*
The younger the meat, the purer the power.
But- but- you wouldn&apos;t! Please, no! If the Magisters find me we&apos;ll &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;regret it.
*Say that you intend to help the fugitive in questions. Which would seriously annoy the Magisters...*
That&apos;s privileged information. I have a trade to protect.
*Say that you heard rumours of a woman named Dorotya who may be involved in the disappearances of the Magisters.*
*Under her breath she incants a simple spell. No sooner does a portal open beside her than she steps into it... and is gone.*
You see? Even the bark-brained elves have heard of me! They know that no other weapon could stand against mine.
Some people have all the bad luck.
*With a polite gesture the Dreamer bids you make yourself comfortable. Wine and delicacies await.*
Because I have no race of my own. No mortal voices begging that they be raised above all others. And no link to a world that is ever more tainted by the Void.
Just keep &lt;i&gt;dreaming,&lt;/i&gt; Your Highness. That is all you truly need to know...
*Ask him what he wants.*
Yep yep.
That&apos;s a good word for it.
[1] Water Damage
I prefer action to dreams, my dear. The Void cannot be turned back on the power of wishes.
Well - I won&apos;t lie and say I&apos;m not disappointed. But it&apos;s no trouble, chief. The heart wants what it wants. Let&apos;s go.
Spirit of the Last Forest Tiger
*Say you don&apos;t feel at all that your characters are developing.*
*The fire is not subdued so easily. It pushes in from all sides, a devastating press of heat and ash.*
*Dash over and grab Lohse. Too late? Too late for what?*
*Tell him the tree sent you here for vengeance. When he cut it down, he stole its life and separated it from its child.*
Goodly doing!
Oh, Godwoken - such a pleasure! Did you miss me? Wait. Don&apos;t answer that. Of&lt;i&gt; course &lt;/i&gt;you did.
You ask for it!
*You feel pity for the tormented soul and offer to help him get his revenge.*
*Confront Isbeil. You know she&apos;s with the Black Ring!*
Let me tell you a little story:
Don&apos;t let them find me! I won&apos;t let them take me. I won&apos;t let them drag me away!
I know what I fight for. Do you?
Plate Scraps
White Magister&apos;s Key
*Pet the dog.*
Find a way to open the door.
*Back away.*
*Undress him in turn.*
*Say you know Isbeil works for the God King - and you mean to stop her.*
Looking for a good time, mate? Head downstairs in the Black Bull tavern - tell the lummox blocking the way that Blaithin gave you a tip-off.
Natalie Bromhead
Well. It&apos;ll have t&apos;do. I always preferred a starlit beach, m&apos;self. You prob&apos;ly figured ol&apos; Beast here to be, well, a beast about... this. But I ain&apos;t had much time for tenderness these last few years.
&lt;i&gt;AAAAHHH...&lt;/i&gt;
You... you do what?! And you have no information for me - who orders the deaths of Scions, who pays Roost?! The flesh is my last hope! OUR last hope!
Zincite
Ancient Altar
You&apos;ll be pardoning me. Very much to do around here, isn&apos;t there. Yes, very much. So very much, and my Conway&apos;s gone away from me...
Do us all a favour and go &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt;.
I thank yow kindly, mistress. Now, thralls... &lt;i&gt;get yow to it!&lt;/i&gt;
Dammit. Dammit, Justinia. What. The hell. &lt;i&gt;Happened&lt;/i&gt; to you?

We healed Klaud.

*A jolting sensation pierces your heart. As the shock fades, you realise you&apos;ve absorbed a modicum of Source, seemingly from the air around you.*
*You want to know your future.*
All along, Dallis has been allied with Lucian the Divine. The Godwoken were pawns for Dallis and Lucian to sacrifice in order to save the world.
Starboard Stateroom Door
The Magisters kept records of each and every Sourcerer in the area - the good, the bad, and the dangerously insane. You have the privilege of seeking out the third of those.
*Tell her not to be too greedy. You need all the Source you can get if you are to reach your potential.*
*SNARL!* GO!
Amadeus&apos; Unending Wine Bottle
You have put your trust in me - and so I will put my trust in you. I&apos;ll gather the Seekers and we&apos;ll meet you near shore. But I implore you to find a way to squelch the Shriekers. Our lives depend on it.
What is this senseless braying? I speak of no beast king - I speak only of &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;King. The Eternal king of creation. The King against whom the Seven lords rebelled.
Careful, Sourcerer. The reddish flesh-beasts here won&apos;t hesitate to string you up by your tail...
Sure thing &apos;Evil One&apos;, sure thing.
*Say you guess so. You wish her luck, though.*
*Tell him you discovered that the caravan was waylaid by dwarven marauders.*
*Tell him you&apos;re no-one special.*
*Raise your eyebrows as if to say &apos;what are you going to do about it?&apos;*
Pirate Booty
What a shame, she handled a blade better than any of us. She would have been useful.
The fiend is... is gone, then? Glory to the stars. My soul... no longer his to imprison.
Despite his innocence, the manhunt for Higba goes on. He&apos;s a Sourcerer, after all.
*Bow to Sir Lora and explain that it&apos;s been an honour - if he ever needs your help again, he&apos;s welcome to ask.*&lt;br&gt;
Kniles&apos; Journal
*Say you&apos;re not sure. You&apos;ve met Magisters before, and you&apos;re not exactly eager to meet more.*
*Tell him that you encountered no living Magister - only their remains.*
A man needs focus in life. Purpose.
What the hell - we&apos;re trapped!
Get yourself geared up!
One more thing. Like I said, Mordus is a Sourcerer. Maybe even one of the ones Siva&apos;s after.
*Allow the spirit of the dead lizard Magister to feel your memory of Magister Borris...*
&lt;i&gt;Magnificent.&lt;/i&gt;
Duna actually lived right alongside the dwarves for centuries - did you know that? It must have been inspiring... no wonder they managed to build such an empire back then.
This tatty parchment is barely legible beneath dark stains of demonic blood and ichor.
*No expression passes Jahan&apos;s face. He nods.*
Erratic Wisp Scroll
We approached the Well of Ascension, but Sebille asked that we first face her former master.
*Protest. Is she sure it was Jonathan she saw?*
I didn&apos;t always work here, stranger. You&apos;re a dwarf - you should know better than to underestimate your own kin!
Feats of the Four
*You recognise the design. The pedestal is from your own era, made by your own people. Empty now, it once supported something powerful. Something now missing.*
I&apos;m sure glad you went back to save the others. Saw one of &apos;em wringing out their tunic at the shore a few hours ago. Say hi for me!
Ascension! Ah! Just the word! Just the thing the visions show me over and over, spinning like a windmill, incessantly!
Spending points on &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Combat Abilities&lt;/font&gt; generally increases the damage you do in the skill &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;schools&lt;/font&gt; you invest in. However there are other benefits as well, read the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;descriptions&lt;/font&gt; of the skill schools to fully understand what the invested points do.
...No, of course it knows that already, Quercus. Yes - yes, I&apos;m aware it&apos;s the entire basis of our partnership.
In order to ascend to Divinity, we&apos;ll need all our Source powers. We still have work to do.
Let me tell you, it was once majestic here. But recently, some &lt;i&gt;bad elements&lt;/i&gt; have been appearing.
Spider Talk
*Quickly undo her binds. You should get out of here before more Lone Wolves show up.*
I am a succubus. Love is my power; it enthralls those who I seduce and feeds me yet more power. It is through this aspect of myself that I must reward you...
Bellwick! I need - oh... I forgot...
*Smile and reach out a hand to shake his.*
*Say you&apos;re pretty much perfect as it is. What more could there be?*
What is this... noooOOOO!
(But what if &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;finds out?!)
You&apos;re in no position to give me orders. I answer directly to Queen Justinia herself!
The God King came to me in a dream - *wheeze*- in a snake&apos;s form.
Short Sword
This spirit... It beckons to me! A lone witness to the carnage that must have happened here. I must speak with it. There is an urgency in its bearing that cannot be denied.
Take care. I doubt this is &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; the city you were expecting to find...
*Wonder what he thinks of the new Divine.*
*With a blast the heat surrounds you. The hair on your forearm shrivels and dies. Flames dance across your vision... and the screaming... the screaming seems to fill your very existence...*
*He narrows his eyes, yet doesn&apos;t say anything.*
[UNDEAD] *Remark that he doesn&apos;t seem all that alarmed to find himself facing an undead.*
I had hoped they would be spared from its ravages, but alas the other six were too close to their creations.
Dead Dwarven Ranger
Magisters&apos; Mottos
Do as I ask, and you&apos;ll be amply rewarded- I guarantee you.
*Skin sloughs from the nose onto your nail.*
