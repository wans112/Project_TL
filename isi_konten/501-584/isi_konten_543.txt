Well observed... but I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s cinnamon. A secret of my cooking... one of them. Now if there&apos;s nothing else, I truly must get back to work...
Away from me, demon slave.
&lt;i&gt;Shed your shadows and own your selfhood, beast! Your lips may... not... lie!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;She has nobody. Only us.&lt;/b&gt;
Nemesis Mindflayer
B... Buddy?
Mmmmmm! mmMMMM!
Yit Ydra
Well, ain&apos;t you a tall drink of tallness. What can I do for you, honey?
Cup of Tea
But... but Samadel... what will we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; without him?
*Ask where he found that scroll.*
I suppose this whole situation is proof that we&apos;ve got really bad taste in friends.
Pedestal
*Chuckle and tell him you&apos;re enjoying it too.*
As you eat our souls one by one, the dragon&apos;s magnificence will be unleashed! We will be unified in flesh and steel.
Rewards
*Tell her to call you a human once more and you&apos;ll bite her tail off.*
Paladin Champion
Show tutorial boxes
No crime deserves a punishment like this. None! I hope he finds vengeance...
*Clutching the amulet tight in her hand, Leya raises her red eyes to meet yours.*
Marking Wares
[1] Air Damage
Everything grows here. Tall and strong. Join us.
It means that when eventually I die, I&apos;ll become the new Mother Tree as my roots join with those of all other Ancestor Trees all over the world.
I&apos;m not askin&apos; you to risk your life on account of me and my marital woes, but if you fancy a paddle you can go right ahead.
Your chant has no meaning, for you know not of whom you speak. So let us sweep away such ill-starred ignorance, and allow me to enlighten you:
I say let it burn, and let the Magisters burn with it.
*Touch what remains of his soul.*
*Ask if he&apos;s going to hand you over to the very people who could make a killing from killing you.*
There you are. I was just thinking of you.
*Clicky* *Clickety* *Click*
Fancy Feather
*You&apos;re not sure - you&apos;ve been through so much already...*
You ever seen a Voidwoken up close?&lt;i&gt; I &lt;/i&gt;have... barely escaped with my life.
*The demon turns to you. His eyes are terrible and familiar as they burn into yours. This is the monster in the mirror; the demon inside you.*
Whoa... ground&apos;s trembling almost as bad as the Lady Vengeance on rough seas...
I can promise to have your back every step of the way, Claw&apos;s honour.
*Lean in, grab his sleeve, and examine it between your two fingers.*
Be gone. Our journey is at an end. I&apos;ll no longer tolerate your presence so like a pebble in one&apos;s shoe.
Wolf Clan Leader
*Tell him you regret not teaming up with him back in Fort Joy.*
To most, lizards are as exotic and mysterious as the Ancient Empire itself. The outside world knows them as warriors, philosophers and slavers, to be respected... and feared.
I&apos;m so glad you&apos;ve come. Are you here to... *ahem*... water my flowers?
You&apos;ve got all I&apos;m gonna give you. I&apos;ve got to keep &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; for myself, you know!
Grim Axe
Can&apos;t equip wares
Crafting Bible, Part III
*Relax. Fighting will only increase the upcoming agony.*
It&apos;s just that I got angry, it&apos;s just that I got angry and hot-headed, it&apos;s just that I called a flame, it&apos;s just that I didn&apos;t mean it...
*Ask what she&apos;s done with Queen Justinia.*
I found Stingtail, the lizard dreamer.
Ah, don&apos;t mind him. Vik&apos;s just got a bee in his bonnet. And that bee is me.
Only as often as I need his guidance, ancient one.
Alone...
*Say that Lohar won&apos;t be coming. The cave&apos;s overrun with Voidwoken and the spirit is - well, dead.*
*You have what you need to know. Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
Good to meet you, lady. Say, you don&apos;t look all that busy. I could use someone to watch my back, and it looks like you could use someone to watch yours.
These are creatures that grew bored pulling legs off spiders and so moved on to people. &apos;Fun&apos; is not the word I would choose.
No, no. You don&apos;t get it. There&apos;s no blade keen enough to help you in there. They&apos;ve got an undead freak locked up. &lt;i&gt;They say she&apos;s a witch&lt;/i&gt;. I say...
To strike out by yourself in such a place is to sign your own death warrant. Nobody else bears responsibility for this.
No... I see it. The horror. The Void. It&apos;s - it&apos;s here.
Roundwind
Accept
Ah, we all knew you got the contract. So when news arrived about his, um, &apos;untimely passing&apos;... I put two and two together. I may not be as sharp as &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; claws, but I&apos;m no dolt.
[UNDEAD] *Smile in agreement - &apos;far from home&apos;? If only he knew...*
It will be yours, my darling. You are no Eternal, but you are so much more than any mortal.
Well... maybe. We&apos;ll see. But you&apos;d better be good!
The perfidious Lord Kemm is dead. The Doctor will see you now.
New to Arx, elf? It&apos;s quite the sight - even after those bloody Paladins are through with ransacking it.
Ugh. So much for soundin&apos; cool. Never been very good at comin&apos; up with a snappy catchphrase on the spot. Why don&apos;t you give it a try?
Ten spans under, humans slept; Ten spans up the dwarves were kept.&lt;br&gt;Lizards burned in lasting flame; Elven trees toward skies did aim.
I told you earlier I could tell you tales about what it was like to be a prince of the house; tales that would last us a thousand nights. That is true. But I&apos;d much rather speak of the tale we are shaping now.
A magical book that places all items into their corresponding bag when read.
*Ask if she knows what you get from a pampered cow.*
Get lost. AND DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
Delete
Mystical Giant Frost Rune
But there comes a time when a man must choose between his friends and a multi-tentacled, dark-god-worshipping monster.
*Smile and take her in your arms. Tell her you love her.*
Nothing to see here, folks.
Key Force End Turn
I don&apos;t know. Whatever it is, it&apos;s not worth it. Not worth those lives. Not worth this pain.
But none of us will be the one: one of our children instead. A Godwoken like you. I have chosen &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; are to be my champion.
Supply Kit
Really?
*Chuckle and say you can think of no finer delicacy.*
What...? Where are we?
I smell it... I smell the sweet meal you carry. You promised it to &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt; Now give it here, give it now...
*Say you come with no word. You are simply passing through.*
Heretic! Blasphemer! May he trample your soul beneath his boots! May he feed your unfaithful heart to the Void!
*Shake her shoulder. Ask if she&apos;s alright.*
*Ask why she&apos;s so desperate to stay imprisoned here.*
*He stands before you. Kill him.*
In the marshes outside Fort Joy, Zaleskar will give Ifan the weapon for Alexandar&apos;s assassination.
[OUTLAW] *Ask what&apos;s in it for you if you help him.*
Find the Advocate.
*Say you&apos;d like to travel with an Enchanter - someone who can manipulate and weaken your enemies.*
Follow instructions.
Off you go, before you rile me up.
Now if you&apos;ll recall, despite lacking a sense of fashion, as per your own testimony you can cook and groom: two quite indispensable talents.
*Tell her where the barrel is. It&apos;s not your problem; she can deal with it*
Get away! Get- *cough* back! At least wait &apos;til I&apos;ve croaked my- my last if ya want to &lt;i&gt;study &lt;/i&gt;me.
*Nod. Tell him you&apos;re ready to learn the second part of your deal.*
Which of the Magisters are potential allies?
Dead Man
I hear the rumble of water. Nothing more.
Two-Handed Elven Axe
I wonder if the Order meant to sacrifice so many of their own just to keep us imprisoned.
Dead dwarves everywhere. A miracle you and I are still breathin&apos;.
SQUEEAK!
Don&apos;t worry, Quercus. I&apos;m sure he meant that curt nod in a friendly way. You know what giants are like...
Arx is a Magister town. It can go to hell.
...no... no... treacherous Paladins... there can be no divinity in an Order that betrays its own...
Hah. Pleasure, chief. Deal &apos;em up, Topsy.
*She notices your collar and you can see the tension ease out of her martial pose.*
*Ask her if she expected to die like this.*
This journey of ours, this strange and violent pilgrimage, it has... changed some preconceptions.
...there&apos;s nothing left for me now... only to go out with a fight.
Dungeon - Sewer Entrance
*Tell the skeleton that Braccus sits on the throne, but you don&apos;t know any Gratiana.*
*The ghostly stag directs a mournful bellow at you.*
*Shake your head. She thinks it was &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; to ally with the Source King? To steal the Gods&apos; Source?*
*Tell the dog he&apos;s a good boy.*
*&apos;No, I suppose she didn&apos;t,&apos; the woman sighs, stepping towards you.*
I had to end myself, Godwoken. Death was the only salve for the madness foisted upon me.
Hungry Flower
Poor lad hasn&apos;t been able to fly properly in months. Lord Kemm feeds him too many treats. And who am I to stop him?
*Envisage yourself a Lone Wolf, paid to do the Sallow Man&apos;s bidding.*
That red-cheeked refusal tells me more than licking you would.
You know what I mean, you freak! Now leave me be - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
You! You denied my freedom, denied my hunger!
Insufferably stupid. As if there was any doubt. *Groan* It was obvious, Godwoken.
*Say that you heard rumours of a woman named Dorotya who may be involved in the disappearances of the Magisters.*
Well, just leave my stuff alone. And crocodiles. I like crocodiles. But I guess you can have the rest.
L3 button
Which means they may still be available for a teaching position...
With many greedy for wealth, power and position,
It&apos;s just, I...
My title is bestowed upon me by the King of All Rats, in honour of my renowned achievements!
Deal with the Magister blockade.
Around here, vandals are put in their rightful place: Prison!
Madam,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cannot help you with this request, despite the sum of gold that you offered. The White Magister is too heavily guarded, and I would have little opportunity to put my skills to use against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would recommend that you leave the region, before he seeks to imperil you further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your humble servant,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R.
Apotheosis Scroll
*She shakes her head.*
Red Prince! Your Majesty! You live! Oh, &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; have I prayed to seven-blessed Zorl-Stissa that she would keep you safe.
Second time&apos;s a charm? Or have I asked too much of you?
*Note that you didn&apos;t accuse her of killing anyone... but she felt the need to deny it anyway...*
Lone Wolves prowl the region.
*Another snap. Different fingers; different sound. You look to the ground? You&apos;re... you&apos;re bowing before him!*
*Tell her that&apos;s for the best.*
Town Drunk
&lt;i&gt;Yes, I agree. It is time we dropped our masks.&lt;/i&gt;
*You hear yourself croak out a plea - &lt;i&gt;&apos;please, I don&apos;t know any more&apos;...&lt;/i&gt; a guttural voice responds with a wheezing laugh.*

One moment if you please. You travel with Lohse, so we need to have a word, you and I.
Brand new recipe! Contains no dog&apos;s milk whatsoever!

Ah, gold! The world&apos;s favourite metal. Very well, let&apos;s redistribute some wealth.

Paste
I daren&apos;t attempt the Path of Blood myself. Hopefully my prayers to Lucian will be enough.
A fair price for my silence. Now you go your way, and I&apos;ll go mine.
