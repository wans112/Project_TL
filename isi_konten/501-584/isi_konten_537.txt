I&apos;ll start at the beginning. Me and mine, we move... classified cargo. Take it right off Magister ships and put it into the hands of those that&apos;ll use it rightly.
Worshipper. Acolyte. We can still work on the semantics.
*Say you will remember this kiss.*
Lone Wolf Pigsbane
Let me indulge you with an explanation: Everything I do, I do for a much greater good. The supreme example of this, is you, Sebille.
Calm yourself. Meditate. Don&apos;t acknowledge your own weakness.
*As the black smoke-snake takes over your mouth you feel yourself slipping away. You see a vision; an army of the glorious dead, risen to turn the world to a lifeless waste, and at its head... a God King...*
Impressive weaponry. Might the Magisters anticipate Voidwoken attacks, despite their rules and their collars?
*Say it sounds like he has a case of sour grapes.*
*Say it&apos;s nothing but a common head demon. Tell her not to mind it.*
[SCHOLAR] *Remark that it&apos;s a challenging piece; forcing the viewer&apos;s imagination to fill in the blanks rather than attempting to convey the horrors of war in a more literal fashion.*

so he opened a museum of demonic artefacts.
Step past this point and I will kill you. I &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to kill you. So go on, take that step.
I... I need to rest. You can do this. You are ready. You can finish this now and forever.
*You want to know more about this Empress.*
Then there&apos;s the lever - it requires a great power source. I had one; perhaps its still with my remains. Otherwise, you must scour the island.
Ah yes. Discretion is the soul of valour, as they say. I may have a job for a dwarf of great valour and discretion. Interested?
Little Wing
Lift a finger towards me and this whole room will rise to my defence.
Cluck, cluck, cluck...
Blooms have the coin! Care-taking!
Enrage Skillbook
Regeneration
I simply cannot help you - it would be a terrible breach of Lord Arhu&apos;s confidence. Now if there&apos;s nothing else, farewell.
*Say that you&apos;re willing to do what it takes to ascend. If that is selfish, then so be it.*
Hilarious story! You&apos;ll be laughing all the way to your grave.
Mellow golden fields shine out from this landscape painting, though from the shape of the corn growing you can tell that the aspiring artist never visited the countryside.
Food Crunchy
*Reach out to console him.*
Sarcasm, my girl, is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; one of the Seven.
We&apos;re on duty here. Leave us be.
Make love to me, my prince.

*Agree to do as she asks.*
Thieves? Oh yeah, thieves. Louse-ly thieves. I know &apos;em well. Now where are they? Where are the louse-ly thieves?
Old Johanna was the last. The poor, poor, &lt;i&gt;poor&lt;/i&gt; dear. Had no money, no children - just this  incredible heirloom passed down to her through the generations.
Choosing ignorance over knowledge once again, are we?
A few lizards managed to escape to Kemm&apos;s estate. The rest...
Sewer Grate
A Dreamer passeth by, chased by shadow...
*The reaver sways on to a beat that only she can hear.*
Please. Hurry. Anything you can find out... anything you can do to bring her home... she &lt;i&gt;cannot &lt;/i&gt;be lost.
My... goddess told me the same thing. Of course she did.
*The dwarf&apos;s agony is evident in his wrecked face and figure, but he cannot speak of it: he has only a miniscule flesh-stump in place of a tongue.*
Lizard Consulate
Oh nothing is wrong. Simply... unexpected. The person I met was without doubt a god. At least by your standards.
Elven Mummy
A crusader in Lucian&apos;s army, you lost your faith as war claimed countless innocents. Now, you&apos;re a Lone Wolf mercenary. Your mission? Kill Lucian&apos;s son.
*Lay a warm hand upon the old man&apos;s bone-cold foot.*
Trader Aravae
*Tell him the Dwarf Queen sent you from the Kingdom to verify the quality of his stock, as she seeks one fortunate trader for an all-expenses-paid trip to sell directly to her at the palace.*
Strength: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
*The feeling remains. Gareth motions to you to step onto the boat, and you begin your journey into the unknown.*
*There&apos;s no mistaking it; this is the voice of the demon, the one who&apos;s been haunting your mind for so long now - the one who intends to seize your body, your soul for himself.*
Elven Bow
*Shrug and say he had best remind you of what he knows in that case...*
Next Level [1]: up to [2]kg or [3] total gold value.
Well, this is it, Quercus. Hold on to your tailâ€¦
*Her tail is coiled demurely around her feet, her fingers tented, their tips lightly touching. She looks at you softly, affectionately, and begins to sing.*
In Lucian&apos;s name, will they not clear her body away? She doesn&apos;t deserve this...
Ancestor Tree
Per&apos;aps if those bleedin&apos; dwarves didn&apos;t eat so much...
*Roll your eyes. You didn&apos;t ask for a lecture.*
And even if I had such things, I fear they would have been destroyed centuries ago.
Headwear moulded from dappled, bark-tanned hide. Three words are engraved inside: &apos;Unity is Strength.&apos;
Looks like you&apos;ve got quite a busy little crew already. My instincts tell me to travel with a smaller pack. But, if you happen to &lt;i&gt;lose&lt;/i&gt; one, you know where I am...
*Rub your hands together; feel the power that surges between your palms.*
We can finally get out of here, now that Gareth&apos;s returned...
There has to be something you need me for! Anything but this!
The tribal elves in the Cullwoods may wish to learn what became of Saheila.
He lived for no more than a few decades. Hardly a life at all...
*Tell her she will know when the moment comes.*
Yes? Have you anything to report?
*The long-dead lizard&apos;s visions fade...*
*You remember happier times, when a loyal pet walked by your side.*
But I swore an oath. This oath I defended to my grave... and I will continue to defend it until such time as the gods themselves deem it fit to end my vigil.
Leather Gloves
Don&apos;t you understand? The Wolves know we are here. We cannot enter their base. They slaughter us, and then there is no-one left to do what we must do.
*The drink has barely any effect on you, bar a coldness in your rib-cage and a wetness in your seat.*
*A look of anguish spreads across her face.*
*Before you go, ask Fane if he&apos;d like to come with you. You might get further if you work as a team.*
*You recall Hypos. House of Dreams. The drugs drove him even madder than he already was. &apos;I&apos;m a magpie,&apos; he screamed as he leapt to his death.*
Who we are, what we&apos;ve done... they mean less than nothing, as long as these collars choke us.
How noble. Not altogether bright, but noble all the same.
We&apos;re guarding this house. Wise to stay well back... there&apos;s a bunch of Silent Monks inside who&apos;ve tasted blood today. Already &lt;i&gt;killed&lt;/i&gt; in there, so they did.
*Cries* I was so close...
*She raises her head and peers at you with a smirk.*
Camp Kitchen
I was not born yesterday, Godwoken. In fact, I&apos;m not sure I was &apos;born&apos; at all!
*Laugh. He&apos;d blame Voidwoken for a murder he himself committed?*
Your consulate lies in ruin. Accursed flames lap at every corner. The Paladins are great and faithful warriors, but some tragedies even they can&apos;t undo.
I did what I could. It was not their time, it seems.
Desk
The demon is dead.
*As you watch, the rock wall behind the altar starts to bleed, to dissolve, to evaporate into nothing. After a few moments, it is gone entirely.*
Steam profile error
How about afterwards I give you your money back, if you&apos;re worth it?
Stow your weapons. It&apos;d be best for everyone involved.
I hope to have been of service, my lord!
And once you are strong enough, we must travel to the Well of Ascension. There, you will become even more powerful.
*The chains snake out towards you. They encircle you in a cold embrace. You wish to step towards her and at the same time wish to step away, but you cannot move at all...*
&lt;i&gt;Defiler! You will not sacrifice my blessing at another&apos;s altar.&lt;/i&gt;
Has she once shown that she deserves our pity? It&apos;s all just a trick.&lt;br&gt;
*Hurry things along. &lt;i&gt;Where is the queen?*&lt;/i&gt;
And the tablet also...?
You know full well I am not the only god. You have seen the great war being waged among us. Do not believe for a moment they are not seeking their own champions - perhaps even from among your companions.
Look at the &lt;i&gt;size &lt;/i&gt;of that thing!
*Blood pours out from around the bandage. Magister Siwan reaches out to you, her hand flailing.*
*You&apos;d be happy to offer your services. Ask what&apos;s happening here.*
Given the choice, I&apos;d sooner open my heart and home than keep it closed out of fear and anger. Reckless? Perhaps. But also &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;
The Covenant shall be fulfilled!
Drat.
*The stone warms and warms until it is suddenly too hot to touch, forcing you to remove your hands and step back.*
Um, um, &apos;scuse me, um, Mister Red Lizard... have you seen our ball?
Poor Alexandar. No-one cares whut he does inna woods.
*Hold up your hands to show her you mean no harm. You just want to talk, not fight.*
Wool

Censer
*She flinches at the slightest rustle of wind through the long grass. Terror in her eyes, she stumbles away from you.*
We&apos;ve acquired the Greaves of Contamination.
*Some sights manage to stand out in this temporal kaleidoscope. A dagger... a spirit...*
Rhalic honours his chosen. Were I &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt;, I would be standing by his right-hand side in the Hall of Echoes.
Bookcase
The... the others too? Am I the first to wake? It doesn&apos;t matter, there is no time! You must leave this place, it&apos;s too dangerous!
Justinia returned to her throne. Under her rule, the Dwarven Kingdom prospered, until two years later a jealous lover stabbed her in the heart with a mutton fork.
The sooner we&apos;re done with this mess, the happier I&apos;ll be.
*Arhu barks a mirthless laugh.*
New Save
*Say you do. You know him to be a faithful and respectable man.*
*Hesitate. You&apos;re still not totally convinced you can trust her.*
Select two ingredients
War Owl Whistle
Her information was flawless  as ever. It&apos;s as if Lucian himself whispers in her ear.
Cracks in reality lead you to other times and places: some of the Void, some of the Gods. Your vision is not quite your own, but you can make use of it.
A man like this was promised glory, but given death. The tale of all soldiers...
Lead Saheila to freedom.
Who Am I?
*Sigh* Indeed not.  And ever more difficult when you&apos;ve been purged.  I was a &apos;Master of Source&apos; once, but no longer. The Magisters saw to that.
All too mortal. All too brittle.
*Say you&apos;d like a word with him about Operation Downfall.*
This ethereal morningstar glimmers with Source and shadow. It is capable of piercing the armour of an opponent and sucking their very lifeforce.
Replica of a Human Warship
Thrasher
It&apos;s sad indeed, but we must press on.
Such a bleeding heart. You could have left me here, &lt;i&gt;should &lt;/i&gt;have left me here, but you just couldn&apos;t resist those great big watery puppy-dog eyes, could you? You&apos;re weak. But then...
That&apos;s where they are. I went after my babies, I saw where they went. But they&apos;ve changed so much, so much much much - BACAW! - much.
Another monstrosity. As if Rivellon didn&apos;t already have enough.
*Tell him you regret her death.*

Think me an owl, a wren... a &lt;i&gt;crow?!&lt;/i&gt;
*Leave the cupboard alone.*
