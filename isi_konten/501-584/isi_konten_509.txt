If you ever stumble upon a shrine to her, well, do let me know. Would be nice to return to normality. Or at least, a life with a little less oinking in it.
The battle for Divinity begins. The first Godwoken to the Wellspring wins.
Keep your fingers to yourself. Next time, I&apos;ll take one as a trophy.
*Take your leave.*
*Say you&apos;re glad you met him. Now you know who&apos;s been going after Godwoken.*
Display Case
The Dubious Doctor K.
*He speaks in a frightened whisper.*
Ethereal Storm
*Wonder what she&apos;d say if she saw the two of you together.*
Mystics say the spirit of a stag remains in its antlers until they are burnt to ash. This spirit may be turned to magical purposes.
*Rest your hand on her shoulder and tell her that Gareth is dead.*
What one Godwoken does to another is divine business. It must not be interfered with.
I don&apos;t know you. I don&apos;t. Know anyone.
If these rats kill me, we&apos;re all done for.
Whatever type of companion you need, I can provide.
*You won&apos;t back down. His Source belongs to you.*
It is one thing to ask a person to leave your company, but quite another to keep talking as if they still had any interest in what you had to say.
With a single breath you&apos;ll usher in a new age; a new creed before which all must bow - a dawn of flame!
I do not teach anymore.
*You spy a lizard lady dressed in the royal colours of the House of Law. She nods at you politely, but remains quite silent. You notice her skin is of a bright red colour.*
*Grrr...*
Thought I&apos;d be down fer a poem &apos;bout lizards, but this one&apos;s gettin&apos; on me last nerve. No offence.
*Tell him that elven moon signs are a load of nonsense.*
Well, he&apos;s not here in Fort Joy, I&apos;ll tell you that much.
I know you have all the time in the world, but that may be no more than ten minutes. Speak to Malady at once!
So many left behind... we owe it to them to succeed in our task.
Thief!
Hmm. I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know any... Low-harr, you say?
Releases shards that do [1] and that may break armour, in a radius of [2]!
I told you: I ain&apos;t discussing that matter with strangers!
*Tell him you are a Godwoken indeed. As such, he should be careful about detaining you further.*
*He works on with a grim determination, and does not look up.*
Odd. A chill just rolled up my spine...
All you had to do is say &apos;no&apos;, remember?
Consumed by Deathfog, it was abandoned to the demons and the dead.
You are still here...
Odd place for a rendezvous, I know, but the matter at hand takes precedence over any and all maritime disasters!
I have no more reason to keep my vigil.
I shall fulfill my birthright.&lt;i&gt; I shall ascend and be Divine.&lt;/i&gt;
I see.
*Agree to lure the tinkerer away and kill him once he&apos;s out of town.*
I&apos;ll never get dinner prepared at this rate...
*You hear a strange sound like rusted hinges creaking and air rushing through a tunnel. A hatch appears behind the shrine.*
Planar Gateway Scroll
Bread
Ah, gold! You elves do love anything that sparkles. Very well, let&apos;s redistribute some wealth.
*Offer her a token sum to look the other way.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Ho! Right kind o&apos; ya, m&apos;friend! I&apos;ve grown quite attached to &apos;em over the years. Almost literally in this filthy place! HO!
Divine Order Contract
Hold fast, while you can.

*Shudder in horror. All these souls, all these souls... and Lohse is meant to become one of them.*
The trial of combat has ended - you are victorious. Your prize awaits. Use it wisely, as a true friend of the elves.
*You hear its whispers. &lt;i&gt;&apos;The Masters must teach you, so that you may become a Master in turn.&apos;&lt;/i&gt; And then it is gone.*
[HERO] *Demand he stop the ritual. This potential power isn&apos;t worth a massive soul-sacrifice.*
Suit yourself!
*You want to know about the Divine Order.*
[BARBARIAN] *Tell him to leave you be or you&apos;ll tear his spuds off and gag him with them.*
&lt;i&gt;Merciful Seven, watch over your fallen warriors... usher them onwards, to the Hall of Echoes...&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her that Linder Kemm is dead.*
*Ask who the spirit means.*
I&apos;m Alexandar! You&apos;re the Sourcerer, Mary-Laine.
*You hated your work for the Order. You wanted to be a stonemason, marry the baker; you still dream about it every night.*
Bind New Level
*Thank him for his aid and take your leave.*
It would mean naught while you lie cold.

You were right to stop me. Her complicity in the deaths of thousands has earned her own many times over. But it&apos;s not right for me to take the final cut.
And what kind of Divine was Sebille, as the world battled on?
Arx is waiting, and Dallis, too. Ready?
&lt;i&gt;This &lt;/i&gt;is why I have chosen you. This is why I would not see the Beast crushed by a kraken and swallowed by a tainted sea. Only you and others like you can wield this great power.
Indeed...
This is... a momentous decision. I&apos;m not entirely certain...
Impossible! A holy man such as he could never be a heathen Void-lurer! He was a stranger showing kindness to strangers - exemplifying the teachings of the Divine!
Still opening that mouth of yours, are you? Careful with that; I quite like the look of it.
I must go to them.
Kemm&apos;s Basement
[SEBILLE] *Tell him that unsolicited fingers have the remarkable tendency to break.*
Meistr Siva is dead. We&apos;ll have to figure out another way to ascend to Divinity.
Take care of yourself, you hear? You&apos;re a sweet one.
Of course. The Voidwoken infestation was merely an inconvenient side effect.
Our guests were usually frightened. Shy. Grateful. They never used their Source, so the Voidwoken never came.
Reduces the damage from piercing attacks.
*Wonder why he just doesn&apos;t get it himself.*
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;The Aeteran&apos;? &lt;/i&gt;Wonder what on Rivellon that is.*
Bet we can find a way to slip these collars, while we&apos;re at it.
Well... your search is at an end... apologies if you were expecting a more convivial setting...
*Leave the spirit be.*
Just like a wizard&apos;s hat, this mushroom can hold more within it than meets the untrained eye.
I smell Source in the air. What have you got to say about it?
or was the price of power just something that had to be paid?
The God King no longer grants me his favour. Mask ripped from me and flesh flayed to bone, because the Godwoken&lt;i&gt; still &lt;/i&gt;walks Rivellon.
The only treasure worth digging for: knowledge!
I scratched Stingtail&apos;s name from my arm.
Giant Void Salamander
Ages have passed since I saw your kind last. Red like the red of old. How you fill my heart with pity.
*Squee!* *Oink* *Oink*
AI Personality determines if your hero has an opinion of their own. If you&apos;re not sure, leave it set at &apos;No AI&apos;.
*A pressure builds in your chest. Cold sweat leaks from your pores. And a voice within warns you to leave this spirit unharmed.*
O but now you&apos;ve gone too far. Naught but a name on my skin you will be.
Turn Action Points
Renegade
You think I haven&apos;t tried killing these freaks already? We&apos;re persistent, darling...
Nope! Sorry.
*By all means! Who are you to stand in the way of love?*
&lt;i&gt;For Ifan... I am pained. He was but one more sacrifice that had to be made. One, among many.&lt;/i&gt;
Captain Vonda Ablewether became the world&apos;s foremost expert on the manufacture of compasses. She died peacefully in her sleep at ninety-three, having saved hundreds and thousands of seafarers&apos; lives...
*Alexandar peers intently into your face, recognition widening his eyes.*
Hey! Come and get me, ya overgrown grasshopper!
*Shout that you recognise her - she&apos;s the thief who grabbed something out of your pouch!*
*Say you are indifferent.*
[1] gives you a [2]% movement bonus.
*The stone gargoyle swivels upon the wall to glare at you. Stone eyelids scrape over agate eyes as it blinks and glares at you.*
That&apos;s pretty awesome, if you ask me!
*The jar before you glows with a blue light. Its appearance flickers and changes; it is at once a brightly-coloured motley and then a deep grey.*
*You lean in to see if you can make out anything else - you&apos;ve heard about such devices. The first step in making a shapeshifting mask...*
Purge target character of any intrinsic Source
*Gratiana impatiently grabs your wand. You feel the Source hammering into the metal, which quickly fills with new power.*
Easel
I... yes. Your voice. &lt;i&gt;His &lt;/i&gt;voice. It makes the air-drops quiver. I am called to the Cathedral. I will travel there anon.
*Tell him he&apos;s better off regretting something he did, than something he didn&apos;t do.*
Mordus escaped without teaching us about our Source powers.
Good to go then?
*Meet his smirk with one of your own. Has he ever tangled with a Godwoken?*
*Hold your tongue about the ring you just found, then.*
*She sees you approach and punches her fist in your direction. Her face flushes red. It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; - the one that destroyed the ship to Fort Joy.*
The Ancestor within. Not all die in the war. This one survives the Deathfog - and &lt;i&gt;waits.&lt;/i&gt;
But wherever the artefacts of my people are, I will find them. We have not simply vanished into thin air.
Yes. You have the potential to save all our kind from annihilation.
*A soothing sensation dips and waves through you, entering you from the air itself. As the feeling fades, you realise you&apos;ve become replete with Source.*
*Thank Tir-Cendelius and take your leave.*
Medium Chest
It&apos;s funny, isn&apos;t it. How some pain is so big it just burns you clean from the inside out.
Incurable cases should be handled with the utmost reverence and care. It is no small thing to commit a two souls to the vaults. Yes, two: The possessed AND a priest to watch after them, from this life into the next. Hallowed be those who sacrifice themselves for this holy purpose.
*The Magister guard snorts and sniffles as he sleeps. You&apos;re almost impressed that one man can make such a phlegmy racket.*&lt;br&gt;
*Braccus Rex, for it is he, stares stonily out to sea.*
You admit your sins. You know yourself well. You are open. So too the doors. Braccus Rex the just gives you what you want and more.
*Lower your head and let Kemm do as he must.*
I couldn&apos;t stand behind a braver soldier!
*Roll your eyes. If she doesn&apos;t want to answer she simply shouldn&apos;t answer.*
Knocked Down
The key, of course - the melody that douses the guardian flames and reveals the vaults. I shudder to think what may happen should their captives be freed.
What&apos;s the matter, Red Prince? Afraid the little prince won&apos;t play along?
Let them come, I say. They are easily vanquished.
What are you conspiring about over there? You! Dwarf! What&apos;s your name?
Hot Kettle Fruit
Is this where the flying Voidwoken took those poor souls from the beach?
*Chitter*
Curious Gauntlets
*Drop Alexandar&apos;s severed head in the bloody hollow.*
Resolve the intrigue.
Your kind may be older than ours, but I don&apos;t think even the Ancients will outlast the Void. We are unprotected, you know. We are all alone...
Let&apos;s see what spirits haunt this garden.
Dallis killed Alexandar, destroyed the Wellspring, and fled.
*He presses his palm harder against your head;  you&apos;re immobilised; you&apos;re in pain.*
