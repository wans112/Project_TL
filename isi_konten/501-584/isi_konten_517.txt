&lt;i&gt;A phoenix...? &lt;/i&gt;Cut back on whatever you&apos;re drinking - I&apos;m in no mood to be made fun of. Not in this condition. I&apos;d know if I was a phoenix!
We are no fools... but... the Divine protects the realm at &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;costs, no matter how high. What price all of Rivellon against just one portion? Any Divine would do the same... if it meant saving &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
Mission or no - the Voidwoken do not care what brings you here.
I am an assassin of ants and crucifier of crickets. All rodents bow before me. So do lesser beasts. Like elves, for instance.
*...but he reneges. You are dead. You are undone.*
Pfft. Demon&apos;s aren&apos;t as tough as they seem. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; in the process of scaring one out of  house and home.
Dwarven wedding interrupted by Voidwoken! Brave dwarves party on!
Good. I was about to marvel at your stupidity, but you&apos;ve quite spared yourelf. Now: Carrying on.
This is what it is like to die.
The archaeologist Wulfrum linked the God-pillars to the elements.
*Note that the woman clearly has a... low opinion of the area, and ask why is that.*
To the Elven Temple
*And there it is...*
I know the queen had some goings-on in Driftwood, but that ship has sailed, isn&apos;t it? Hehe. Anyway - she&apos;s got her grimy fingers in enough hotpots that I&apos;m bound t&apos;come across somethin&apos;. And it&apos;ll be good to have y&apos;along, whatever she&apos;s got cookin&apos;.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...
*She raises downcast eyes to meet yours. She holds you gently in her golden gaze.*
Source Amulet
Only thing I&apos;m crawling toward is divinity, you silly little man. And no man can stop me!
Owwww. It &lt;i&gt;hurts&lt;/i&gt;. It HURTS!
*Continue to listen.*
[BARBARIAN] *Offer to tear open his chest so he can watch his heart stop beating.*
*Ask the lizard to tell you more about herself.*
*Nod to the hatch. Is Lohar down there?*
What a cruel joke.
[ELF] *Respond to the guard with a traditional elven greeting, and say that you wish to bear witness to the ritual.*
You have to do what you think is right. But I can&apos;t stand with you to watch it happen.
[Intelligence Check]
Yellow Fabric Dye
An excellent question. As it happens, the other three rebuffed Alexandar&apos;s demands.
*Bow before the Ancestor Tree with tremendous respect. It is one of the few remaining of its kind.*
*Nod enthusiastically. Of course you do! You recall now he&apos;s that famous... king?*
It was a close call. I was on the edge of... of being just like him. Of letting him scar me so badly that even now... even now that I&apos;m myself again, I wouldn&apos;t feel at home.
*After a few moments, the hound relaxes. It gives its tail a quick wag and lowers its nose back to the deck.*
*The heat around you intensifies until you feel like you&apos;re being cooked alive. It sears you to the soul.*
*She stands stock still and looks into your eyes. There is no hint of pleading, no cries for mercy, just unforgiving judgement. As you consume her spirit, you feel her &lt;i&gt;coldness&lt;/i&gt; seep within you, deep into your bones.*
We found Griff&apos;s crate empty. The contents may yet be nearby.
*Say you&apos;re sorry, but you&apos;re fresh out.*
Running Roots
What word do you bring?
*Ask him what he knows about the fugitive he mentioned before.*
We met an undead being named Zaleskar, who told us of the Seekers. They intend to escape the Reaper&apos;s Eye by taking a Magister flagship, the Lady Vengeance.
The only reason I tolerate your presence is your friendship with His Majesty, the Red Prince. I do not understand it, but it is not &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; place to criticise &lt;i&gt;him.&lt;/i&gt;
No! Please!
&lt;i&gt;The Covenant calls, Divinity falls, the glorious shadow encircles us all.&lt;/i&gt;
Nice. Could I prevail upon you for just one more? Penny for a lost dog, &lt;i&gt;ad infinitarium?&lt;/i&gt;
A parchment scribbled with orders.
*Cough.* O Lucian, please return.
*Accept her decision to stay.*
It&apos;s a practical choice, nothing more.
*Say you have no clue what&apos;s going on.*
*Hand the stolen goods back.*
Now let&apos;s get down to business. All of this talking exhausts me.
So... so you&apos;ll help? You&apos;ll get me out of here?
*Your skull is filled with the scents of home. The sounds of a babbling brook. The feeling of a youth spent playing in the fields...*
Your mum was killed by Voidwoken!
*Ask more about Gareth.*
The dread king is coming... He&apos;s everywhere.
*Two White Magisters are discussing the fate of three magically-bound captives: captives clad in the dark shroud of the Black Ring. Noticing your arrival, the Magisters step back and take hold of their weapons.*
*Unclench your fists and shake out your hands. This anger will not serve you.*
*Gareth&apos;s furious breaths first quicken, then slow. His cheeks go from red to pink. His jaw stays clenched, however. His anger may be diminished, but it hasn&apos;t retreated.*
*The Magister Quartermistress works at her station, kneading dough with her strong, floured hands. Seeing a potential customer, she brightens.*
Shall I take you across the Deathfog lake? I shall! I shall!
Dead Voidwoken lie outside the Ancient Empire consulate in Arx.
You&apos;ve done more than enough.
*With a sigh he turns away to get back to his work, muttering to himself about dogs and horses. You watch him go.*
*The old man looks you up and down and smiles.*
*Wonder if that&apos;s the voice you heard in the ashen vision.*
I waited, yet you never appeared. I hope you have not changed your mind. I am most keen to... satisfy you.
Spirit of Krug the Troll
Robust in design, chainmail armour is a perennial favourite of fighters.
City - Back Alley
I find dignity in other ways. Those who gorge themselves out there call us savages. But I know differently. Now please -
Simple Bow
*Tell him there wasn&apos;t any Deathfog bomb in the cave.*
Dungeon - Empty Room (Square)
*&apos;Excuse me, I couldn&apos;t help but overhear you talking about racing. It&apos;s interesting, because you see I too am a racer. I&apos;m a greyhound, I race for the queen at the track on Fridays!&apos;*
Wait - what? What?! No. No! This was not the deal! THIS WAS NOT THE DEAL! I WILL RETURN! &lt;i&gt;I WILL RETURN!&lt;/i&gt;
You know this will be the end of you, don&apos;t you? You need to destroy the demon&apos;s source of power, or you&apos;ll never be able to withstand him. He&apos;ll consume you, and who knows how many more.
Lay claim to Divinity.
What are you doing, elf? Trying to get the drop on me? Sneak up and slit my throat?!
Oh, dear one. You are no more a schemer than I am a skeleton.
Bogawk! Bock bock bo-GAWK!
Once you have, find me here again. We&apos;ll move forward from there.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;twas then he came to Oram, and slew the seven-headed snake,&lt;br&gt;And seven wives they brought him, for him to leave or take.&lt;/i&gt;
*She pauses, then lowers her voice.*
If we don&apos;t have &lt;i&gt;order &lt;/i&gt;here, we won&apos;t even survive long enough for the Reds to cure us. Surprised you lent a hand. Well done.
My master requires nothing less than the dead Divine lying in its most famous tomb. There is still a wisp of the Seven residing within him. A single wisp separating the rightful King from his Kingdom!
Bless you, poppet. Oh, bless you.
*Tell Jahan the good news: the Advocate is dead. You killed him yourself.*
*Admit it. You are Godwoken.*
*Groan. Her again? Raise your weapon and get it over with.*
*Grunt*
I&apos;m the last merchant &apos;til inside the city gates - get what you need or you&apos;ll regret it!
[RED PRINCE] *Tell him that in your heart of hearts you long for another. This doesn&apos;t feel right.*
I am the Devourer. I cannot be defied!
Bishop Alexandar and the others might still be out there - I need to find them. What do you say?
*Tell her you met the demonologist she mentioned. Jahan, right?*
Quick now, quickly. Do you support Divine Order or Black Ring?
but no ally strong enough to call upon.
I - oh. I see...
Ok. I don&apos;t.
The butcher&apos;s in the ruins - beyond the Shriekers. And he&apos;s not alone, as well he wouldn&apos;t be. The Order keeps its Godwoken leashed.
*Ask how she was hurt.*
*You remain twenty silent steps behind her as she flees into the consulate garden, where a shimmering portal of opal and pearl illuminates the pool beneath. Finally, the opportunity has come; she is as good as dead.*
Loot
Let me get a good look at you. You&apos;re ok?
Paradise awaits, my friend!
Those words were your last, elf.
Friend of yours, elf? Ah wait. You&apos;re &lt;i&gt;blind,&lt;/i&gt; ain&apos;t ya.
[MYSTIC] *Tell her that it&apos;s not like it&apos;s easy to just open up channels to the Source.*
Speaking of loyalty, here&apos;s a little incentive to keep up the good work. Don&apos;t you let up now, you hear? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_2_463b0f43-5410-412d-aba3-875cf81c38ca])
*Take a step back.*
Stairs
*Note that you did your best... you should still be entitled to some sort of reward...*
Cavern Blue
Find her heart and destroy it. Set yourself free, Sebille. &lt;i&gt;Set us all free!&lt;/i&gt;
*Hold up a hand to stop him. You don&apos;t want him intimidating anyone on your watch.*
Ssso. You ssspeak the truth. You passss. The Sssallow Man will want to ssspeak with you, to tell how you how to ssserve. Take thisss...
*Ask her what she&apos;ll do now.*
Where is the feed you promised me?
*Point out that lizards reigned over Rivellon for a millennia before humanity even existed.*
Did you bring back the ancestor trees?
*Inform Gareth you already have a weapon: a helm that can destroy Shriekers.*
*The deep bow doesn&apos;t falter. She locks her eyes with yours and smiles.*
Hmm - I figured I&apos;d be a Silent Monk by now. Not that I&apos;m complaining.
It shouldn&apos;t leave so quickly, Quercus. There&apos;s still work to be done.

Nip neep!
Once per combat, if an enemy lands a fatal blow, [1] will help you bounce back to life with [2]% health. If you die and are resurrected in combat, [1] will be available again.
Huwbert&apos;s Encyclopedia Vol. 18: Roguery
I know you! I heard you sing once. Before. Out &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;. Wow!
But know that I, like you, will do all in my power to find your way home once more - unto the very throne!
*Consume the spirit&apos;s Source.*
I had my reasons. And my methods are my own. You&apos;re better off not knowing.
The Black Ring&apos;s operatin&apos; from right in Justinia&apos;s court. Their spy&apos;s been bendin&apos; her ear, drivin&apos; the strife. She ain&apos;t just workin&apos; for her own gain - but for theirs.
You&apos;re very kind.
*The spirit continues to fire spectral arrows at an unseen foe, cursing at their lack of effect...*
*Grab a rock and smash the lamp to pieces.*
He broke free from Dallis and Vredeman&apos;s influence, and they tried to &lt;i&gt;murder &lt;/i&gt;him for it - them and their White Magisters. Us loyalists had to stand by his side.
*Say you wouldn&apos;t harm him.*
We met a toymaker by the name of Sanders. He uses small amounts of Source to animate puppets. A talented man.
My friend, I consider it my scholarly duty to know what I can of all that lives and... unlives. Surely you of all people understand the quest for knowledge.
They&apos;re after you, you know. You better hide.
That&apos;s a little non-committal... but I&apos;ll take what I can get around here.
*Say it&apos;s not very nice to slight his own kin like that.*
*Rhalic punches you full in the face. You feel a familiar sensation as the delicate bones of your oft-broken nose give way.*
