*Mord&apos;Akaim? Is that what he&apos;s getting for betraying the dwarves?*
*The spirit screams and screams as something unseen tears into him.*
*Squeekeekeek*
Interests a lot of folks. But Lone Wolves - the ones who make it - are different.
*Dying? How curious. Ask what exactly is wrong with her.*
*Kneel down and examine the prone Jimmy.*
*He says nothing in response, and you spin back around to give Beast another piece of your mind. But he is gone - surely called by the same howling seawinds that once brought you together.*
...return it. Home to my brethren...
*There&apos;s another scream - cut short by a wet crunch. The priestess falls backwards, clutching a severed arm in Paladin garb.*
*Ask if you can pet the dog.*
Too bad! Always seemed like a fun crowd to have knockin&apos; &apos;round the ol&apos; noggin.
*It&apos;s time to choose your fate... and the fate of all you hold dear. What shall it be?*
*Express your shock. She killed the bishop. Was she not loyal to him?*
Never pick a fight with your doctor.
Crafting component. Shed by the Vulture on its death. Thereâ€™s something off about it...
Necrofire
*Say you want to talk about the two of you.*
A Fate Worse than Death
Something, indeed! &lt;i&gt;What &lt;/i&gt;thing, experts have yet to conclude. But the thingness of me is most definite.
[MYSTIC] *Claim that you sense a great unhappiness and restlessness in his spirit. There&apos;s somewhere he&apos;d be more appreciated - he should go there.*
*She looks around with a gleam of horror in her eye.*
We pressed Ryker for information, so he attacked us.
Not at all! We all deserve a taste of luxury from time to time, do we not? I may live in a resplendent mansion, but I still &lt;i&gt;share&lt;/i&gt; my riches, one lucky guest at a time. I send an invitation to each citizen at least once a year.
The powers of the Seven went to the God King with my blessing. All will be well in the Void.
[LIZARD] *Bow before her in imperial fashion.*
Unghh...
*Say you think whatever comes out of her &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;hers - no matter who else might influence it.*
*Tell him that&apos;s yet to be determined - but you&apos;re sure he&apos;ll find a proper way to repay your generosity.*
Magister Inquisitor
One of us lost their title and is no longer champion of the arena in Driftwood.
*Whispers* Stay safe, you hear?
&lt;i&gt;YOU!&lt;/i&gt;
I was with you on that ill-fated ship, and might well not have survived, had you not returned to the aid of your fellow passengers down in that dreadful hold.
Can you feel the darkness encroaching?
Yow&apos;re late, bone-bag. The Divine Order pigs be here at the temple. Kill them.
[BEAST] *Tit for tat? Sounds like how you interact with a salesman, not a friend.*
*Your body is overwhelmed by heat as a deep, rumbling growl hits your skull like a hammer.*
*Stay silent and look around, whistling softly. You don&apos;t talk to skulls... people would think you are &lt;i&gt;mad.*&lt;/i&gt;
[BEAST] *Say in the time he&apos;s been trapped, these seas have been &lt;i&gt;yours&lt;/i&gt;.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve had to jump through many a hoop to finally track him down, and princes don&apos;t usually jump through any damn hoops!*
The gods are dead, long live the Godwoken. If the Seven should indeed come to nothing, I&apos;ll be ready to take their place.
See? What did I tell you. &lt;i&gt;Little &lt;/i&gt;gods.
Let&apos;s not turn on each other. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a way for us to do this together, with or without the gods.
*Alexandar&apos;s spirit lets out a sigh - of relief, and a little disappointment.*
Bloodbane
*CHTHCHTH!*
Are you sure you want to publish these items to Steam Workshop [1]:
*Note that if one pays small potatoes, one gets small fries.*
*Say that it means having the power to make the world a better place.*
*Ask what happened to the gods.*
*Declare that you confronted and killed the cook - she left you with no choice.*
*She rests her head in her hands and sobs quietly.*
*Gingerly accept the jerky.*
But yes, I did it. I ushered Braccus Rex, the mad Sourcerer king, back into the land of the living. I hope you&apos;ll admit - that is &lt;i&gt;impressive&lt;/i&gt;.
When Isla&apos;s far from Arx, we can put this dreadful matter behind us.
*Resist. You saw how it consumed the Paladin.*
*Take your leave.*
Lawfulness
[IFAN] *Nod your assent; perhaps with divine powers you could atone for past sins?*
White Wolf Alpha
Heavens to Bessie, another one! More queer folk than commoners in Driftwood these days.
*Demand that the chest open before a prince of the Ancient Empire.*
This one&apos;s my favourite.
Target
*Say that these wounded are all but at the Hall of Echoes already.*
*Promise her that when you are Divine, you shall make sure the forest tigers are restored...*
You must wander far to find more of the armour. Travel to the nameless land and follow the symbols of the dragon worshippers.
Host Online Game
*Say you will go wherever she goes as long as you live.*
*Ask him what he&apos;s guarding.*
A grand altar indeed. Lizard death rites are nothing if not dramatic.
Totems of the Necromancer Scroll
Under the wing of Father Rhalic, all are safe. All can find comfort.
Ryker
Distinctive Puffball
*Tell her you&apos;ve fallen in love with a maniac.*
She is not a figment, my lord. She is fact.
What of them? They have chosen other Godwoken. They chose to reject us - to reject &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.
The island was &apos;raccus Rex&apos;s foundry. He &apos;ade stuff here the likes of which no-one had ever seen. Wea&apos;ons. Swords and stuff. You know.
You would? To walk the earth again would be glorious, but death? Sweet death would be divine...
Overview Map
I... I am healed! Thank you, my friend. I &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;settle this debt.
You! Some cur takes off with my belongings. I must search you!
Isbeil is dead. The Deathfog threat remains, and the mad Queen is still at large.
*Ifan leans back to take in the sight of you. His dark eyes travel over every inch. He reaches out and traces the bow of your lips with his fingers.*
The plunder. The power. The fleeing souls I snared...&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Medical Report
Please, baby... no...
But... you mean it? Well... alright, I suppose. Far be it from me to pester ya.

FreeCamera Increase Height
Let&apos;s go. Redemption&apos;s not won by sitting still...
Not a child. A &lt;i&gt;monster.&lt;/i&gt; He took to the sky as if on wings of pure Source. I might think a wyvern were attacking, had I not seen for myself his raging eyes.
*He crooks his tunic loose and pulls it overhead, revealing his muscular body - all scars and sinew. He grins - &lt;i&gt;eager&lt;/i&gt; - pointed teeth parting, and envelops you completely within his strong arms.*
*Say that you want to know more about who - or what - you&apos;re talking to before you come to a decision.*
*Tell him you hate to break it to him, but people don&apos;t just leave Fort Joy.*
All of existence is a great weave after all. May as well be &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; needle that gives it shape.
*Admit that you don&apos;t have enough money to pay him.*
How dare you stand in our way again?
*Tell her no sacrifice is too great for the greater good.*
*Relent. Tell her to go ahead and talk to Malady.*
Dragon&apos;s Egg
Did you bring back the ancestor trees?
Lovely day for a picnic, isn&apos;t it? The roads may be unsafe, but doesn&apos;t mean we shouldn&apos;t enjoy our pilgrimage to Arx when we can!
*Ask what she was up to while you were cavorting with divinity.*
*Ask what the fare is they are asking for.*
You creatures have spent your lives trudging about this world, and you&apos;ve grown blind to its miracles.
- TITS! Wait. &lt;i&gt;Do you even have tits?&lt;/i&gt;
*The spirit examines her hands, waving them back and forth, seemingly fascinated with the ethereal trail of Source that drifts from them.*
I know.. can you believe it? The Divine&apos;s son, slaughtered like a supper lamb?
Summon Familiar: Cat Scroll
I know. Or did you think I chose you for your sturdy frame alone?
I. Am not. A MISTAKE!
Sadha... Gone. This is all it was: the longing of a lifetime squeezed into a few short moments of confusion, leading to nothing but blood and bereavement.

Armor Chainmail Equip
*Demand to know what&apos;s going on here.*
But not from other Godwoken.
NO! Sourcerer! Stop! Emmie! Me! Alpha! ATTACK!
Notes on Godwoken Ascension
*The presence inside you stirs, pushing you to eat it. &apos;Do not fear,&apos; a voice whispers. &apos;Do what must be done...&apos;*
As it stands though... well... you&apos;ll have to forgo the pleasure.
Beauty Salon
*Lower your head. The spirits tell you he is no child, but a monster.*
That&apos;s the spirit! I&apos;ve been waiting so long to hear -
Back! The armour, it&apos;s trying to take control - it&apos;ll tear you &lt;i&gt;apart.&lt;/i&gt;
Mirrors like his will read your mind and show you what you desire, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; you manage to elude or eliminate him.
Arx fell into decline.
*This isn&apos;t your problem - take your leave.*
Explode
[LOHSE] *Tell him you&apos;re pretty sure some stuff has happened at some point. Some even say it continues to do so.*
...and some without, I would imagine.
The Dreamers though, they&apos;re on my side. And they&apos;ve visions of me on the throne!
Either you&apos;ll do it, or you won&apos;t. You have to choose.
You know, as in &apos;gorilla warfare&apos;? You better take stock of that skeleton of yours, &apos;cause I think your funny bone&apos;s gone missing.
Quite a landing. I should know better by now than to think we&apos;re safe...
*Gareth&apos;s voice softens and the worry lines crisscrossing his forehead relax.*
Seek out our master, he wants you...
*The armour you bear surges with a cold pulse in response, seeking your attention.*
You&apos;re getting the hang of this. Very good.
This is a pleasant game. Of course. Ask away.
*Laugh. That ancient bag of sticks doesn&apos;t scare you.*
You might say the Advocate compared to his master like the pussycat compares to the tiger. It is the tiger I am &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; hunting.
[JESTER] *Deadpan, say the Voidwoken ichor moment was the highlight of your life, not just this journey.*
*You&apos;re in darkness, bar a crack of light. You can feel cold, dead scales against your cheeks, and a colder knot that twists in your stomach as the Magisters hunt for you.*
Speak their words, and you might pass. Consider it a token of my thanks, for the assistance in retrieving Anathema.
*Laugh at their moniker; &lt;i&gt;&apos;Lone Wolves&apos; &lt;/i&gt;is a bit of an oxymoron, no?*
You &apos;itch. You total &apos;itch.
*Ifan shakes his head firmly, not a trace of a smile on his face.*
If his tree may grow, perhaps he may find rest. The shaman knows about these things, not I.
Shall we talk, my friend?
I&apos;m so pleased just to hear he&apos;s walkin&apos; an&apos; talkin&apos;! Ain&apos;t no surprise he&apos;d be sufferin&apos; the blues. But that&apos;d never squash his spirit.
*Wonder if there might be gold, ruby and sapphire somewhere else.*
Should you find any such place, and better yet: proof that Lohar is working on behalf of Queen Justinia, you will be handsomely rewarded, I assure you.
*Recall his earlier words. Who was this &apos;she&apos; giving him his orders?*
Dunno how I&apos;m gonna make this lot stretch the week.
Surrounded by incompetents... I deserve a better posting.
*Express your shock.*
Explodes [1] random arrow(s) or grenade(s) in the target&apos;s inventory.
You dare! You dare touch Master&apos;s gifts! No invitation! Leave now, leave me and Master alone.
*A flash of humanity softens Jonathan&apos;s granite face - but just for a moment. He chuckles, and pokes the inside of his cheek with his tongue.*
