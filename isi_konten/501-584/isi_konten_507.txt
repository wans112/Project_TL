*You feel a strange new power fill your body. The squirrel sits back, sulking, and the cat struts away cheerfully.*
Do I look like an idiot to you? Come on - you just earned yourself a quick ticket to the dungeons. We&apos;ll get a new collar on you soon enough!
I watch you.
The Lady Vengeance
I&apos;ve forgotten &lt;i&gt;nothing. &lt;/i&gt;Alexandar, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the sinner, yet the Gods have allowed &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; to suffer for it. I would kill you a hundred times over if given the chance!
*Leave the shrine be.*
Spirit of Jimmy
Good luck. And do not fail.
Yeah?
*You turn the dial a full rotation without hearing even the &lt;i&gt;slightest&lt;/i&gt; click. The dial spins back to its starting position with a reproachful whirr.*
Don&apos;t pay much attention to camp gossip. Never anything in it.
*Tell him he&apos;s right - he&apos;s better off not knowing. Wink. Turn on your heel. Walk away.*
Bind Existing Level
Move along.
These names... they stir up too many memories. I do not want to think about them now.
*Ask why he would write her own name upon her skin.*
Sure.
As you will. My path is set.
Gods, I was so... young.
*Between the symbols is a remarkably simple answer. A &apos;burning stone&apos; - a rune of fire - must be offered to the dragon.*
You have returned here too early, dear child. I can teach you nothing new until you meet with the Masters!
Weirdos in the cellar chased me away. You believe that? I don&apos;t. And I tried my best purring. And my best miaowing. I even did the slink thing against their legs. No luck.
What&apos;s this I found? Oh, hmm. Never mind. I will be on my way, now!
[JESTER] *Pretend to trip, then wobble back to an upright position, and say you don&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about.*
*As the brother you rescue your sister from the pikes of the royal guard. Together you flee across the sea to the melting pot of Driftwood and Reaper&apos;s Coast. But in Driftwood you visit the lizard...*
*Hold the fumes in your lungs and ignore the thumping in your head.*
Dearest sunshine, I am no witch. I only heal. Body and blood, heart and soul.
Miaow.
I- *urgh*, I had hoped they simply wished to preserve my charm and beauty, but no.
My welcome is yours.
But once we took to the sea together... I couldn&apos;t keep my mind off ya. I ain&apos;t as much a free man as I thought, it turns out.
*Say that they must have loosened him up nicely for you. A little more pressure, and he&apos;s sure to crack... if he forces your hand.*
Lucky you. I guess they don&apos;t care much for the Divine off in the Ancient Empire. Not even your towers will hold off the Voidwoken, though. Nothing can save any of us from them.
*Growling, lunge forward to bite at his face.*
Well. Then you will be the first to die.
Cultist&apos;s Note
Packed full of vegetables and unflavoured broth, this meal is typically served at elven weddings and birthday celebrations.
Psst! Tell me, tell me, tell me... is the sky still blue? It is, isn&apos;t it? I knew it, I knew it. I suppose the sun is still quite orange as well. Ah yes, I remember it well!
Ash Rain Blurry
*He looks around. Then looks at you. And then he smiles. Smiling broadly, Kinnet fades away.*
Locked tight! Surely there&apos;s another skull around here somewhere...
*...you strain to hold onto that one last memory and at last it comes: Tir-Cendelius, Duna, Xantezza, and Amadia, all worshipping the moon.*
...No, never! I will pay it no notice! One of its troupe has an air of nobility about it, but this one?
*The mangled machine sits silent and empty.*
*Glance at the Black Ring banner nearby and ask what&apos;s in the cave.*
Oh. I - of course. Blessings be, sister...
*You exhale the last of the smoke and look around the world with new eyes. Everything glows faintly - you can see Source. You can see the dead!*
R3 button
We don&apos;t live in a civilised world. And we dwarves won&apos;t be living at all unless we do &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. Queen Justinia understands that.
*Perhaps she&apos;s right. Agree to seek out the vault.*
Kamil Stanislaw
Contract
*Spin a yarn about the Voidwoken you killed by the bridge in the dunes near Driftwood.*
We fought in the Arena of the One. But Dallis and Vredeman appeared, seized the powers of the Wellspring, and fled. They must be stopped.
I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing...
Only Ifan himself knows the truth.
And the rest of you have your duties. Move!
*You shake yourself from your sudden nightmare to find the unfamiliar dwarf still standing there. His face betrays both empathy and impatience with your mental flight to the recent past.*
Improve elemental resistances, but movement is slowed. (Toggle Stance)
...but little did we realise, he was &lt;i&gt;poisoning &lt;/i&gt;us.

I&apos;LL SCRUB THOSE BONES UNTIL THEY GLOW LIKE ALABASTER!
Trompdoy was and is a creative man; he knew petty magic in his day, but this he has used to carve this place out from a simple vault. Myself included.
*Murga blanches, jaw hardening as she steps backwards. It &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be just a trick of the light, but it certainly looks like she&apos;s trembling with fear.*

Wish I had time for a victory lap. But we gotta keep movin&apos;. These knots&apos;re not untyin&apos; themselves.
Dead Magister
Corpse of Zaan-dey
So. How do I look?
Combat Examine
I&apos;ve said more than enough. The King soon comes to claim my spirit.
*The squirrel chitters at you angrily and crosses its arms. After a moment&apos;s chittering at the cat it sighs and reaches out to you.*
Say! I don&apos;t know any elvish ditties. Got anything spicy enough to keep my mind off this place for a few bars?
I&apos;ve always preferred to be the one reaping the attention. But you&apos;ve turned the tables. I suppose it&apos;s only right, seeing as how a new Divinity may stand before me.
&lt;i&gt;AND I&apos;M STILL PRAYING!&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m sorry... I can&apos;t help you any more than I can the wounded...
*You get a good look at the hearty fellow, broad as a hull and sunburnt from all sides. His beard is a cascade of meticulous plaits, each one braided through with golden medallions.*
Terrain Transmutation
*You feel a sense of relief wash over you. Of hunger satiated. For now...*
*The creature begins to weep. Fast, silent tears spill from his eyes as he clutches the little cluster of flowers to his heart.*
...thirteen hundred thousand-dozen and fifty-teen gold pieces! Now pay up!
By the Divine, that&apos;s happy news! I&apos;ll be glad to leave this cursed swamp behind.
Lyn and I do thank you. We truly do. The Pryces have lived here for as long as there&apos;ve &lt;i&gt;been &lt;/i&gt;Pryces. Plan to pass the place down to m&apos;boy Gareth one day, if he ever comes home.
Yeah?
We&apos;re striking down the old way of things, and rewriting history.
Healing Potion
*Wink, and say you&apos;re no fugitive... though you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; up for other kinds of trouble.*
The ring&apos;s curse was lifted. I&apos;d best not wear it again.
Godwoken! Have you come to witness the death of the noble coward? How fortunate! You can tell the tale of Lucian&apos;s &lt;i&gt;other &lt;/i&gt;wayward son.
*Choose tails.*
Regret? No. Wish I hadn&apos;t had to? Well... yeah. Of course. Those people were just like me. They got too close to something evil, and they couldn&apos;t keep themselves safe from it.
Here. I bet you know your prickets from your portraits. Wanna trade?
*Deeply asleep now, the man talks no more.*
*Freeze and smile awkardly. You&apos;ve never been good with kids.*
*Tell her that the statue spoke to you, and then there was mist everywhere.*
Air Resistance Potion
A lot of good that does the poor buggers! Hauled off and killed so they can come back as a pigeon or a petunia? Ain&apos;t no fair trade in my book!
Change your mind?
Source Points are currency for certain powerful skills.
*Say that mourning will have to wait. The longer they delay, the more difficult it will become to escape.*
*Nothing happens. Confused, the Scion looks about wildly. Her furious gaze settles on you.*
How curious. It seems that striking bargains with demons does not always turn out well. Who knew...
*The girl claws you away with a screech of outrage.*
Who will you destroy to save the kin?
*Look into the mirror.*
*Did she say &apos;Amadia?&apos; Tell her about the Sanctuary of Amadia.*
*Ask how it plans to retrieve its soul.*
Greet the demon by name - and destroy it. Only then will the Hall welcome me.
You&apos;ve a very active imagination, stranger. &lt;i&gt;Very &lt;/i&gt;active...
Bless the cursed lever.
*The elf stands in front of a cart displaying various sundries. He warmly motions to you and gives you a broad smile.*

GOOD GODS!
I must say, some of your recent actions seem quite bizarre. Even for your species.
Dwarves, elves, lizards, and humans, all became slaves,

Here, take it. That&apos;s the scroll that caused all this. I barely got out of there with my life.
*He seems to be in a hurry. Wonder what he&apos;s running to? Or from?*
As always, there is much to be learned from books. This particular copy, I hope, will not disappoint.
&lt;i&gt;You! Die! RAAAAAARGH!&lt;/i&gt;

Hear this before you leave.
We&apos;ve leapt in lakes and rolled in puddles of blood. M-m-makes no difference!
Hard as nails and twice as chewy, this rare plant thrives on the tears of exhausted adventurers.
Hah. Yes. Not my *wince* finest work. But never you fear: I&apos;ve pulled a clever trick out of my sleeve. The Lady Vengeance stands in two realms at once. Her body here, her soul in the Hall of Echoes. You can return at your leisure.
Hmm, a pyramid? What on Rivellon is this for?
No! I must...
(Don&apos;t mention the rats.)
Stench
Steel your heart. I will be by your side to ensure you do not face the beast alone.
Sourcerer monarchs once performed great deeds across the lands, and in his first days, Braccus did so from the isle he called home. But in time, as is true of so many things, he became increasingly corrupted by Source. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So great was his greed and his fear that crafted a soul forge with his twin, Cassandra. Once the ritual was complete, Braccus turned her into an undead lich so that she, and thus he, might live forever.
There is safety only in silence. I&apos;ve... nothing more to say to you.
FNR!
&lt;i&gt;You chose the wrong prey. Dieee.&lt;/i&gt;
My slave, of course! Oh, but I see. Yes, I suppose it must take some time for the full extent of this honour to sink in.
I see your heart. You want only to help. But if you want to help me, you must go. Alone.
*Ifan growls and presses close to you, so you can feel how very much he wants this. His hot breath warms your face.*
Bad dwarf! You admit it! I have a confession! Mother, I have a confession!
[OUTLAW] *Tell you don&apos;t think he&apos;s being merely callous - he&apos;s &lt;i&gt;up to something&lt;/i&gt;, isn&apos;t he?*
*Ask why he&apos;s looking for such an apparently fearsome creature.*
Keep a sharp eye - once the Seeker&apos;s dead we can follow the cart to the Lady Vengeance.
*Ifan seems amused at the gesture, but he bats your arm down from the salute when the Magister sees what you&apos;re doing.*
*Ask the item if it speaks your own language. What does it mean to tell you?*
Increases Physical Armour by [1] and another [1] for each corpse in the area around you.
