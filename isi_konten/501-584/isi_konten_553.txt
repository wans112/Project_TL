*Ask how you can trust him to hold up his end of the bargain.*
I... I don&apos;t know.
You still stand by me then, despite us being targeted by such a formidable foe? That is quite admirable, I must say.
Ah. Like that. Right, hold on then.
Get lost, before I throw you in a cell for disrespectin&apos; a Magister. Two Magisters. The Magisters.
*Remark on his wish. Is the talent of poetry so important to him?*
Designed for melee mayhem, this spear will pierce your enemies a lot deeper than your witty arguments.
Burrow
Orders for Isbeil
*Ask how Malady saved you from becoming Silent Monks.*
As a rule? No. In my present circumstances? Very much so! Let&apos;s hear it!
*Say that actually, you need to talk to her about something else.*
Many a latest, my friend! The war, the bishop, the queen: what tickles your fancy?
Go!
*Griff? Say you came across him during your days in the Joy...*
Hah! Where&apos;s your Source collar, dog? Though you are a very tall, very... uh... strange-smelling dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
And absolutely nothing else.
*A pained look flashes across the spirit&apos;s face.*
Very well. By all means, milady. Speak!
*Wolf whistles* Lookin&apos; fresh, gorgeous. What I wouldn&apos;t give to climb &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;tree.
Lucian is alive. He and Dallis will purge the world of Source and, with it, seal the veil protecting the planes against the Void.
Help yourself - everything I&apos;ve got&apos;s here.
Not that your story is finished, of course. Sharing your Sourcefull gift may have felt charitable, but not all you meet will beam with gratitude.&lt;br&gt;
Hey! Put your weapons away!
*Four deer stand in formation near a crumbling altar. Three stags, fawn-coloured and hearty, gaze cloudy-eyed at a great, black skeleton, glowing an eerie green.*

After the briefest moment of respite,
*Say this sounds like little more than a shakedown in disguise.*
(Don&apos;t you shush me, Geraldine, I&apos;ll talk to whomever I like.)
Cursing Arrow
Eggy eggy gone gone, baby eggy gone for GOOD!
This meat they give me to cook is tougher than a miner&apos;s boots. I wouldn&apos;t feed it to a dog.
But make no mistake, the Divine has only one duty: to protect this world from the Void.
Searing Daggers Scroll
* - the taste of the food at official receptions, the laughter of children playing out in the gardens, the warm sun on your skin as you walk by the water, the burgeoning sadness as you realise that life is dead...*
Homemade Explosives
Yes, you!
Are you sure?
...or it may not. If the Gods do not choose you to progress, then you&apos;ll likely share my fate - a guardian of this island and its sacred rites.
Prime
Trefawr -&lt;br&gt;I know you like to wag that razoured tongue of yours - but you need to keep yourself in check should Dallis come round. You remember Pryddie? He had a tendency to talk back, just like you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, last time Dallis showed up, she brought that Vredeman character along with her. You know, the creepy fellow that&apos;s been teaching Alexandar? Pryddie just couldn&apos;t keep the jokes to himself, called Vredeman &quot;the Hammer&apos;s hooligan&quot; loud enough for everyone to hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was it. Vredeman snarled, waved his hands about, and Pryddie... burned. From the inside out, until he was melting in blue-hot flames. He screamed to Dallis for mercy, but she just watched, smiling, until he was naught but a pile of smoking ash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s got to be more than just some wizard lackey, Trefawr. He&apos;s so powerful, even the Whites looked terrified when it was all over. So I&apos;m telling you: be on your best behaviour. You don&apos;t want to be Vredeman&apos;s next example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gower
*The spirit shakes her head. It isn&apos;t bare-faced cruelty that crosses her face, but bittersweet. She looks simultaneously indignant, nostalgic and enraged.*
Give the potion to one of the cows.
Not that you will live to see it.
I&apos;d be a fool to not consume such a rare prize.
*She stands up and eyes you coldly.*
I don&apos;t like tests.
I can&apos;t move my legs... they&apos;re freezing up!
*Look to the ground. &apos;Marcus Miles.&apos; You haven&apos;t been called that for some time...*
But running takes you AWAY from trolls! I&apos;ve spent my life - and now my death - getting CLOSER to them. Nothing like some PURPOSE in life!
Favourable Wind
I bet if I could see your face, you&apos;d look incredibly pleased with yourself. But you shouldn&apos;t. You&apos;re too quick to act, too green still. Your bond with the Source may be strengthened, but you are hardly prepared for Divinity.

Better get to it, then. A Magister&apos;ll come find you when they&apos;re ready for you. Could be a while, though. We&apos;re up to our hoods in sinners these days.
*He rolls his neck, aligning spine and skull in a long, crackling chorus.*
*Ask if there&apos;s anything worth taking in the corpse&apos;s pockets.*
*You&apos;re curious. What does he mean?*
*Say you don&apos;t plan to let the Magisters take you anywhere.*

*Enquire about the archives.*
Retreat from me; I may have lost my Source but I can still best a puny human like yourself...
Widely considered a variation on the fare served in the Hall of Echoes, though not even the gods could withstand this much deadly poison.
I should have known you&apos;d put your scaly hide above the lives of everyone around you.
Look it in the eyes... Now do you see? &lt;i&gt;It hungers!&lt;/i&gt; And you&apos;re about to be its first meal... &lt;br&gt;

*Remark that that sounds... dangerous.*
*Shake the melody from your head; you don&apos;t like the way it makes you feel.*
Cluck, cluck, bock!
It sure is good to see ya, kid. Real good.
This dry-as-dust military training book details the under-appreciated field of weapon infusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep within the staccato-like prose, you find useful methods for infusing weapons with the element of fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps more could be gleaned from this tome, but you&apos;d be hard pressed to keep your eyes open long enough to do so.
You&apos;ve discovered a &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;waypoint&lt;/font&gt;. Fleeing combat allows you to escape to any discovered waypoint. You can also quickly travel between waypoints.
An elf collects the wisdom of the ages...
The Magisters can no longer protect us. But I provide the means to protect ourselves.
What price all of Rivellon against just one portion? Any Divine would do the same... if it meant saving &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.
*Ask why they were here in the first place.*
*Consider for a moment. Tell her you aren&apos;t one to tempt the gods. Ask her to leave the party.*
*Tell her she is asking for privileged information.*
It&apos;s the recipe! Now you can make your own whenever you like.
Enforcer
*Ask him what he&apos;s looking for.*
*Offer a demonstration. You could give his arm a lick if he reaches through the bars.*
Find me... embrace me...
*His eyes light up with an avaricious little gleam and he rubs his enormous hands together.*
*Take his hand, but don&apos;t let go. You&apos;ve changed your mind; ask him to stay.*
*Remain calm; tell him you have no idea what he means.*
*Ink fuels the needle&apos;s purpose; this single word fuels yours.*
Godwoken. I see you now. Pray to the altars - don&apos;t let the Void consume the world.

&lt;i&gt;Am I dead? Are you a god...?&lt;/i&gt;
It wasn&apos;t me who caused the Voidwoken to come, I swear it!
*Wonder what he&apos;ll do if he meets the one who sent the message.*
You &lt;i&gt;remember!&lt;/i&gt;
My Source abilities are linked to this aspect of me... and it is through this aspect that I must reward you...
*Say that combat is as confusing as it was in the beginning and is not getting better.*

Teleporter Pyramid can&apos;t be used in a restricted area
Ah, yes. Of course.
*The tinkerer? Yes, tell him that you saw him escape.*
*The guard shifts uncomfortably. He makes to talk... and then stops, unable to find the words. When he does speak, it&apos;s clear that he&apos;s still trying to come to terms with recent events.*
Cage Key
Tovah, her mother, had heard tell of such a place. Its name was &apos;Nemesis&apos;.
*Worriedly ask the child why he&apos;s so frightened of you. What did he see in his mirror?*
I serve Master Fane now.
*Scowl and say you don&apos;t have time for this.*
*Assure the Magister that you&apos;re no Sourcerer. You were wrongly convicted!*
Respect the Reds? &lt;i&gt;Disgraceful&lt;/i&gt;, just like I said! Get out of my face, would ya? I ain&apos;t talking to no damn Reds lover!
*Admit your defeat.*

*Point to the mutilated Paladin. What is going on?*
*A kiss? Ask how that&apos;s supposed to help either one of you.*
*She searches your face for the lie. Doesn&apos;t find it. The compliment touches her. She smiles. Reaches for you...*
Far from it. I am alive, and I walk in my father&apos;s path. Soon I shall fulfill my destiny.
Empty Wand
*He lunges &lt;i&gt;through &lt;/i&gt;you. No impact - just a passing chill, right to the marrow.*
*The skeleton grabs the corpse by the cheeks and pulls hard, grunting in frustration as the body&apos;s skin holds firm.*
*The dwarf puffs up his chest and proudly gestures to the fish.*
&lt;i&gt;Godwoken. Surrender your Source. Surrender your soul.&lt;/i&gt;
Is that so? Perhaps we could find an arrangement that benefits us both.
The &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Attributes&lt;/font&gt; panel shows primary stats on the left and secondary stats on the right. Primary stats have a direct influence on secondary stats.
He&apos;s... he&apos;s alright then, yeah?
*Groan* What was that voice? It wouldn&apos;t stop. It just wouldn&apos;t stop...
By Lucian, Kemm&apos;s an idiot. But he doesn&apos;t want to listen.
Paladin Healer
*Smash the jar under your boot.*
*Say that Lucian has no right to dictate the fate of the world from beyond the grave.*
...you dirty little creep.
Alas, I remain sworn. Yet I take some comfort in knowing that the Black Ring comes for you, Godwoken. The Lone Wolves &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; collect on their contract.
&apos;Fully Possessed&apos;. Not a bad stage name. But actually, it&apos;s Lohse. Pleased to meet you.
*Through the dense fog you hear a voice.*
*Yawns* Calm down, Brianna. Carver&apos;s got his dossier on the Sourcerers.
Go on and have a slice. You deserve a long, long, long rest.
*Produce the cat&apos;s toy ball. Ask her if she&apos;d still love the ball if it stopped being fun to play with.*
*Observe that he&apos;s being cared for by a dwarf and suggest he should be grateful.*

BLAST! Then the hunt continues. Be wary, traveller. Where Septa travels, doom soon follows.
*Wonder if this makes you both targets.*
A malignance more rotten than any I&apos;ve known, sister. It should have been confined to the vaults. I&apos;d have offered myself up for the sacrifice, had I know the doctor&apos;s intentions.
