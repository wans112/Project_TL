When the truth of the Divine&apos;s betrayal was revealed,
*A Sourcerer, a dissolute dwarf with a big mouth, you were thrown in the slammer. Fort Joy beckoned... but you woke up hooded, being dragged through the sewers to a painful end. You never saw the light again.*
Of course! Told ya I would, didn&apos;t I?
Ascendant
A word of warning to you, Sebille, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait  - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
*Her champion? Ask what she wants you to do.*
Soulsapped
Well. But we didn&apos;t know she&apos;d bring those &lt;i&gt;beasts&lt;/i&gt;. We surely didn&apos;t know.
Now move aside. We&apos;ve got business elsewhere.
I&apos;d say your guess is as good as mine, &apos;cept I&apos;ve got the sense not to ask any questions. Now why don&apos;t you waft on, elf? I&apos;ve got work to do.
Hm...
Eternally, the servants toil and sweat...
*She gives you a long look. She would have much to say to you, if it were her place to speak further.*

My word - an actual Eternal memory bank! Damaged, certainly, but I wonder...
*Tell her that Braccus Rex is dead. What does it matter now?*
*As if from nowhere, a sweating warrior appears before you.*
I understand you&apos;ve been very, very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;busy. You&apos;re welcome in my home, in &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;plane, Lohse, but I don&apos;t remember inviting you to my little hideaway among the stars. Who do you think you are?

*Look at her sceptically. What does she want?*
*Tell him you are no Master. But if he wants to eat lords, kings and even the gods themselves... he should come along and dine with you.*
He cut the &apos;oss&apos;s head off and locked it inna chest. &apos;ind you, the &apos;oss was a &apos;ute so couldn&apos;t have talked anyway. The &apos;oss was a &apos;ute. The chief couldn&apos;t talk, I &apos;ean to say.
Don&apos;t get your hopes up. We don&apos;t adopt.

To the victor the spoils. To the victor, divinity.
*Look over his ship and ask him where he&apos;s going.*
You! You travel with the Red Prince! Please do bring him to me, for I long to see him.
The world is without gods. It is a fat-bellied beast, blind and tethered; ripe for Voidwoken teeth.

I landed on Reaper&apos;s Coast. The Lone Wolves who sold me to the Master mentioned this place. That, at least, is a lead.
One of these ingredients does not belong.
*Admit that some things just aren&apos;t known.*
*Tell her you know all about that special night she shared with Magister Borris.*
He can do what he will, but one day his one true name I&apos;ll know, and so undo him.
Dallis and her Magister forces, along with a mysterious acolyte named Vredeman, attacked from the sea.
*You no longer look without, but within. You understand where your path must take you.*
You must leave me be. I can&apos;t let myself be distracted.
Funny lass. Pulling that ol&apos; scheme even in a prison camp. It&apos;s a good thing you didn&apos;t, bub. She would&apos;a robbed you blind.

Magister Yarrow
It&apos;s from Arx that the Divine Order &apos;operates&apos;, so to speak, though you&apos;ll find its operations are as scattered as dandelion seeds in a cyclone. With both factions at odds, Sourcery is not a pervading concern.

*You float back into consciousness. There&apos;s a boulder in your belly and a slug under your skin. Nothing feels right. Nothing feels... whole.*
I intend no harm. I want only some provisions. A bit of bread. A potato or two. Nothing Griff should be loathe to give. I need to escape and I have... people to consider.
Mercy! Mum wasn&apos;t kidding...
*He surveys the area, doing his damnedest not to allow his eyes to rest on you.*
Pity. You should put more stock in dwarves, ya know. They make dependable allies - and formidable enemies...
*Tell him you&apos;ve performed countless exorcisms. You know what to expect, and you won&apos;t fail.*

You held your own out there. Imagine how that might have gone for a meandering schoolkid, or some random merchant.
*You press your palm against the door to open it. Your fingers clack against the wood, and you suddenly feel... &lt;i&gt;grey&lt;/i&gt;. The touch leaves you numb. Dull.*
Not to worry; I haven&apos;t slept a wink since your &lt;i&gt;last &lt;/i&gt;interruption.

The Path and the Pilgrimage&lt;br&gt;By Willam Bradford&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the most faithful will make the expedition - and not all will survive it. But should you wish to travel to the great city of Arx to celebrate the Divine Lucian, I can surely map the safest passage when embarking from the Reaperâ€™s Coast: on foot, from the fishing village of Driftwood, through Paradise Downs, and over the mountains into Arx.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not sail directly into the city. Its harbour will be so lively as to be impenetrable.

Our home is dead and gone. So we join the world, but we should not, for the world kills us. But if we fight not, we lose our scions.
