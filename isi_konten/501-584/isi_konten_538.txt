That&apos;s great, if you ask me! With all this Deathfog floating around, that troll might someday end up being the last living creature out here!
I tried not to see it. I told myself it was fine - that the stronger he became, the stronger I was. What stupid lies...
[NOBLE] *Scoff and say you were merely wandering throughout the Cathedral, and you won&apos;t stand to have some guard level accusations at you.*
We gave those powers up freely to create the first Divine. To bathe in the lake, is to become the Divine.
That&apos;s the bard from Driftwood... looks like his singing days are over.
You&apos;re talking my language! My lips are shut on the matter.
*The spirit nods to you.*
I... I do hope you will do what I could not. I hope you will free that poor soul.
Peep!
It&apos;s wise to &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;quick save&lt;/font&gt; before entering high risk areas. Press [IE_ToggleInGameMenu] to bring up the game menu and select &apos;Quick Save&apos;.
*The voice grows stronger, like the breeze picking up. What were whispers become words.*
*The skeleton pulls a notebook from his robes and starts scribbling. You can hear him muttering something about &apos;highly unorthodox...&apos; &apos;lack of sensation&apos; and &apos;coccyx&apos;.*
*The Magister steps close to you - you can smell his rancid breath on the tip of your tongue.*
You can&apos;t help! No-one can help! If he makes up his mind - nothing can protect you. I can&apos;t tell you.
Torturer
*Garvan kills his mentor and seizes his business. A bridge... ruins... there the deed is done. The murderous weasel did, however, have some skill in trade, and now so do you.*
*Sigh* Useless.
*The chicken pecks at something unseen on the ground before ruffling its feathers and squawking silently.*
Skills
Atusa&apos;s Leg
I will not.
*Relax and let the vision pass.*
It&apos;s rather impressive that a place named &apos;Reaper&apos;s Coast&apos; is even less cheerful than it sounds.
That Murga&apos;s crowed over everyone here for too bloody long... her and that cult of the &apos;One&apos; are bad for business...
*Ask why he doesn&apos;t go collect the bodies of the fallen.*
I owe you, mate! Best of luck!
*Say you need to talk. Lohar sent you.*
Enelrahc the Baleful
So we can&apos;t trust anyone. How is this different to any other day?
&lt;i&gt; . . .&lt;br&gt;T O&lt;br&gt;T H E&lt;br&gt;M O U N T A I N .&lt;/i&gt;
Let&apos;s just see about that.
*Give Tovah a slow nod of respect - you share a memory now.*
*Raise an eyebrow. Surely she doesn&apos;t have stage fright.*
*Eye her with caution. Say you&apos;ve heard of her.*
*Ifan bounds forward and embraces the man, all effusive greetings. As they part, talking animatedly, the man&apos;s beard slips sideways down his face - he&apos;s wearing a disguise! Ifan laughs as he straightens the beard.*
That why you already swore the same to another? I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have pretty good hearing, you know.
Well! Of course he did. Of &lt;i&gt;course &lt;/i&gt;he did. Lemme guess: The sun&apos;s burnt out and the gods are dead too?
*You peer into the mirror and you see Sadha; the memory of sunset prophecy.*
*Say you will not fight your friends and allies.*
*Whispers* I&apos;ll be quiet as a mouse, you bet. Squeak squeak squeak. Hehe. Now go on down. Effie&apos;s Emporium is your bag, for sure.
I... wouldn&apos;t recommend it. I &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;wouldn&apos;t recommend it.
*Beast&apos;s spirit does not acknowledge you as you approach. He only sings - slowly, achingly, sadly.*
If the conspiracy with the Black Ring extends as high as the Hammer herself, she &lt;i&gt;shall &lt;/i&gt;pay the price, I promise you that.
*Sit in the boat and drift.*
How interesting. I can&apos;t find what I look for, but I still find plenty of reason to arrest you!
I have enough of your deceit. Prepare to die!
And feel free to cross this dung-heap... I&apos;m off to sew an armchair out of Marg&apos;s corpse on my New! Improved! Bridge!
Look away from the past and into the future. There is so much work left to do.
The spirit of a thief told us that the Thieves&apos; Guild is somewhere in the sewers. Perhaps the missing painting is there...
This ain&apos;t a game. You survive long enough for the Reds to cure you, or you die along the way. Me, I&apos;d rather see what&apos;s waitin&apos; for me than not see anything at all.
Ah, I was right, then! Off to prison with you.
*On the horizon looms a dark silhouette. As you approach, a beam of light washes the shadow away, revealing to you...*
Holy hells! AHHH! That hurts!
*Get up and get dressed. You&apos;ve so many duties yet to tend to.*
*Say that Kemm loosened him up nicely for you. A little more pressure, and he&apos;s sure to crack... if he forces your hand.*
Cook it. Cut it. Eat it. Die.
*Laugh and tell him he&apos;s quite welcome to follow in your shadow.*
*As you enter the cave, something washes over you: You&apos;ve been here before, and you did something... something terrible. What&apos;s worse, you fled from it.*
I&apos;ve heard that a lot lately. &lt;i&gt;It&apos;s always a lie!&lt;/i&gt;
Cleaver
Shawl
Land ho! The Peacemaker&apos;s headin&apos; for the rocks, Cap&apos;n! We&apos;ll all be drowned! I&apos;m ringin&apos; the bell, Cap&apos;n! Hard a-port, Cap&apos;n! Can ye hear the bell?!
*Tell him you met the ghost of his mentor, Liam. You consumed his essence, but not before learning the truth of how he died.*
He who knows the melody, controls the slave. Whistle, and oh, how they&apos;ll come a-running!
Such hefty volumes these are! I shall need to commission more shelving from the carpenter.
*Ask him what the point of &lt;i&gt;him &lt;/i&gt;is.*
Shocking Touch Skillbook
*Her skin is warm against yours; her breathing a sea that lures. You plunge and sink. You drown in her maelstrom eyes.*
All I know is I were to guard those eggs with my life. And once they cracked open, I was to lay down my weapon and let &apos;em eat me.
Awright?
*The spirit of an emaciated prisoner is staring down at his own corpse. He shakes his head and lets out an exasperated sigh.*
It would, of course, be laughable to even contemplate that emperor could be you. The inference would be you&apos;re worthy of a position higher than a doormat.
[LIZARD] *Clap your palm against your head. This is Horrororsleep. It... isn&apos;t... real!*
Nevertheless... thank you for informing me... I &lt;i&gt;suppose&lt;/i&gt;.
Let&apos;s go, Conway. We&apos;re done with this&apos;n.
*This spirit is as any other - a Source vessel, nothing more. Drain it.*
A child may &lt;i&gt;technically &lt;/i&gt;be alive, but... so is a potato, if you understand me. No, Mody cannot help with what I ask...
You must renounce the Order!
*A fierce dwarven woman appears by your side. She appraises you, unsmiling.*
Why do you fight against an honest gift? A glorious reward awaits, if you follow my guidance.
Of course... but... but I had it just a moment ago. Here in my pocket. Divine above! I&apos;ve lost my baby and her doll as well? What in Lucian&apos;s name is going on...
*Demand to know what kind of cargo he&apos;s talking about.*
*Chuff her on the shoulder and say she&apos;s alright too.*
They was vewy angwy about it! They said mean things about the Meista. An&apos; they left a mess. A big one!
*Peck, peck, peck. The eagle pecks free some choice lump of gristle from deep within the corpse. He swallows it whole, dark blood dripping from his beak and matting the fluffy feathers at his throat.*
Yes. There is nothing more important than a Scion.
*Very well. Pull a blade from your belt and cut yourself so your blood drips into the fawn&apos;s mouth.*
Alexandar&apos;s Journal
Play &apos;em too, of course. Me &apos;n&apos; Laslor were in a band, but we preferred duets. Just us, spreadin&apos; song.

[BARBARIAN] *Push him forward. Better him than you when it comes to these stuffed shirts.*
You&apos;re already connected.

But I am no expert in these matters. The Seekers know more - Gareth spoke of his mission to save the Godwoken Verdas. You would do better to speak to him. If ever he returns...
Really...? &lt;i&gt;Really?!&lt;/i&gt; Better off alone than with- oh very well.
Source-Infused
The Magisters are all I know, all I want! I turned my back on everything else when I joined them - my name, my blood, my history... if I&apos;m not one of them, I&apos;m nothing.
The Watcher
*The Magister&apos;s spirit retains his superior airs, even as he is cursed to oblivion.*
*Squeaaaaaaak?*
*You spot her corpse.*
Your wandering hands buy you time in a prison cell. Come on. Off you go.
Find Malady.
*He turns his face toward you - and roughly wrenches the elf&apos;s jaw toward you as well.*
*Say you&apos;re always on the lookout for further enlightenment.*
Talk with the First Mate&apos;s ghost.
Ah! So it&apos;s dear Prudence who&apos;s responsible for our confusion! Odd. She&apos;s usually as strict as a taxman.
*Candor still thinks he&apos;ll be the next Divine.*
And one thing is certain: &lt;i&gt;it won&apos;t be you.&lt;/i&gt; From the moment I learned you left me to rot on a sinking ship I knew I was following a rat.
She disobeyed orders. She paid the price. I won&apos;t shed tears for some traitor.
Take some Sourcery in the face, nasty Dallis!
*Suggest you earn the championship by battling the Voidwoken instead.*
Dwarven Royal Spear
They would, it&apos;s true. But I happen to be using my head right now, and if you use yours you&apos;ll back the hells off.
Only one way to find out; try using it!
See? I told you I was right.
Wands have &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;special skills&lt;/font&gt; in addition to normal damage types. Check the Wand&apos;s skill in the &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/font&gt; tab of the skill panel. Equipping a wand will automatically assign the skill to your Hotbar.
No melee weapon equipped&lt;br&gt;
Do not fear for his soul - it is unworthy. It is already damned. No power in this world can save it - this is an act of kindness.
&lt;i&gt;Adramahlihk!&lt;/i&gt; Thousand-named nemesis! Lord of Soot, come shake black hands with me! Leave her, leave her, come play with &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt;

*Spit the blood.*
You&apos;re not one of Braccus&apos;s brood? You&apos;re not Gratiana&apos;s pet? Then why do you disturb us?
STAT TYPE CHECK
Maybe I oughta take a finger or two. Don&apos;t you think, boss?
What do you want from me, Marcus? What can I possibly say at this moment, and in this place, to appease you?
My sources tell me she was able to get away from all that... &lt;i&gt;unpleasantness&lt;/i&gt; before it was too late.
*Thank him with a nod.*
&apos;Here lies Farron Harkwood.&lt;br&gt;Daughter of Roland and Prudence.&lt;br&gt;Sister to Amelia, Carlyn, and Kniles.&lt;br&gt;Died of an unexplained illness.&apos;
&lt;i&gt;...she is not your truth... your deep down truth... your terrible inescapable deep down truth... she is a lie... she is a terrible lie...&lt;/i&gt;
Amadia&apos;s grace! Blessings upon this day!
[LIZARD] *Tell him you&apos;re sworn to Zorl-Stissa - and he should be too.*
What do you want, you child.
Hey there, tall, dark, and glower-y. What&apos;s your name?
One day he vanished, and was never seen again.
Smoke Cover Skillbook
*He eyes you with a sudden intensity; makes you feel like a weight upon a scale, balanced against an unknown measure.*
*A severed head on a stick quietly sobs. It looks at you. Brightens visibly.*
*Inform him you don&apos;t have the tablet.*
Someone oughta tell &apos;em it wasn&apos;t the whole Ancient Empire - just one red outcast.
Poisoned Dagger
Do you know, this time we have spent together has been absolutely fascinating!
We lit the torches, but the flames quickly died.
I &lt;i&gt;know. &lt;/i&gt;Your soul is bare, cur. Your sins shine bright. But fear not: your torment is almost at an end.
