*Growl that your patience is at an end. If he wants to end Operation Downfall, he needs to talk. &lt;i&gt;Now.*&lt;/i&gt;
Step away from the prisoner!
*The figure charges you head on, ready to plunge the sword into your chest.*
I hope protecting the realm suits you, too. This place&apos;ll keep you on your toes, but we&apos;re counting on you.
Mortals look at this and think it old. It&apos;s rather adorable, really.
That&apos;s good news. Maybe our hard work wasn&apos;t all for nothing, then. Is there anything I can do to show my thanks?
*Looking down at your robes, you see they&apos;re damp with blood and the ocean&apos;s spray. In the distance, Fort Joy looms.*
Sometimes innocents must die. There&apos;s no avoiding it. At least he&apos;s been released from this prison.
*She reaches out as though to shake your hand but stumbles, falling a little into your arms. She laughs, embarrassed, and quickly rights herself.*
She was... She was here! I only turned away for a moment...
Magister Borris told me to kill the seer Saheila and report back.
&apos;Beast.&apos; An apt word. He took to the sky as if on wings of pure Source. I might think a wyvern were attacking, had I not seen for myself his raging eyes.
Range: [1]&lt;br&gt;Decay makes healing spells and potions do damage on target.
A thief through and through. And as I see it, there are too many thieves on the streets as it is...
Yes, you were! Now git, human!
*Tell her you need to keep moving forward.*
We made it out of the Fort at last. I can&apos;t help but wonder if all those people needed to die, though.
Conjures a trusty personal demon and elemental totems to aid in battle
*You feel a twist in your gut. That can&apos;t happen...*
Decreases the damage from attacks that reduce Magic Armour.
Magical Lizard&apos;s Lance
*Say that you liked that little nickname Callo gave Ifan: &lt;i&gt;Silver Flaw.*&lt;/i&gt;
Time to get this letter t&apos; Lohar, too, I reckon. He&apos;ll want to know what this Mordus is up to.
*Admit that the hallowed walls of the Cathedral bring you a sense of peace in troubled times... but also that you also feel great dread. Ask if this is normal.*
We&apos;ve chased her clear across the country, and she&apos;s left devastation in her wake. We expect a Voidwoken attack here too, at any moment. That, or worse.
Bet you didn&apos;t need to wear a fake beard for it, though. This one itches like a devil...
Pants of Lenience
*Say that as someone who knew her son&apos;s work well, you&apos;d be highly interested in taking a look at his notes and implements.*
Range
Spirit of a Magister Priest
Gotta hand it to ya. You elves sure smell better than us when you die. Kinda like fall leaves, y&apos;know?
Come. Meet my eyes. Dare to look into the sun.
We could help the Magisters defeat the Sourcerer. She does seem dangerous.
I know exactly what must be done! You must find a Master of Source. And I could have helped you once, but no longer.
I can&apos;t imagine anyone more capable. Lucian truly shines his light on you!
*Tell her you need a moment to think.*
Brutality? This isn&apos;t brutality. A rotting limb must be cut off before the infection spreads. This is a &lt;i&gt;cure. &lt;/i&gt;
The dog! The utter SCOUNDREL! Why, I ought to have your head delivered to him by way of reply!
*Say you can&apos;t be sure.*
...you&apos;d prefer death to living with your fatal mistake. I trust you&apos;ll all remember your lost little boy the next time you think of defying the Order.
Attitude [1] [2][3]
That&apos;s always entertaining.
*Put your hand over hers. She&apos;s shaking. Ask her if she&apos;s alright.*
Returning again, weaker-ling? What wanting?
We found Dorian Gall. Micheil Ros wants him dead.
I know this place ain&apos;t exactly cheerful, but y&apos;can&apos;t let &apos;em have your spirit, too!
Even after the maggots took your tongue, you still talk too much. Silence yer jaw!
It was not always thus. This swamp was once a rich, lush land. Before &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;came. Before Braccus.
Will we escape Fort Joy?
A scroll is a one time use spell. Use to start casting!
Wait - what&apos;s this? There&apos;s a note in here...
*Note that he seems to be a skilled craftsman - is there anything he&apos;d be willing to trade?*
*Smile and take her hand. Tell her you&apos;re so grateful to be free.*
P-please, Master Ryker, it was a mistake! I&apos;d never have killed that deer, not if I knew who it belonged to!
Hatch to Fishworks Cellar
A solid and sturdy amulet, safe from nicks and scratches.
*Leave him to his work.*
You have had your wish, Godwoken. We are done here.
[RED PRINCE] *Shake your head and say it saddens you to see a lizard tricked so easily.*
*He smiles.*
Expect the worst. But hope for the best. Always the best.
Indeed? Slayed by your hand, then? The cub once pleaded with me to aid in his Sourcerer pogrom, Fane. I cannot deplore your actions, as loathe as I am to admit it.
We found the Devourer&apos;s legguards and experienced a sharp longing to see a temple high on a cliff.
*This is the Godwoken Raedalus, who fell in love with Taryan. He died at the hand of Lucian.*
[MYSTIC] *Tell him not to worry, there is life after death. Evidently.*
Object repaired by [1]
*The dwarf tries to throw a punch at you, but as its fist passes through your face, you can feel his power filling your body. With a scream, he fades to nothing.*
You again? Had second thoughts about my little offer...?
*Widen your eyes. He mentioned Siva. Is he... Godwoken?*
*You feel suddenly vulnerable. Before you can even speak, you know your facade is broken and your face unmasked...*
I am blessed, soft-slither, by drudanae and divinity. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
No arguments from me there. I&apos;m counting my contract complete.
Whether the chef or Dallis herself are guilty, my orders are to search this factory.
A girl&apos;s wedding should be the happiest day of her life...
*A single sharp claw pierces your soul and twists. Something jagged fills your hand: a potent rune of fire.*
*Say you need out of this dump. You&apos;re a denizen of the oceans, not the underworld.*
And worse - what if you had all that power, but they were not worth saving?
He... is gone. Taken at last by the wicked spirit that consumed him. A tragedy has happened today. A tragedy indeed...
Heartstring
*Scowl and say that you helped the Paladins in their little skirmish just recently - you&apos;re an ally. Whatever happened in here is nothing to do with you.*
Well, I used to be... wait. Who did I used to be?
Accept this gift  from the Mother. It may aid you on your journey. Know that you have an ally in the Mother.
Please, good lady. You must free me! Prise this spear from my chest, where it has been stuck fast the last thousand years.
[ELF] *Scowl at this godless desecration of your people&apos;s customs, and say that it will serve you as you see fit. You will decide its fate later.*
Exploration Theme 01 Light Brass
*Insist she&apos;s but a girl. She shouldn&apos;t be punished for her parents&apos; wrongdoings.*
*Insist she move aside, under Lohar&apos;s orders.*
*Tell her there&apos;s something dwelling within you. Something very powerful. You spoke to it in the Hall of Echoes.*
*Ask him to switch to an original.*
Birds Desert 05
You can find a way across, right? I know you can!
Well if it ain&apos;t so-and-so! Ha - just kiddin&apos;, Ifan. We&apos;re good together, like sea salt &apos;n&apos; taties, or jam on sweetbread. Y&apos;care to team up? I&apos;d say your stew could use a bit of Beastly flavour, if ya catch my meanin&apos;.
Crackling with barely-contained energy, this wand promises all the power of a tempest.
Domesticate your pet, will you? Or I&apos;ll make it wet itself red.
Rhymes Of The Scribes, Part 7
Welcome to the local chat
Dungeon - Throne Room
Wonder what he&apos;d think of his Divine Order now.
I have plans for you, child.
Wait - you might be just the stimulus I needed. I shall craft a rhyme for you and your race. All I ask in return is a handful of coins. It&apos;s an offer of a lifetime!
*The skeleton looks up and notices you for the first time.*
*Console Lohse. She did the right thing; Adramahlihk can&apos;t hurt anyone else now.*
There&apos;s no shortage of sufferin&apos;, that&apos;s fer sher. Maybe I could do me part to help yer... efforts.
The Weaver
I am - &lt;i&gt;was &lt;/i&gt;- a Knight of Rhalic. I was tasked with guarding his presence upon this holy island. Before that, I was the same as you; a Godwoken...
Water attack [T]
Pants of Clemency
Strapping Sabatons
What have I done to deserve this? The pain, the cold... it&apos;s too much! I just want to be warm, warm and &lt;i&gt;rested&lt;/i&gt;.
I&apos;m not sure what this promised future will hold, but I know the past is done.
*Tell her you could stomp her lights out in one blow. She ought to watch her tongue.*
Lucian blesses me in his own way, fresh-pearl. I glide on his breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
Oh, just updating my notes. A lot of them feel rather outdated.
V-V-&lt;i&gt;Voidwoken?&lt;/i&gt; Or whoever&apos;s been &lt;i&gt;disappearing &lt;/i&gt;Magisters. Well, I&apos;ll not be sleeping tonight.
Flaming Spear
*He looks aside and where his eyes lead a second figure appears.*
Gods&lt;i&gt;damn&lt;/i&gt;. What manner of creature lies to a dead man about such a thing?
Fit as a fiddle and *ungh* twice the size.
*One final, harsh breath trickles out from between her lips. She&apos;s gone.*
&lt;b&gt;You will do. Enjoy this last moment before we take you.&lt;/b&gt;
Cat the Appraiser was in Kemm&apos;s mansion, behaving suspiciously.
Micheil Ros is dead.
And with that stunning plot twist, we arrive at the final scene!
Well you smell bad. I don&apos;t trust you. You smell like all the bad things. Go away! Go away go away go away go away go away!
Is this...
*A terrible chill pervades the air as the ashen vision fades. Someone new is watching you.*
*The God King&apos;s voice rises in warning.*
&lt;i&gt;Not one step further&lt;/i&gt;. I know what you want here. But Qanna&apos;s already laid claim to it.
*Tell her you&apos;re far from impressed. After all, her prisoner is about to escape...*
Covered Cupboard
&apos;s mine. Gerroff.
Good luck, Godwoken.
*Alas, you will never know - nor will you know whose sword it was that plunged into your back in that moment. It isn&apos;t the blade&apos;s pain that hurts most, but the pain of the failed assassination that most disturbs you as you slip into darkness...*
Superior Ring
A sophisticated imperial lizard like yourself will surely know that in business there&apos;s a market for everything. You just have to find it. Or...
You won&apos;t come between us again!
The Order came for me. They kept me safe. I am not afraid of Alexandar. I am not afraid of death. But I am afraid of you. Of your kind.
True enough. And that giant lizard must look like a great mutton chop to &apos;em.
We found a large construction designed to prevent progress.
*Gareth&apos;s mind wanders once more. He is no longer engaged with you, but with a past he may never leave behind.*
User Interface
*Say you&apos;ve come for the roses indeed. Ask how many she&apos;s found.*
Sure you would, buck.
*Nod towards the corpse. Anything valuable there?*
*Tell him that is a tremendous responsibility. His responsibility - not yours.*
