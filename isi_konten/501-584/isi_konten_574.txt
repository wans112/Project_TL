...and handing over your divine right to a demon seemed right, did it? I would have thought you&apos;d figured out which evil entities to trust by now.
Curse those masked freaks. Gods-damned Ryker...
*You&apos;ve been meaning to bring up what almost happened between you in the Undertavern...*
Hm. A deal, huh? Well. T&apos;ain&apos;t none of my business. Go on - shoo!
*Geraldine gives you a blank look. She blinks her long, luscious eyelashes. Then remembers she&apos;s supposed to be annoyed with you. She &lt;i&gt;harumphs.*&lt;/i&gt;
She&apos;s weakening. Keep her here.
*He pours a glass of wine from a bottle in his greatcoat and drinks it down in one voracious gulp.*
*You hope this is less... dramatic than the last time. Bow your head in prayer.*
Judging by the smell, the captain must have worn this hat every. Single. Day. Oh boy.
Heh! There&apos;s nothing I want in this place, bub. Nothing but to leave it.

*You have not felt that rush in aeons, but you don&apos;t feel quite right about using the spell...*
*Tell her you&apos;re torn, but that you will do your best to take her methods in stride.*
*Take your leave.*
Oh goodie! You&apos;re a good girl. Yes you are! Who&apos;s a good girl, then? You! That&apos;s who!
*He fidgets awkwardly.*
*Tell him his &apos;Sourcerer&apos; is dead.*

Better to leave those lost souls be. They can&apos;t help us.
Lord Kemm&apos;s Collection Index
Not much, I&apos;ll tell you that. Why, what do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think of them?
Ah, the betrayer.
Become Hasted and then teleport to target position.
But my people were Source too, although we didn&apos;t know it at the time. And our Source helped create you.
What&apos;s your name, again?
But in the end, that is of no consequence. Unite with the Red Princess, and your children will breathe the fires of a second sun that will banish all shadow forever!
Then we shall meet in the great realm of dreams, where the whispers will reach me, and through me, their words will be yours.
Hints and rumours of a dwarven plot point us to Micheil Ros&apos; house.

*Show him how to still the raging waters of his anger. Show him the tide receding to reveal the fear beneath.*
You mean like this?
*The spirit&apos;s memories play out before you in darkest black. The sound alone relates the tale. A self-styled archaeologist (some would call you a grave-robber), you&apos;ve found the grave of Baran Willmart Hogge IV...*
Godsdamned Sourcerers.
Trader Keyren
Yes. Even if it led to my downfall.
*Something shifts within the sculpture, and you&apos;re knocked back by a sudden burst of energy. The glow from the columns surrounding the barrier fades, and the room is still.*
Until she is free of the tyranny of Braccus, her mood will only darken, I fear. Her own courtiers can do little to cheer her, and outsiders... well, outsiders rarely survive her wrath.
*Leave it alone.*
Dome Of Protection
This luxuriant robe smells faintly of expensive perfume and is enriched with careful red and white embroidery in the style of the Divine Order.
Well done. Good to know when a freshie&apos;s got the right frame of mind about these matters.
*Enquire about this place.*
*Say that if she wanted to show her gratitude, she could help you escape this island.*
Spread Your Wings Skillbook
How... how DARE you? You are not fit to consume one like me: a PINNACLE of creation! Time will see me a giant and I will eat ALL on this isle!
*You choke down the raw heart. It seems to &lt;i&gt;warm you&lt;/i&gt;... a fiery intensity flows through your veins... not unpleasant.*
With a lot of skill and a little luck, this rogue sees the world as an open coffer
That I did. Black as a royal heart.
*Shrug. Tell him you were just making conversation.*
*Assure her that you&apos;re trying to help.*
I pray the Seven guide Gwydian to safety.
He has to, indeed. We &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; our leader. And if he doesn&apos;t return with help soon... we haven&apos;t a hope.
Truly? A kind offer indeed. Even if it comes from the very person that left me and others to rot on a sinking ship...
My old pack hold the contract for Godwoken. Which, eh, we are.
*Ask if she knows what it&apos;s like.*
*Step carefully away.*
Right and wrong are meaningless distinctions. Here, only &apos;alive&apos; and &apos;dead&apos; are relevant.
*Not this time. You&apos;d like to do the talking yourself.*
*The Magister looks at you, trying to understand what you&apos;re saying.*
*Ask Ifan if he&apos;s really not going to do any more contracts.*
*Tell Beast you are grateful for his loyalty at the Academy, even if things didn&apos;t go entirely as planned.*
*Tell him you&apos;ll go where you choose.*
*Vent your growing anger. You insist he reveal his secrets to you.*
Adventure calls, but I say we do this again sometime.
*You&apos;re a bit disappointed. Tell her you were hoping this might have been about you.*
*The captain purses his lips and bows, before turning to his troops.*
*Say that you&apos;d very much like to have a word with Lord Kemm himself.*
*The door does not like what it sees in you.*
Go on. Get an eyeful. That&apos;s the least of what happens to traitors. Traitors and Sourcerers.

We gave Radeka&apos;s Purging Wand to Slane, and he transformed into a lizard.
The Adventurer&apos;s Field Guide&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in my days, adventuring was about survival. You made your own food, your own weapons, and you rested under a starry black sky. And if you made your own metal armour and it squeaked a little, you simply used some drops of oil in the right places and you were good to go. Nowadays, you see young guys flaunting the swords they got for their sixteenth birthday, and two days later, they buy a new one. And what good will this consumerism do them? None, I say! I survived out in the wilderness for years with the same equipment, and came back richer! Oh, and I for one DID come back.
*Gareth loses himself in thought - but only for a second. He nods in farewell, leaving you to consider how you might remove your Source collar.*
Girdle
Magical Plate Helmet
[SCHOLAR] *You can&apos;t make out any words, but you recognise some sounds: an elven chirp here, an orcish grunt there. Tell it to wait as you reach for some parchment.*
*He laughs all the louder, trying to drown out the shame. The sickening hilarity of the life he has lost consumes him. But as he faces oblivion, the laughter turns into a scream...*
Good. Now clear orf. Yer in the way.
The agony never stops. Please, end this curse!
Well, if it isn&apos;t the &lt;i&gt;new Divine&lt;/i&gt;, gracing me with his presence. *Smirks* How honoured I am...

Sourcerous Sundries
*Look around the room. Decide to take the risk.*
Nice amulet you&apos;ve got there. Nice and &lt;i&gt;stolen. &lt;/i&gt;Thief!
*...and then with a scratch across your mind, he offers you a deal: the head of Alexandar, cut from his shoulders and brought to him here...*
Take that, Sourcerer! No more saucy Sourcery for you! Alexandar and Dallis save the world again!
Wizard Boots
*Raise it to your lips and blow.*
Heavy and clunky, these platemail gloves would deliver quite the painful uppercut.
One must never enter into any endeavour though, without realising the stakes:
Who are you to judge a soul? You who danced with demons. You who butchered your friends. You whose dreams spill blood. Who are you to judge a soul?
But now that I&apos;m here, it seems there&apos;s only one thing I can do: pray.
*Comment that she speaks very strangely...*
*The tool is broken.*
Obviously. But it must be done, or there will be no stopping Adramahlihk.

Ah, there you are. I&apos;ve been waiting for you.

Go on, my sweet. &lt;i&gt;Devour me!&lt;/i&gt;
Intelligence
I&apos;m heading there now. I suggest you do the same. Good luck. Really.
*Tell her you&apos;ve made some progress, but don&apos;t elaborate.*
Not just &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; mistake. &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; Mistake.
She wasn&apos;t there when Alexandar fell, but White Magister Reimond uncovered the truth. She&apos;s as guilty as any of them, an&apos; I reckon she got off lightly - I&apos;d have had her flayed alive with a salted bull-whip.
Saheila pushed Sebille to claim Divinity for the sake of all elvendom.
...and thus I brought Moriendor to his knees! And that was all before noontime.

*Say that he&apos;s correct.*
*Tell them they should be more careful. Bombs won&apos;t be enough if the Voidwoken get stronger.*
&lt;i&gt;You.&lt;/i&gt;
This unusually strong mushroom has an unusually strong taste to match.
Yes, thank you for coming. Indeed it would have been a beautiful ceremony, if only...
*Say you&apos;d like to see what she has for sale.*
Will...
You... you are not he: the Red Prince, the Spouse of the Sun, &lt;i&gt;Anan Erchet&lt;/i&gt;. You should not be here.
Juggling Mace
Wherever you take her... I hope it&apos;s a better place than this. Thank you.
*Ask about this Wellspring your god mentioned.*

*Smile. The gods shall provide you with what you need, you say, if not what you want.*

Eternal Armour could be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; useful. Very useful indeed.
*You enter her heat: thrust upon thrust until she scalds and with a scream, her nails digging for blood, all becomes an echo of the primal soul - a burst of overwhelming white.*
I notice that I&apos;ve yet to receive your war owl.
The demon Krylr said that &apos;the God King&apos; would fulfill &apos;the Covenant&apos;. What did he mean?

Please, should you find more Voidwoken...

*Stand beside the elf and tell the thug to back off.*
Your poor social life means nothing to me. We are on the path to Divinity - nothing can be allowed to drive us from it.
*His hand moves from his shovel to his sword. He wipes his forefinger along the blade, opening a bloody gash. He stares at the wound, then wipes the blood across his glistening forehead.*
