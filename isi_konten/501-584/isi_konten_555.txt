*You feel a connection pulsing from the stone. A tether stretching back millennia. You hear nothing, but you can &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;the screams.*
Beast has entrusted Divinity to me.
*She drums her fingers testily on her crossed arms.*
The souls of the cold-hearted lie ever frozen in ice, alive but not alive, in death as in life. You know yourself well, &lt;i&gt;Sebille Kaleran.&lt;/i&gt;
*Say &apos;The House of Dreams&apos;.*
*Say you&apos;d prefer not to discuss it.*
Oil barrels? Not a careful excavation it seems...
*Tell him if there&apos;s anything living that cannot be killed, you&apos;ve yet to meet it.*
Oh! Bless you, good lady. Bless you!
And you&apos;re just a tail-less mongrel who couldn&apos;t tell a truffle from a toenail. Now leave my sight, lest I make an unseemly squeal.
*Something within the ship snaps; the floorboards shudder.*
Doesn&apos;t take too kindly to elves. Can&apos;t blame him. Make yourself useful to him, and he may change his tune.
Gameplay
*Turn away and leave.*
Finally! Let&apos;s get out of here.
What am I, a town guard? I&apos;ve had enough shite, today, I&apos;m not taking any more prisoners. You&apos;ll die for your betrayal, and you&apos;ll die now!
You don&apos;t have any GM campaign active
[BEAST] *Tell him you&apos;ve done as he asks. It&apos;s time he spills what he knows about Operation Downfall.*
I&apos;m still trying to figure that out. She seems afflicted with... some sort of rabidness. It makes her difficult to approach, and nigh on impossible to treat.
*Tell the child you know Lohse personally. She&apos;s very nice.*
Magicockerel
Gratiana&apos;s life was selfish and hedonistic. No mercy.
*You&apos;re burning with curiosity. What destiny?*
*She grins devilishly and pulls you close.*
Show Party
Saheila shared elven knowledge of the Source with the world.
THEN THE CONTRACT IS SEALED!
This meticulously cared-for notebook is filled with line after line of small, neat handwriting. One page is marked with a lock of raven hair, bound by a blue ribbon.
Having the time of my life, truly.
What&apos;s that, Quercus? Do you have something?
*Laugh nervously and say that trauma affects us all in different ways.*
&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;left me to die. The God King offered me a new life. Quite an easy choice of allegiances, isn&apos;t it?
Yeah? Well I&apos;ll be. I&apos;ve been sittin&apos; here for nothin&apos;? Huh, ain&apos;t that a bit o&apos; shite? Time to stretch these legs, then! Maybe give Lohar a piece of my mind while I&apos;m at it.
Arming Cap
I&apos;ve... I&apos;ve never seen anything like it. I... I&apos;m sorry, I just &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t &lt;/i&gt;talk about it.
I just hope that we haven&apos;t left it too late to come to our senses... with luck, the others escaped these Black Ring wretches.
This excruciating existence between life and death is proof enough of that. I have begged for absolution! None c-comes.
You could forgive Alexandar when I could not, Godwoken. I hope you show me the same kindness. I will meet you aboard the Lady Vengeance... when you are ready.
I mean, &lt;i&gt;divinity!&lt;/i&gt; Will it be a blessing, or a burden? Would we be truly omnipotent, or merely the servants of an unruly universe, as desperate for control as we are now?
Lohar didn&apos;t tell me to let any nameless kin in. So why should I?
Slay Ryker.
*The dwarf brushes your hand off and shuffles back a step or two.*
We helped each other, that&apos;s what Sourcerers need to do nowadays.
Female Human Skeleton
Yes - it is as I said. &lt;i&gt;I am death.&lt;/i&gt; Flesh decays, but bones... bones &lt;i&gt;dance&lt;/i&gt; for me.
Canvas Pants
You. Are. Not. &lt;i&gt;Welcome.&lt;/i&gt;
*Groan* Out my... out my face... or I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll punch yer lights out... pint-sized prat...
I must hear the voice of my finest creation again. I polished every piece with care for the Empress.
That&apos;s right! RAWKAW! Doubt will serve you ill before the magicockerel!
You&apos;ve the privilege of having me as a travelling companion, but be well aware this is a privilege I can easily revoke!
Here, we stand less chance of catching Dallis&apos; eye. These horrors she commands. Shriekers, she calls them. They still protect the harbour, firing pure death at anything that moves near.
Shelves
I never said this was going to be easy, Lohse. I never said it wouldn&apos;t require sacrifice. You must do the right thing, now. For yourself and for all the realm.
I will &lt;i&gt;answer.&lt;/i&gt;
*Shrug. This is for them to work out, not you.*
*Your mouth opens wide and you scream in horror... but no sound comes. The blackened bones that once were Syrus Oates opens its mouth and starts to laugh... then he releases your hand...*
Then again, you are no average Rivellonian. Not after this.
Life Essence
*She throws you a haughty glance. In the sharp lines of her face, you see steely determination overtaking the spirit&apos;s distracted manner.*
*Hand over some gold and ask him to recite a poem in your race&apos;s honour.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
It&apos;s a good thing my injuries have healed... I wouldn&apos;t want to miss my chance to avenge our fallen.
I don&apos;t hear them complaining.
*Realising in a moment that life - and death - has brought them to the edge of oblivion, the reach for each other - *
Do what you do, ben-Mezd. I have seen it. My peace lies beyond.
Grrrrrowwwwwwwr!
Exotic Scimitar
*Your god whispers to teach her a lesson - to consume her Source. Obey your god.*
We found a strange mirror hidden in Kemm&apos;s attic. When we gazed into it, we saw the final moments of a hideous being, trapped in a cave of fire and molten rock. Who was that, and why does Kemm have such a device...?
Erma. She&apos;s called Erma. I haven&apos;t seen her in days!
*As your prayer drifts away on the breeze, you feel the world around you shift. You open your eyes to a courtyard with wooden targets and practice posts scattered about.*
*The pilgrim shakes her head sadly before turning away and returning to her solitary prayers.*
We escorted Delorus to his comrades at the Elf Temple.
You are... &lt;i&gt;defaulting?&lt;/i&gt; You disappoint me. You disappoint me very much.
It was all so very elegant.
...they hunt and wander, seeking rotting flesh.
*Ask if the bodies you saw belonged to her companions.*
*Scowl at the viscous, flaming monstrosity and prepare to do battle...*
My problem? My problem is that I experienced what you call an &apos;intimate moment&apos; and felt not a damn thing!
*Geomancy.*
Right
Then let us begin.
We found a particularly disturbing ingredient for the witch&apos;s brew - her own eyeball.
Ya almost had me there, lass. Hehe.
Change Option
Heh, heh, heh! It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;stabbin&apos;&lt;/i&gt; time!
[1] immediately gives you [2] extra Combat ability point(s) and [3] extra Civil ability point(s).
Don&apos;t be castin&apos; yer long shadow around here, mister. This here land&apos;s not fer your kind.
He loves me!
Sapphire Ring
*I told him this was now a prison island for Sourcerers, run by the Divine Order.*
If you ask me, he&apos;s a venomous cobra. The other Reds are taken in by his eloquence, but all I hear are silver-plated lies.
*Snap that you&apos;ve done nothing but spend centuries suffering in a cell.*
Not trained yet&lt;br&gt;
Numpad 5
Your belly is as yellow as his, is it? Then you shall both bleed, with Lucian&apos;s blessing!
I should keep my voice low. No need to wake the dead.
You! What do you do!?&lt;br&gt;
*Ask what happens to the animals.*
&apos;...zero.&apos;
*Say that you can&apos;t turn a blind eye to this...*
The war of the races approaches. The elves shall stand. You shall not see the end of us.
He has told me his plan, lizard. Lucian will not wash our sins away with water or fire, but with Deathfog. The true faithful will bathe in the fog of their own accord, and he will reward them with eternal bliss.
*Claim to be a new arrival to these shores, and ask if they can tell you anything about the area.*
Well, at the risk of saying something I shouldn&apos;t... that whole mansion is weird. She sits in that drawing room serving tea all day. As for him, well... he doesn&apos;t even sleep in the same room as his wife.
[SOLDIER] *Stiffen your back. The Paladin leader has given you specific instructions on the needed repairs. They must stand aside.*
Oh, but yours is not a &lt;i&gt;stink&lt;/i&gt; like the one that surrounds us, spat from a dying sea. Yours is a scent that invites a question:
*He sings. The scar song swells: a thousand tiny needles in your soul, chipping away at your will.*
Liberated my home town from the Black Ring, he did. We never had such peace as we did with his battalion protectin&apos; us.
We reported the cook&apos;s death to Magister Carver.
Let&apos;s see how fast these fingers can fly!
This sturdy staff thrums with energy, waiting to serve your purpose.
*Sniff.* I hate this game.
*Remain where you are.*
Titanic Ring
*Tell him that he&apos;s wasting a perfectly good book.*
I don&apos;t owe you squat. But if you&apos;ve got enough heart, I&apos;ll bite.
*Swallow your pride and ask him why it&apos;s so bad round here.*
I gave you fair warning. There will be no forgiveness.
Moving to involuntary death assistant!
*Tell the spirit about the list of Sourcerers you found in the Magisters&apos; Barracks. Is that any help?*
*The spirit gasps and tries to take shelter behind his own cadaver, but it&apos;s too late.*
Boar
I haven&apos;t seen the likes of her the whole time I&apos;ve been stationed here - and I think it&apos;s fair to say I&apos;d remember if I did!
Mysterious Tech
Brahmos
*Say that you thought he&apos;d be happy.*
Hush! And move.
I&apos;ve got a few good prospects for you in that case; tell me some more about what you&apos;re after, and I&apos;ll see that you have just the right type at your side.
Let&apos;s hope Jahan can help.
&lt;i&gt;That &lt;/i&gt;is the fate of the world under the God King. We cannot allow it.
*Say you saw the way he looked at her. You wish he&apos;d look like that at you.*
Our guest stirs! Welcome, Godwoken. Glad to see you safely aboard.
Nothing in this land can counter the Shriekers&apos; power like those weapons. Without them, the Seekers are truly hopeless.
*Ask why he&apos;s showing you a figment of your imagination.*
For reasons I&apos;ll not disclose right now, it is imperative that I should meet with Bahara: one of our kind&apos;s revered mystics. Promise me we&apos;ll look for her, and I&apos;ll extend you the blessing of my company.
*Recall his kisses and his touch. Ask if you can join him for what comes next.*
Come on out, darling! Lover boy here has no idea what&apos;s going on.
Saheila shared elven knowledge of Source with the world.
*Nod. You are Zorl-Stissa&apos;s chosen.*
*Listen to her song some more.*
*The man remains gripped by intense pain. He doesn&apos;t meet your eye.*
By all means.
*Tell him to be quiet, and slap him for good measure.*
What is this contraption?
But he was never truly defeated.
&lt;i&gt;...aaaand&lt;/i&gt; you.
Think you&apos;re cute, do ye handsome? Business is business; even the Magisters know that. Get shoppin&apos; or leave me be.
*You feel Justinia&apos;s smile warming your back.*
You said it, Hilga. You&apos;re a true patriot.
We convinced the Magisters to let us intervene.
Human graves. Let&apos;s hope none are earmarked for me.
Surfaces
*On the page in thick black letters is written: &lt;b&gt;SILVER CLAW&lt;/b&gt;.*
Griff&apos;s Drudanae
That seems unrealistic, but let&apos;s say it happened. The dog sits down, presumably?
*Examine the belt.*
We&apos;ve had bad times.
There was a... a fight. Some dwarves attacked some Magisters, and there were Sourcerers, too. And then the bugs came. Those &lt;i&gt;Void &lt;/i&gt;things.
Nothing will stop me, understand? &lt;i&gt;Nothing&lt;/i&gt;.
[BEAST] *Tell Han you have something important to do off the island. You intend to get out of here.*
*Say that you met Wainslow, but he&apos;s dead as well.*
