The Black Ring... they want answers from me, but if they find you here, they&apos;ll kill you. Get out of here, &lt;i&gt;now.&lt;/i&gt;
*Demand a reward.*
...dead...
*Tell her not to remember his actions, only his call to action. He wants her to be the next Divine.*
Hmm... I suppose the small folk of Rivellon ought to know my tale... all was well after my engagement to Braccus for a time. But then - &lt;i&gt;then - &lt;/i&gt;he started to pay less attention to me...
*The blazing brightness dies down. Squinting, you now see no dragon before you - but the figure of a handsome lizard, a handsome lizard with the same eyes as Slane.*
It is no-one&apos;s fault but yours! Your King told you not to seek forbidden knowledge, and yet you persisted.
Keep out of this, unless you want the same!
*The pain intensifies - it&apos;s spreading past your arm, across your chest... your lungs feel like they&apos;re &lt;i&gt;on fire.*&lt;/i&gt;
*He jerks his head to look at you, but says nothing. Then he opens his mouth... and you can clearly see the tip of a crossbow bolt, protruding from the back of his throat.*
*She dives forward, hands outstretched, but the urn slips through her fingers. As it strikes the ground, the jar shatters like glass.*
All in the Family
*The humming grows louder and louder, until - *
A moment&apos;s pause? I had thought us too wicked for rest.
*Helpers? Tell her you know of the Thieves&apos; Guild. Is that who she means?*
Godwoken...
I hate to say it, but I&apos;d rather be in my place than theirs.
We met an Elven Scion holding a Magister captive.
*Say you met with her, even lay with her, but she didn&apos;t actually mention dragons...*
Ruby
Search the Ancient Empire consulate.
*You feel newfound powers of the Source course wildly through your body. Deep inside your soul, your god calls for you.*
Stay alert. We must remain on our guard here...
*Her mouth sets in a grim line, and dark memories flicker unbidden across her eyes.*
*Her face resembles crumpled parchment as she squints at you.*
Have it your way.
Own way? Torture? &lt;i&gt;Dismemberment?&lt;/i&gt; No matter - Vrogir&apos;s temple is restored. Those heretics cannot dull his might.
*You feel him in your head, scrabbling for purchase amongst your thoughts, looking for a way in, his madness and his anger and his hate banging on the door of your mind... looking for the severed head of Alexandar.*
*Choose to fight.*
*A hot dagger of pain suddenly shoots through your head, nearly causing you to drop to your knees.*
Ah git, will ya?
*Report that the tinkerer is dead*
A word of warning to you, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
...I am at the ready.
Chokers. They strangle us. Steal our voices.
It&apos;s true what the ol&apos; miss told me. &apos;Victor,&apos; she said, &apos;you can&apos;t gamble forever. It&apos;s only a matter of time before your luck runs out.&apos; Bless her heart.
Then you prove yourself ignorant, miss. The Voidwoken are drawn to Source. With these collars on, no Source can flow from us. We are safer here than anywhere in Rivellon. You can thank the Divine Order for that.
To weaken Adramahlihk, Malady recommends a guided trip to his home plane.
She&apos;s fighting a battle for her life, for her very self. It&apos;s a battle she may yet win, even if only temporarily. But she&apos;ll need &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; help!
At last! I&apos;ll have his head!
*Rest your hand on her shoulder. You won&apos;t let her or her people come to harm.*
Placing the eyeball gem in the ornate skull revealed a secret passage.
You&apos;re a real hero in my book, you know that? Sticking it to the Reds? Hero!
Desperate how?
*Capsized? So he was building a vessel, was he?*
A timberman&apos;s faithful friend, this wood axe will chop whatever needs chopping in your neck of the woods.
Falchion
Minor Wits Potion
*Dying? Ask what&apos;s happened to him.*
Undead Medat
*Breathless, the Magister fishes out a canteen of water. She gulps half of it down, then splashes blood and grime from her face with the rest. She nods at you, a touch wary.*
Huh. Charming. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;don&apos;t care, I see that!
Use to enhance jewellery. Distributed exclusively by the Four Sisters&apos; Trading Company.
Stitched with sinew and padded with human hair, on the hands of Braccus Rex himself these gloves throttled the necks of uncountable prisoners in the Fort Joy of old.
Blessed fortune that I am here to protect you, to guide you. You and I are the last Eternals Fane. That is why it will be us. That is why it &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;be us.
*Sebille addresses a solitary figure: Zaleskar! They whisper and hiss, threaten one another with gruesome violence, but just when a fight is about the break out, Sebille&apos;s words seem to sway him into submission.*
Were they talking to that Voidwoken?
Axe Kit Part I: Shaft

The Silver Claw&apos;s blade has clearly dulled. But you - you look like a man of action. A doer of deeds. And I have a matter of some urgency I&apos;d ask you to... attend to.
I should have expected such boorishness from you, Marcus. You&apos;ve always had a monster lurking in you, after all.
Good. Make yourself comfortable. The harder you fight, the harder the experiment will be on you.
Cursor
*His voice drops to an excited whisper.*
Now get your smelly self away from me.
Goodness. Why must the elven mind be so &lt;i&gt;feeble?&lt;/i&gt; To think, a simpleton touched with Divinity. The Gods really &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;cruel.
Eye
Ah, it was a jest! Of course it was. You would never...I pray you would never...
Magister Reimond may not be with us in person, but his orders were clear - and we obeyed to the letter.
*She tosses her pack to you and strides away.*
*The sky burns red, and ash falls at your feet. Ruin calls to ruin.*
I was dressed somewhat differently. Travelling incognito, if you would. I believe I was wearing the face of an elf at the time.
Nice haircut, smiley.
A megalomaniac bit of shrubbery. And you&apos;ll need this to kill it:
[LOHSE] *Scoff. Tell him hide and seek is boring.*
Thunder &amp; Rain Indoors 01
Bellwether! Get over to the Black Bull tavern and question their cook - see if there&apos;s any truth to this!
That should help. Now, run along with your new toys. I&apos;ve my own &lt;i&gt;errands&lt;/i&gt; to run, you know.
*Declare that you can sense he has secrets. That makes him dangerous in your eyes.*
*You can. You can see nothing else. Your eyes start to burn as the brightness fills your head with fire, and you can feel your sight fading.*
Ah, yes! Of course, of course, but... this mightn&apos;t be quite what you were expecting, but, well...
*Remark that by its bloodstained teeth, in the sea it should have little to fear.*
This is a mistake, Lohse. You must make the sacrifice, you must destroy the demon, or he&apos;ll never stop.
*Ask her to define &apos;interesting&apos;.*
Leggings
In short: travel west in search of a dwarven base of operations in the treacherous Reaper&apos;s Bluffs.
And what kind of Divine was the Red Prince, as the world battled the demons?
*He laughs; the sound of a hiccupping demon choking on raw offal.*
Her...
Mysterious.
Some among the dwarven pilgrims in Arx may be close to the Queen. They may know of her plans.
Yes, yes, that is Peeper - yes! Marge&apos;s egg.
*Say that if you&apos;re to prove these accusations, you have to know where to start looking.*
You&apos;ll recognise your ears when I cut them off.
There are only whispers of a vault, and quieter whispers still of what it may contain. But at least you know now that it&apos;s there.
*Ask about the other options.*
*Ask Zaleskar who he is and why he&apos;s helping you.*
Shadow Mystic
*Tell her you&apos;d very much like to know the secret of the Black Widowmaker&apos;s false elixir.*
And take this key. You&apos;ll know where to use it when the time comes.
Look around you. Your &apos;stable population&apos; at its finest.
Circle
Whatever, mum.
What am I, a dog doctor? Dog&apos;s dead. Go on, gis&apos; a penny for a dead dog.
[SEBILLE] *Assure her lizards spell trouble. Always.*
Yes... yes I know. There have been other... developments since then. I read his papers... I can hardly...
Don&apos;t hurt me... don&apos;t hurt me... don&apos;t hurt me...
Scaredy cat.
Persuasion
*You awake to the flicker of torchlight and the sound of voices. &apos;Here, crack this&apos;un open. With locks like these, there&apos;ll be something good inside.&apos;*
Well this will certainly make murders easier to solve.
*Ask if it &lt;i&gt;has &lt;/i&gt;to be over. She knows how you feel about her...*
You&apos;re asking for it now, killer!
*Note his desperate condition, and offer to help him.*
It isn&apos;t that I&apos;m naive. It&apos;s just... I thought...
Some say you grew in the womb of a devil. Some say you are a volcano&apos;s tears sprung to life.
You know as I do that this world is better off without Alexandar. Power truly corrupted him, just as it did Lucian...
How dare you stand in our way?
*The priest&apos;s jaws might be sewn shut with fishing wire, so harshly do they clench at the sight of Beast. He speaks one clipped, precise syllable.*
*The bizarre creature utters a series of gurgles. It seems to be gesturing towards deeper in the cavern.*
*Shrug. Your purchases are none of her beeswax.*
We really gave those Black Ring what-for, eh? Wiped &apos;em all out in the blink of an eye. Damned proud to have served with you, ben-Mezd. &lt;i&gt;Damned &lt;/i&gt;proud.
Lady Barkington of the White Paw
*Ask for a Fighter who dishes out the damage, but knows how to defend themselves.* ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54] gold)
Dead Dwarf Civilian
Dallis&apos; Assistant
Do you see now?! Your foul Sourcerery will be the death of us all!
You know... I reckon I&apos;d hoped to go out in my sleep, nice and easy. The battlefield&apos;s for killin&apos;, not for dyin&apos;.
Ingredients: Arrows
Introduction to Trade
[IFAN] *Your hunter&apos;s eye notices all the barrels he&apos;s tending to share a mark. Kneel, pretending to adjust your boot, so you have a closer look.*
Magisters are a blight - they deserve worse than the death I gave them. I wouldn&apos;t taint the earth with their carcasses. Better that they vanish into unsuspecting stomachs.
She knows the House of Dreams is the ally of dragons. She&apos;s aware we&apos;ve been trying to unite you against all the odds. So go to her, for she awaits you with ravenous patience.
*Pull a flask of liquor from a well-hidden pocket and offer it to her. Warms the heart.*
Penny for a dead dog?
You have plenty of chances. None remain!
*Pet the warg.*
...unless it&apos;s to kill the emissary of the Void that the God King never steals ultimate power. So thank you. Now I get to be ruthless. Now I get to &lt;i&gt;matter.&lt;/i&gt;
Tremor
Kick player
&lt;i&gt;Rav Mudom. Charol evdekeis racht.&lt;/i&gt; You have come.
*A claw returns: five unseen talons splayed over the crown of your head. As it slowly starts to push you down, you know you cannot resist.*
Precisely.
Withermoore&apos;s Soul Jar
The souls of the cold-hearted lie ever frozen in ice, alive but not alive, in death as in life. You know yourself well.
Scarlet Necklace
*Ask who you&apos;re speaking to.*
How dare you classify this slop as food? I&apos;ve seen more appetising things coming out of plague-stricken pigs!
The masked priestess, Gratiana, told Sir Gareth of them after she granted us shelter here. She was reluctant at first, but, well... Sir Gareth can be very insistent...
