This heartens me. I&apos;m glad to know we&apos;ve not sacrificed in vain. I&apos;m sad to know we couldn&apos;t do more.
S&apos;in her lips. S&apos;in the magic.
Come on, man. Be reasonable.
The heavy, gold-plated ring is stamped with the shape of a dragon. Its thinning band suggests it was worn frequently by its owner.
Hmmm, I suppose that&apos;s true. I suppose I shouldn&apos;t risk a more... permanent death if you&apos;re bound to find out sooner or later. Fine: I will speak.
*Remark that your shipmates are as chatty as gulls. You can barely hear over the din.*
*Say that you&apos;re still not clear what exactly a Seeker is...*
&lt;i&gt;Another sacrifice I was forced to make. Those beautiful people. I was as kind as I could be, I promise you that.&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, dear. That is quite im*snort*possible. The estate is already mine. I simply allow him to reside here in exchange for the most &lt;i&gt;delightful&lt;/i&gt; foodstuffs.
Be quick, mind. He&apos;s set to sail any moment.
I... I...
*Say you&apos;ll keep an eye out.*
...and dares to wave her tattered, tarnished banner!
I&apos;m a confident man, my friend - but I have my limits. Until you&apos;ve purged the Shriekers, we will remain here.
Isbeil? Damn her to Nemesis if her duties go unfulfilled. Weak, even in undeath, consumed by petty jealousy of the God King&apos;s star pupils. Yet our master&apos;s might is &lt;i&gt;legendary.&lt;/i&gt;
Level Up
The exit seems to be blocked from the other side...
Eternal Protector
[JESTER] *Tell him his show lacked structure and the dialogue was awful. But the theme was clear.*
Some truths have lain in the grave too long. There let them rest. Question me no further, for I have no answers to give.
Hell if I know. Don&apos;t rightly know if it can be done. If they take the Source out of ya, what are ya?
*Walk over and run your hand along your desk. You haven&apos;t seen it in centuries...*
Lohar,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isbeil&apos;s agents inform her that the Deathfog is in your possession. It must be delivered to Arx with all possible speed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not know what is causing this delay, but I do know you will rectify this unfortunate error. I&apos;m sure you know the penalty for disobedience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not disappoint me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Your Queen
*Change your mind, and change the subject.*
[VILLAIN] *Grin and say that you detect a scheme beneath his callousness - he&apos;s up to something, isn&apos;t he?*
Ranged
[RED PRINCE] *Shout that you&apos;re a full three fingers taller than him - the same height you were when you ruled the House of War!*
*Reveal that you yourself are a Sourcerer, same as his Septa.*
Use
You take me for a fool. Pay for your insolence!
Sir?
You saw this with your own eyes...? I see it in you. You did. I... I... this is abhorrent. Outrageous. &lt;i&gt;Evil.&lt;/i&gt;
Horse Wagon
I&apos;m a bit out of practice. Let&apos;s assume the worst and hope for the best!
I know a liar when I see one. Prove to me your innocence!
Performance
Red, you&apos;re a credit to your kin. Malady&apos;s raring to go, and I can&apos;t say I&apos;m keen to keep floating to nowhere. Let&apos;s move!
GM Campaign
Smell good. Smell good! Like forest and earth and &lt;i&gt;blood&lt;/i&gt;.
This corpse is wearing Black Ring garb. How strange.
*Tell him his devotion to her is impressive.*
*Look around the ramshackle town and muse that the dwarf is lucky to have a job.*
Bound Tome
So much for a peaceful stroll.
I&apos;d keep a wary eye, mind. I saw one of &apos;em draggin&apos; a Voidwoken in there once. There&apos;s freaks and then there&apos;s lunatics...
*Lay a hand to your weapon. Tell him you&apos;re feeling disturbed, too.*
And there ya have it. I gave you every chance to show me who you were. So ya did.
Look, my brother in beardness. I can&apos;t say why. But if you know what&apos;s good for you, you&apos;ll get out of Arx. Leave it far behind and never look back.
*Turn away from the raving spirit.*
Shiny and bright, this whistle given to you by Paladin Hardwin can be used to whistle up a war-owl.
He seems dangerous. Let&apos;s slit his throat.
There you are! Not too tight, I hope? The collar I mean. Oh, not to worry: every dog has to get used to its leash.
&lt;i&gt;tell me who you are or I will kill you and do not doubt me for I tell the truth&lt;/i&gt;
[SCHOLAR] *Ignore the beast&apos;s pleas and move closer. The ancient texts tell of such undead...*
You can still prove yourself, Ifan. You can still play a role for the new Divine: &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.
What... what&apos;s going on? Is that creature... eating a corpse?
*Samadel nods at you wearily and turns to walk away with Han.*
I heard that the Paladins killed unharmed Magisters. Didn&apos;t even let &apos;em surrender.
Audrey! If you can hear me, say something - &lt;i&gt;please!&lt;/i&gt;
Gore Tiger
&lt;br&gt;The number of Action Points you can have in total. You save up unused Action Points from previous turns, but never more than this.
*The White Magister yanks his head towards the hanging man and scowls.*
Persuade Brother Morgan to admit you to the vault.
Queen Justinia will use Deathfog as a weapon of war. We must stop her.
Ain&apos;t fit for beasts...
*Ifan laughs, low and guttural. His fingers release your shoulders and you no longer feel his presence behind you. Turning, you see him stride off without even a backward glance.*
*Reaper&apos;s Coast? Ask why he&apos;s heading there - you thought he&apos;d want somewhere more isolated.*
You will not take me again, Dallis!
*Appeal to her desire for vengeance. Tell her you have satisfied it.*
*Keep still and hide the fact that you think Tovah let her comrade die.*
One more step and you&apos;ll feel the Source!
[SEBILLE] *Say that such an ambitious type might want someone to vanish permanently, in order to strengthen their own position.*
[Translate81_a128993a-c118-491f-8426-db79dfd87dd2]
[1] [2] [3], for [4]
And who might you be? Another adventuring type?
I know the rules of war are little more than guidelines, but I can&apos;t imagine anyone would consider this fair play.
Murderer... Thief... Impostor... &lt;i&gt;I am Baran Levere!&lt;/i&gt;
The gargoyle on the Necromancer Tower told us that we entered his maze incorrectly. If we want any aid in making it through, we must seek the correct entrance.
Ehhh. I don&apos;t want to brag, but it happens now and then. It&apos;s amazing when someone connects to the music. But... I&apos;ve been thinking.
*Say it&apos;s even better than fiction: It really happened.*
A million candles. A million all around, and they&apos;re just like me... they&apos;re just like me...
There you touch upon the very heart of the matter.
You intrude on our rest? You&apos;re as stupid as a flesh-wearer, I dare say.
Speak with Slane the Winter Dragon.
I was hungry and thirsty for days, then I rested. When I woke up next to my corpse, I thought I was delirious.
Why would you heal me just to kill me?! Bloody sadist! I won&apos;t go lightly...
*The dog wags its tail at the sight of you and licks your hand affectionately.*
Then the &lt;i&gt;ripping &lt;/i&gt;starts. Your dreams ripped away. Your thoughts. Your &lt;i&gt;self. &lt;/i&gt;Is it &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; you, and it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;you. Your body is meat, perfectly preserved. The mist keeps it safe. It&apos;s your soul that&apos;s boiled.
*Say it seems strange to you: why one? Why not seven, just like there were?*
An elf like you. An innocent.
*Ask where she&apos;s off to.*
Yes. Yes. Yet... one more corpse is just one more corpse, isn&apos;t it? All the others... they still dissolve to bone. None that I lost can ever return to me. Perhaps we may at least be reunited in the Hall.
*Ask him about the war he mentioned.*
*Say that you will return once you are sure the path is clear.*
Magical Elven Longbow
I owe my life to the holy pilgrim! May he cure the land of Source like he cured my body of illness!
Lost your collar, Sourcerer? How&apos;s this - once I&apos;ve killed the witch, you can have hers instead.
*Wish her all the best and take your leave.*
You&apos;d think, right? But no. This is your moment.
*You are Lennard Rawl and your belly churns with horror. You were lurking here when you were overtaken with a sense of love. You felt at peace. You felt Lucian&apos;s hand on your shoulder.*
Out of the fryin&apos; pan, and into... Hey. You know what? You&apos;ve heard that one before. Let&apos;s try a new one: shite&apos;s all mucked up. Seems more to the point, doesn&apos;t it?
Find out what&apos;s locking the lever.
I don&apos;t feel fear. I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;feel anger, so try not to vex me. What do you want?
Goblin Chief
*Say you aren&apos;t sure...*
Broad Skull
*Kill him.*
Oh my, yes... and please, let&apos;s not be so formal. Down here, call me... Jiji.
Her hooves: so cloven, trimmed, and neat.&lt;br&gt;Her nose: quite fussy, seeking treats.&lt;br&gt;Her tail: a whimsy curlycue!&lt;br&gt;Her call: a lilting interlude!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mere words cannot describe the zeal&lt;br&gt;I sense with each melodic squeal.&lt;br&gt;And thus I dub my damoiselle:&lt;br&gt;Her Royal Highness Lulabelle!&lt;br&gt;
*She lapses into an overwhelmed, glazed-eyed silence for a moment, before gathering herself.*
Once you&apos;ve caught your breath, I actually have another little request for you...
Back, Sourcerer! Back!
*Hesitate. Mention you&apos;re not so sure about a travel companion with an otherworldly spirit inside her.*
*As your fingertips brush the surface, the whispers turn to screams.*
Enough to keep us in drink. That&apos;s all I need to know.
[LOHSE] *Quip that you&apos;d stick around, but she seems like a real boar.*
...sincere apologies. I must return to my work now.
Captain&apos;s Hideaway
Please do not betray my trust in you. Lord Arhu will be most upset if his privacy is disturbed.
Move along, adventurer, we don&apos;t need you here.
*Ask her what&apos;s on her mind.*
*State that you are a private investigator working to lure out a thief.*
I should be the one rotting back there, not Leya. Not that innocent wee pup...
*Scrolls filled with rambling minutia and inconsequential observations. Even the parchment itself is unexceptional; worn, ripped, and boasting what might be a wine stain in its lower corner.*
Black Mirror
*Ask what he means. So close to what?*
Rename Folder
Magical Combat Dagger
Beehive
I&apos;m glad to see you&apos;re quite ready to travel on, but I can&apos;t help but notice something&apos;s... missing.
*In the near distance you see a man, though shadows obscure his features. A faint, gutteral chittering emanates from a cage before him.*
[1] was invulnerable to damage from a surface.
Ah yes - Justinia&apos;s impossibly persuasive advisor. Marvelous woman, fully devoted to the God King. You may have defeated me, but &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; will devour you whole and roar her victory to our eternal master.
Hadn&apos;t heard from &apos;em in a couple days now. I thought maybe we&apos;d lost the messengers to Voidwoken in the hills, but now... I think it&apos;s worse than I thought.
*Hold the gem you took from Alexandar out towards the door.*
With soles of steel and ivory ornaments, these boots exude violent superiority.
*He swaggers right up to you until you&apos;re standing nose to nose, and looks down at you, a playful twinkle in his eyes.*
Poor lad. No-one deserves to lose it all in this forgotten place.
*You didn&apos;t ask for this. Invoke the ancient proverb of Korlan-sei the Great: &apos;Fat chance, baby.&apos;*
She got eated by a Voidwoken.
We&apos;ll find out who did it. One way or another.
Armour-Piercing Grenade
*Sounds like solid money. Ask why he quit.*
*The trader sways in time to the bard&apos;s tune, but stops as you approach. She looks at the mansion nervously, then back to you.*
*The spirit of a dwarf gives you an incongruously cheery smile, given his circumstances.*
*Try to convince the spirit to stay where it is and hope someone finds you.*
