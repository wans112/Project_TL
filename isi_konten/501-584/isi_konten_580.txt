&lt;i&gt;Five &lt;/i&gt;Voidwoken!
*You&apos;ve pushed him to the edge? Tell him he&apos;s been sucking the joy from your life for what feels like an eternity now.*
*Hedge your bets. Tell Isbeil you aided the Sallow Man. You know she is Black Ring; you are her &lt;i&gt;ally.*&lt;/i&gt;
Indeed, but we&apos;ll soon put an end to that. And then - &lt;i&gt;freedom.&lt;/i&gt;
*Fearless, she steps closer to you with a nightmarish creaking of bones. Threat is more than apparent in her manner.*
Source of all, eh? A bold move, I&apos;ll grant you that - I didn&apos;t think anyone considered the little people any more...
*Hold up your hands and back away.*
You choose this. Not me.
A little too magisterial for my liking.
[IFAN] *Say that you want no relationship at all with him, dull or otherwise.*
Spirit of a Murdered Godwoken
Extraordinary, son, just extraordinary. The spirit of the One has yet to settle, but it hovers near. It knows yer great feat. I feel the glow.
*A crooked sneer surfaces from the spirit&apos;s deep pit of contempt.*
And an honour it will be, Your Highness!
*You are, but admit that you&apos;re growing tired of them.*
YEEOowh...! T-thank you, mistress. Pass freely.
*Bid him continue.*
Loved ones returned to you...
The Mother Tree has many elves under her control, bound to do her bidding.
I talked to the Scion of the Mother Tree. She asked me to kill the Shadow Prince.
Another skull crumbled to bits...
Stop the flooding.
Marge&apos;s egg! Margey! EGGY! EGGY BABY, MARGEY MARGE!
Wondor
*His mouth tightens into a joyfully awkward smile.*
She&apos;s right. She stands with me, no matter what.
*Tell her you&apos;re uniquely interested in destroying Voidwoken. She doesn&apos;t owe you anything.*
With their queen dead and the Voidwoken gone, the dwarves held the greatest party in the history of Dwarfdom. A new king took the throne - the local brewer. Six days later he was stabbed to death with a mutton fork.
*Ask in what capacity they served the mad king.*
*Lohse&apos;s voice catches in her throat. The joy drains from her face; her eyes lose focus and her whole body goes rigid.*
You say that...
*Offer him the tainted stew. Tell him this batch is especially worthwhile.*
Only the well-lit path is devoid of peril.
*Tell him you don&apos;t have exceedingly high hopes.*
Yes, you do. Luckily for you, I&apos;m going to keep my eye on you. And luckily for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, you&apos;re rather easy to look at.
Disable this if you don&apos;t want the game to automatically create save games at predefined points in the game. This is not recommended.
TO CRAFT
I am one of the Divine Order. We are responsible for everyone. It&apos;s our job to keep you safe. By the authority of the Divine Order. I... I command you, ok?
Allow other players in your local network to find and join your game
*He gives you a cool look. Then a flirtatious smile.*
But who...
*Figure? Who does he mean?*
No.
The Mother gave you a gift through Saheila. She gave of her power. And now she is ailing. Now, you must come to her aid.
I&apos;m waiting...
Ain&apos;t no tellin&apos; where that priest went off to. Started actin&apos; all funny not so long ago, then flew the coop.
[UNDEAD] *Tell her she is a fool, for you do not have a heart.*
*Say that trying isn&apos;t enough.*
Something inside me says that&apos;s a very bad idea.
&apos;Here lies Withermoore the Supplicant&apos;
Cloud
*He lifts his right arm, showing a white bandage beneath his ribs. A wet, red spot shows through.*
Maybe... maybe you can cross the river then. Ma lifted the bridge, but there&apos;s got to be another way. Right?
Guardian Angel
Oh, but that won&apos;t do at all! You really shouldn&apos;t have threatened to harm one of my brothers in arms. I have no other option now: no option but to cut off your head. No doubt it&apos;s worth a fortune!
Hey, you! What are you up to? Let me see your belongings!
*Tip her a wink, then bid her goodbye.*
*Tell him a dog walks in and sits down at the next table.*
*Tell her you don&apos;t really care to make some tea.*
*Nod and tell her you&apos;ll stick around.*
*She scans you from head to toe, then rests her eyes on yours.*
Let&apos;s sail while the wind still favours us. After all this bathing in blood, I&apos;d like to bathe in the sun.
Glowing Door
*He leans closer as you move away, and lets slip a guttural whisper.*
See what I see. Feel what I feel.
[SOLDIER] *Tell the cub to lift up its head and stick out its chest. It&apos;s time to... bear up.*
True Brew: Amethyst Deceiver
Wood to wood. Birth to birth.
One of us ate Lohar&apos;s head.
Freezing Arrow
*A slow, pained grin spreads across the lizard&apos;s face. Her tongue flickers.*
Stubborn child... but you &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;obey... you must...
I thought so. I &lt;i&gt;see &lt;/i&gt;it on you, like an aura.
In the Hall of Echoes, my passenger was weakening against the Void. It gave me Source Vampirism that I may absorb the Source of the dead.
That question is unbefitting of a Godwoken.
Night Blue
Then my master will lead you to your true ascension, champion.
Has the Empire fallen so far? The old master would never have allowed such folly.
...No I am &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;going to share our magic with it! I don&apos;t care how much you like it, Quercus, I-
&lt;i&gt;Thank you&lt;/i&gt;. I have family outside. They wait for me.
[OUTLAW] *Tell him you could give him some tips on extorting money from other travellers instead; shakedowns are your specialty.*
*His face wrinkles, and he stares at you intently.*
Alexandar is dead and we have his head to prove it.
*About his garden...*
Wait! What are you... nnnnNNNNNNOO!
[UNDEAD] *Ask if she&apos;s ever been to the Hall of Echoes.*
Maybe. Maybe it starts with the sweet parts, first. Leaves the terribly bitter parts for last.
A higher power has temporarily granted you the ability to see &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;spirits&lt;/font&gt;. As you learn to channel more &lt;font color=&quot;008858&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/font&gt;, you may one day  be able to use this powerful ability at will within the mortal realm.
My my. What a specimen.
*Decline and take your leave.*
Don&apos;t hurt yourself, now. I know how &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; this must be for you...
*Click*
One minute I&apos;m on my way to Fort Joy, the next there&apos;re these &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;.
[NOBLE] *Outrageous! Unwelcome? Doesn&apos;t he know who you &lt;i&gt;are?*&lt;/i&gt;
A player has left the lobby
*Advise her to be smart. Hadn&apos;t enough Magisters died here?*
After suffering all the way here with you both, I&apos;ve nothing much to say to you &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; your leader.
The Deathfog bomb is in place. We should be elsewhere when it goes off.
*The spirit of a troll stands before you. He attempts to pick up a nearby rock, and frowns with confusion as his ghostly hand passes right through it.*
From Offhand Weapon: [1]-[2]
*Turn away.*
Listen up. The queen was a good woman once, and I&apos;m her bastard cousin, so I would know it. Come rainy days, we&apos;d sail paper boats and drop beetles on &apos;em for plank-walkin&apos;. She was never a beast - but her spirit roamed free.
Incinerated Magister
So it was you, was it? Prepare to die, thief!
Giant Flame Rune
Holy hellhounds! Those dogs sound out for blood.
*Say that you believe in the gods, even more now than before.*
*Add a herbmix into one of the slots.*
Cursed Firestorm Grenade
You... I try to give you a chance. More than your Divine Order give mine.
&lt;i&gt;*&apos;Attention, Reds!&apos;&lt;/i&gt; It&apos;s Alexandar&apos;s voice, and you stand at attention. The Bishop is to speak of the newly created Seeker division. Perhaps the two of you will be chosen, should Lucian will it!*
Hrrmph. You don&apos;t look all that complicated to me - fancy yourself as something special do you?
*Say that you met her on Bloodmoon Island. You could tell she&apos;s a survivor - she can beat this demon.*
Feh! Fend for yourself then. That pretty face won&apos;t protect you. I&apos;ll take what I want after the Reds get to you, anyway.
You left me no choice!
*Wrap her in a tight embrace. You&apos;ve been alone for so long...*
[SOLDIER] *Tell him you&apos;d be marching to war.*
This is ruined.
The Advocate seemed to know who&apos;s behind the Godwoken, but refused to give up a name.
But the Shriekers ground them into the mire once. Unless the Seekers hold the weapons held within Braccus&apos;s vault, they will do so again.
Cleaning Up Module
The flames have faded. There must be a trick to keeping them lit.
*Tell the child he should run along; it isn&apos;t safe out here.*
Hmm. Very well. But I have my eyes on you. If you get into trouble, trust me: I know.
Come now, let&apos;s begin immediately! I shall compile my notes afterwards.
Very well, I suppose I have to respect your privacy. But remember:
*Compliment him on his sonorous voice.*
Go, yes, to the island that harbours the Master. I&apos;m closer to my prey than I&apos;ve been in years. Might as well be a continent away.
*You feel your God straining within you - release her - she&apos;ll get the truth from the imp.*
Divine blessings upon you!
Blackpits - Mines
Ha! Go on - I&apos;d prefer it if you did. The Magisters here are like my children. Why, my boy Kniles is the house physician in Fort Joy itself.
Cursed Water
Desperate measures, made necessary by the &lt;i&gt;treacherous &lt;/i&gt;actions of our so-called allies. My encryption guards the most important secrets.
At last the world was at peace.
Mmm... excellent wine.
Oh, they&apos;re not so bad. At least, not when they&apos;re treating me, Madame... erm... Madame Josephine Gribble De Peeb, with due deference!
Speak to the spirit of the Dreamer. Force her to open the path to my realm. Your destiny awaits there.
Beach - Creek
Queen. Mistress. Mother. She blessed us all.
*Clear your throat and hum along with her.*
In the skeleton&apos;s battle of wits, we had the superior intellect.
I&apos;m already aware of that... establishment. We have an informal agreement - they show discretion, and don&apos;t infere with Magister duties, and in return, we leave them alone...
I am forbidden to leave my watch, and there is no need for formality. Gratiana will receive you as you are. You&apos;ll soon find her. She never strays far from the statue of our goddess.
While drowning, we heard a voice. We heard it again in the Hollow Marshes. It told us to seek it, wherever it may be.
Vengeance IV
*Explain that you&apos;re still a little confused. Where did this acorn come from?*
*Keep your hand where it is.*
Swat the bugs. Grind them into the dirt!
No. No I suppose they don&apos;t, which is why I&apos;ve no intention of carrying out the death sentence that I should, &lt;i&gt;despite&lt;/i&gt; your leaving me and all those others behind on a sinking ship!
Griff&apos;s Key
SOURCE POINT COST
*Reply that life&apos;s true purpose is to love others as passionately as you can.*
Armoury of Braccus Rex
Cave - Crystal Mine A
Ping
*Jonathan deserves no sympathy. You know what he is capable of. Greedily consume his Source.*
*The girl&apos;s hand goes completely limp in yours.*
I guess there&apos;s no hiding it now.
Total Value Of Stolen Items
Some of the others are below decks. Let&apos;s see how they&apos;re faring.
...lost in mem&apos;ry, present gone from sight.
&lt;i&gt;&apos;Swann and Rince; Crossley and Locke.&lt;br&gt;Quincy, Keller, Harkwood, Haran.&lt;br&gt;An essence yours no longer;&lt;br&gt;Souls and Source, come forth!&apos;&lt;/i&gt;
*His eyes go wide.*
Armour...? Such a limiting word, but yes, it serves that purpose, amongst others.
That&apos;s enough of that. &lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
Those Magisters are going to regret they didn&apos;t finish me off, I swear it!
Sorry, but I can&apos;t let ya enter. You ain&apos;t walkin&apos; closely with the One.
