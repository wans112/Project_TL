Dead Magister Researcher
[SOLDIER] *Salute and apologise that it took so long for you to get here: you&apos;re their relief for guard duty.*
[MYSTIC] *Say there&apos;s nothing divine about the Order anymore, but you do have faith in what is truly divine.*
*Say you&apos;ve heard he has a great interest in demons. You thought he might take an interest in yours.*
Ma is back! She&apos;s back! Thank you so, so, so, so much!
It&apos;s stuck fast; I&apos;ll need something to prise it open.
Gods? What is this senseless braying? The Seven Lords were &lt;i&gt;Eternals&lt;/i&gt;, just as I am.
*Growl at him to stop lounging next to the sea and to get moving - there&apos;s still fighting elsewhere on the island.*
First things first: I need to get the lay of the land inside Fort Joy. I was sent here to make an official report on what exactly goes on here, and I don&apos;t intend to run away now.
Oh, you know I do! Come closer so I can tell you... a little closer... &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt;.
It is knowledge you crave. You want scholars to bow in your presence, begging for truth in an age of lies.
*Assure Slane that you are still intent on freeing him.*
*Say even if he is dead, the world still needs a Divine... and you seek the Council.*
[ELF] *Cock your head. Ask if you haven&apos;t met her before.*

Waitin&apos; is sufferin&apos;.
Bonemail Drop
Just look at you! Struttin&apos; about like a peacock, but them feathers ain&apos;t yours. That face you&apos;re wearin&apos; - it don&apos;t sit right.

*Oh no, you&apos;ve no intention of letting him go. Unsheathe your weapon and attack.*
Those Voidwoken snared us just like a hunting pack. Not the most comforting thought...
*He frowns and crosses his arms across his vast belly, looking as petulant as it is possible for a troll to look.*
Wait- what are you doing? What&apos;s- what&apos;s happening? Here, stop! Please, stop!
*He stares into space and mutters to himself.*
*Grab your weapon. Tell him you&apos;re glad you came here today.*
*The amulet is a perfect fit, though nothing more happens. Perhaps it&apos;s missing something.*
Ours has been a story for the ages, hasn&apos;t it? You were nothing but a two-bit minstrel playing host to a carousel of visitors, and I was... well. I was doing quite well. But now, I&apos;m even better.
Here and there. She pays me some to bring those funny plants, long as I promise not to eat any of &apos;em. Don&apos;t know why I would. Smells nasty, like crocodile poo. And I&apos;ve smelled crocodile poo, so I know what I&apos;m talkin&apos; about.

*One barrel of fish stands out from the others. It&apos;s sealed and marked with a cross. Something about it seems... &lt;i&gt;familiar.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Hold out your purse. When he reaches for it, pull it back. With your spare hand, caress his cheek. Then grab him by the neck and knee him hard.*
*Ksst! Kshhhh...*
*Gasp - surely a brilliant investigator like him doesn&apos;t think you&apos;re a criminal? You&apos;re on his side!*
Then again, he&apos;s still looking.
Reduces the damage from physical attacks.
He should be allowed to rest - whatever his sins, he&apos;s been punished more than enough.

If you side with &apos;life&apos;, then you best keep to yourself. The louder you cry and the harder you pray, the closer to death you tread.
I know. But now she is weak I can speak truth.
They&apos;re... they&apos;re going to be alright...? Thank you. &lt;i&gt;Thank you&lt;/i&gt;. Gods above, thank you.

Rhalic aflame, that brew went straight to my bladder. If you&apos;ll excuse me...
*You recognise it as part of the Scion Daeyena&apos;s spore-armour.*
Alright... we should go wherever the God King needs us.
You see nothing but your own violence. The doors to you are closed. Braccus Rex is just.
*Ifan&apos;s spirit stares at you, seemingly &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; you. There is neither affection nor blame in his expression.*
Sebille taught me her scar-song. An honour for me... and insurance for her should we run into the Shadow Prince, her old master.
*Whispers...* Stay safe, you hear?
*Screaming, biting rage blazes across your mind and a great roar emerges from his mouth as if all the fury beneath the world was coming to burn the very earth, and in your mind the roar becomes a word:*
No thanks!

*Open your mouth to ask for more.*
It fascinates me just how many of you believe that your particular concerns should exempt you from passing the trials of the Path of Blood like any other pilgrim.
*The elf&apos;s spirit seizes you by the shoulders, but you feel nothing. His eyes are panicked and he appears to be shouting something, but you can&apos;t hear him.*
*In the second candle, you meet the soul of a murderer - an elf who specialised in abducting and disposing of lizard youths. He sold his soul to the demon to ensure the authorities would never find him.*

You are sworn to &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; Fulfil your oath. &lt;b&gt;Kill them!&lt;/b&gt;
*The point breaks away, leaving a jagged edge. The sword is shorter now, but it&apos;ll do more damage.*
Are you &lt;i&gt;watching &lt;/i&gt;this?
Am- am I still sleeping? I feel like I&apos;ve just  woke up, but- but this can&apos;t be real? Tell me this ain&apos;t real...
No problem, freshie! In that case, enjoy your stay. But... I&apos;ll be needing to collect your internment fee first, of course.
Reimond,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Work at the Blackpits is slow. Bring in a couple more of our &apos;friends&apos; to speed things along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And keep this quiet. I am getting far more questions than I would like. Remember, the fewer people involved, the fewer mouths we have to worry about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep me informed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Dallis

[UNDEAD] *Nod as if the phrase &apos;a lifetime ago&apos; means something to you.*
Excellent!
This is wonderful! Let&apos;s find a ghost - I have so many questions...

*Interject with a shout. This woman is dangerous. What is he trying to prove?*
*Snap your fingers, and tell her you remember now!*
Intruder!
Trading
[FANE] *Inform Lady Kemm that you are not quite up to date on &lt;i&gt;modern&lt;/i&gt; politics.*
Why, work of course. Anathema won&apos;t restore itself, I daresay. I shall finish what I started, aboard whatever remains of the Lady Vengeance in the Hall of Echoes.
UI Map Reset
Oh, but see - you&apos;ve riled the beast. And the only cure for the affliction... is &lt;i&gt;blood.&lt;/i&gt;
Come this way. But be quick.
*Walk away and leave the ghost in peace.*
Divine Favour
Ah! Looking for another trade?
*Note that he&apos;s doing his work with a strange amount of dilligence compared to the others.*
Yes, I&apos;ll take what&apos;s mine, thank you. But I&apos;m tired of criminals getting second chances around here!
Pin

I understand. Now tell me how your story ends.
Sentries! Until I give the word, hold your fire!

Amazing I&apos;m still here. That you&apos;re here - and that you might still speak. That Lucian...
I&apos;ll send a summons to the other Godwoken; they&apos;ll be awfully excited to see you did their work for them.
*You are Mrazxken the engineer. You keep the machine running and focused on its primary task. Just as your ancestors did, you await the answer to the great question: &apos;What is the Universe?&apos;*
[JESTER] *Make a sad face and draw a tear on your cheek with your finger. Maybe the pig should jog your memory?*
*Tell her you&apos;ve already found a suspicious letter. There may be further evidence in the debris.*
Hold
And then suddenly I&apos;m here, apparently facin&apos; the human inquisition.
*Ask him if he knows where Mordus is now.*
Then she has her prize whereas you were kept in the dark, ignorant of the fateful prophecy.
*Her eyes widen and shimmer, but she turns away before you can see any tears fall. When she turns back, her cheeks are dry and she shows no sign of sadness - or any emotion at all.*
*She arches what would be an eyebrow, if lizards had eyebrows.*
Black Candles
Of course it is. The truth&apos;s right there. Skin deep.
Ok
Is it... is it really dead? I feel like I&apos;ve got a tumbleweed where my thinker-nut used to be.
And to side with those thugs in Fort Joy against that innocent elf? What kind of &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; would do that, let alone a Divine?
