*The woman&apos;s spirit still holds her hands up protectively. Her eyes are filled with terror. Her lips move in a silent plea...*
*Tell him he&apos;s welcome. No-one deserves to die alone on the ground.*
I don&apos;t... I can&apos;t... I just need to talk to her. Ok?!
He could never have enough power. This place, and all its horrors... these were the fruits of his efforts, to unlock the secrets of Source, and bend them to his will... I helped him, to my shame...
[DWARF] *Say you&apos;d rather stick to singing old dwarven chants.*
[VILLAIN] *Tell him you&apos;ll show him sure in a minute if he doesn&apos;t get out of your face.*
Do you think I don&apos;t know what you are? Do you think I haven&apos;t felt that power? I know what your God promised you, whelp.
Hush now. Keep your peace!
Ah, come on, lad. I can take care of myself. As you can see.
*Brandish your own weapon; you&apos;re not used to letting threats slide.*
HELP! Help me, please!
Life&apos;s full of surprises. That&apos;s what makes it fun! And horrifying...
&lt;b&gt;You should know better than to give her hope - it will only make her spirit more delicious for us. She is nothing more than what we allow her to be.&lt;/b&gt;
The shadow itself: the House of Shadows.
*Malady groans, her face twisting in pain. She falls to one knee, catching herself on her hands.*

*You have the information you need. Take your leave.*
Lucian. A fine fellow he was, I admit. Showed me conjuring tricks at dinner parties when I was but a boy...
*Shrug and say that you don&apos;t particularly care much for art.*
Did you find something in the cave? Deathfog... a... a &lt;i&gt;bomb&lt;/i&gt;. Did you find it?
Death &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; eternal. So go: worship him into infinity as he sits on a cold, grey throne amid a worldwide necropolis.
But of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; it would be you.
Carefully navigate the maze.
*He kisses you like a man starved, then nuzzles into your neck, scratching your skin with his beard. It tingles. Wonderfully.*
Until next time, may the spirit of the One be with you.
SqueeEEEEEEEE! *Grunt*
Now I fight for the other side.
Let the games begin...
Voodoo Storm
*You&apos;re tired of the mind games. Lunge at the White Magister and show her what a Godwoken can do.*
Stew
Sadly, you&apos;ve overstayed your welcome. Allow me to show you the door.
*Uhhhhnnn...*
Wasn&apos;t enough, as it turns out. Voidwoken attack. I&apos;m told the queen is safe, though whether she&apos;s still inside, I can&apos;t say. *shudders* So many dead. At least the bride and groom survived.
You may recognise the people in it. Alexandar, of course, and your own Justinia, the dwarven queen. The great elven seer Tiriara and Ghonghi of the Ancient Empire, too.
It&apos;s hard to say whether this is magical or mechanical. Or both. You can probably put this thing to good use somehow...
*He blinks a tear away.*
*Masked and dressed to the nines in an opera house, moments before the curtain raises.*
The Seekers were born. We found Godwoken, housed them, fed them. I loved them like family. I was... naive.
A lizard... name of Hannag. Crazy smart. Crazy all round, really. She should get here from Paradise Downs any day now.
*The look in her eyes is grim as the collar around your neck starts to twist and warp. She wrenches her arms apart and, with a scream of tortured metal, the collar falls broken to the ground.*
*A disdainful smile creeps across the cook&apos;s face.*
[OUTLAW] *Proclaim that you&apos;re too quick on your feet for that to happen.*
Spirit of the Fanatic
Wriggling vines hold the target down. Target cannot move or teleport.

*Smile and say he&apos;ll be indistinguishable from a commoner in no time.*
*Tir-Cendelius nourishes himself from the Source that abounds in your presence. You feel it, deep down inside yourself.*
Very well... First you must know that I am a prince, &lt;i&gt;the Red Prince.&lt;/i&gt;
Save Sadha, my prince, I beseech you! Save your family that is our empire&apos;s fortune!
Perhaps these Seekers would know more. I imagine they are quite keen to leave too.
Attack your target with meticulous aim, dealing [1]  in one shot. When performed from Stealth, this attack gains a 50% damage increase.
[FANE] *Use the power of Divinity to bring back the Eternals, but leave the God King sealed away behind the Veil.*
So. You&apos;ve lied, then?
This- this is blasphemy! Don&apos;t look, Quercus. The forest will reclaim this hellscape when the time comes.
And thine were better? Couldst thou have brought forth such cunning use of light?
She&apos;s tuned me out. She&apos;s tuned everyone out - everyone but that advisor of hers, that Isbeil. Her quacking all but drowns us out.

Use it wisely, Divine.
*Exhale quickly, coughing and spluttering up the fumes.*
*Plant a gentle and honourable peck on her gloved hand.*
Bit strange to picture it, isn&apos;t it? To be rooted...

A prayer note - &apos;Blessed Lucian, help me find true love.&apos;
Dwarven Sword
Shhh, I&apos;m still praying. Something&apos;s gonna happen soon. I wish it&apos;d hurry up.
You will not.
*He hands you a mirror of the blackest glass.*
*Search her memories for what happens next.*
I&apos;m sure you have so many questions for me, but they can wait. First, I&apos;d like to introduce you to... an old friend.
*Growl!*
Enter as you please.
It wants me to find it...
*Kill Braccus, if you think you can.*
Meet Malady by the Doctor&apos;s house.
This murderer has taken his last life, I swear it.
Without you, we&apos;d be dead on that beach. My thanks, friend.
That smell... flesh not freely given. Stolen blood. Sickening.
I guess this is it for us. For now. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;ll all be over.
*Tell him Almira says he can fight his own battles.*
*Say you haven&apos;t found the fellow who can help you yet. Jahan, right?*
*The spirit of a Magister priestess kneels on the ground, her hands tied behind her back. She flinches as the ghostly sound of tortured screams from nearby catches your ear, and hers.*
Go on. Get t&apos;shoppin&apos;.
- that we may rise and live Eternal -
Troll Die
*Interesting. Ask how he crafts a shapeshifting mask, exactly?*
*Her face falls at the mention of her home. Her hands fly instinctively to her eyes, as if to wipe away tears, but she stops herself.*
*Dare her to try it.*
[IFAN] *Tell her she need not fear; nobody&apos;s given you a contract for her life.*
*The towering black-clad warrior watches the water, rapt in a religious fervour, talking to himself. To understand, you must listen close.*
*Taken somewhat aback by her surprising beauty, you nod and ask what you can do.*
As are so many. I pray you will be comfortable here.
*Thank her and say you&apos;ll deliver this to Atusa right away.*
*She pats the bouquet at her hip.*

The God King. He said if I could find Dallis, eliminate her, I could take my place by his side again. But Kemm... he doesn&apos;t like competition. All it took was a few whispers. They spread to the Magisters quickly.
Ungh...
Whatever place this once was, it was destroyed long before our - before &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;time.

Look, I&apos;m just trying to sell cheese here. I don&apos;t want trouble. So buy what you want and move on.
But &lt;i&gt;he &lt;/i&gt;still lives. The beast. The fiend. The Doctor. That cannot be allowed.
Hunters - I&apos;ve got the wares you need.
...exquisite.
Bring... my... my... champion.
Heh, fresh out of the crypt, are you? No, we are... abnormal. It&apos;s why we hide in the shadows.
Do you think I care about your self-pity?!
Removing the ring did nothing. I must find it a new host.
*She inches herself even closer on your lap, pressing her torso against yours. Her body is warm - warmer than yours, warmer than it should be, her weight a comforting anchor in this unfamiliar place.*
*Arhu looks to you. His face is a tortured mask of grief.*
The arena should be for good, honest fighters. Not the likes of Murga!

If you think I&apos;m kind of okay now, just wait &apos;til you meet Lohse &lt;i&gt;without &lt;/i&gt;a demon in her brain.
Just me? No? Yes? Never mind...
I came to the Wellspring to become Divine and save the world from the Void. Instead, Dallis and Vredeman stole the powers of the Seven and left the island crumbling.
[A collection of what seem to be template wedding vows. Some mention love, but quite a few read like legal contracts. Flipping through it you find one with two whole paragraphs on inheritance rights. It&apos;s circled in red ink.]
*The flames fade back into the past from whence they came. Syrus Oates gives you a long-toothed smile where his lips have burned away. But he does not scream.*
*Suddenly, you feel the thud, thud, thud, of her heart hammering against her chest - and into yours.*
Sounds like a fine lady indeed. For a dwarf, at least.
Yes, so we gathered. We found it strange that the King would refuse you the chance to explore something that could be so beneficial to our people...
*Say you&apos;re looking for Brahmos. Has he seen a Dreamer pass by?*
That&apos;s right, innit, legsy? Rules are rules; break the order, and you lose your place in it.
Someone must be clicking buttons and pulling levers...
*He nods respectfully in return, then focuses on Lohse once more.*

They proved themselves... zealots. Heartless.
I&apos;m Han. So, Sebille. You helped me out just there, so let me return the favour. You want to get out of here?
By Rhalic&apos;s blessing, I remain here.
All these fools think of Lucian as some kind of saviour. I want to know why he sacrifices my homeland.
*He&apos;s lying! He will rid you of your scar right now, or die!*
*His cruel, scraping, booming laughter echoes inside your mind as he shows you images of your torture and ultimate death. Time to die...*
May Rhalic ever watch over you.
Sword Kit Part II: Hilt
I&apos;ve made my peace with it, and you have too, or you&apos;re the worst merc I&apos;ve ever seen. Alright lads, we&apos;re out of here! Job well done! &lt;i&gt;Move out!&lt;/i&gt;
A chest of a decidedly elven nature. May have been stolen.
Alright then, done. But be quick about it.
Careful out there. There&apos;s been a Voidwoken attack just today.
*Gareth is still. For a moment, his mind wanders to memories of friends and enemies, of Malady and Magisters, of demons and Divinity. He is then present once more, though he speaks without a trace of emotion.*
*Tell the dog you won&apos;t tolerate any more of this self-pity. It&apos;s time to get on with life!*
*She turns to look you in the eye, impatience evident in her intelligent face.*
*Announce that Brack-us refuses to apologise.*
It&apos;s the &lt;i&gt;wheel&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;wheel&lt;/i&gt;, don&apos;t you see, you beautiful idiot! Squeaks whenever the helmsman jerks it clockwise, which means we&apos;re heading east.
Go, my love. I understand your reluctance. I will be here. I will take care of our child.
*Coldly tell him &lt;i&gt;Death&lt;/i&gt; is asking. And she&apos;s in a damn foul mood.*
