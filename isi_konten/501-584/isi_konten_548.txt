Where you go, the King follows. What you say, the King hears. You travel the edges of the Void, Godwoken. &lt;b&gt;See her dead, &lt;/b&gt;and your rewards will be many.
Encrypted Book
Lady Kemm is having tea in the drawing room over in the north wing. I&apos;m quite certain a person as obviously well-travelled as yourself will have no problem drifting in that general direction should he deem it fit to do so...
Outlaw
I am death and light... I take the Source inside... I am the inevitable end... I AM THE VOID ARRIVED...
Necrofire Infusion
*She bites her lip and leans in close. If she&apos;s bothered by the fleshless face she finds, she gives no sign. As she whispers, you almost forget where you are...*
A noble gesture from your warm soul, but misguided. For there are others in the world. &apos;Godwoken.&apos; The mortal champions chosen by the others.
*Shake your head and take your leave.*
Our Godforsaken World&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*In a tome so short as to be likely unfinished, Huwbert recounts the origins of Lucian’s Day. In short, a day of mourning for Lucian’s passing - in the year 1233 - has become a day of hope for his return.*
*Say that you don&apos;t answer to vagrant elves.*
*Wish him well and leave.*
*Wrest control back from the God and demand to know more about the device.*
Why make a mess if we don&apos;t have to?
The Lady Vengeance
War Crossbow
We&apos;ve braved the Joy and I lust for further adventure. What say you? Shall we continue our journey together?
That voice... the same one from before...
Yes... Blotted out by your Master. What a shame.
*The head&apos;s eyes widen in horror.*
*Squints...* Oh hey, you&apos;re right. You&apos;re a might uglier than that fella, now that I get a good look at you.
I saw a skull over there... there were fine, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;fine holes through every inch of it. Can you imagine how fine an implement he&apos;d have used?
Add containers
Clutches
You&apos;ll return. This, I know.
*It is &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt;. The secret of your soul. The unknown woman, as red-skinned as yourself.*
*The salamander&apos;s tongue flickers - tasting you on the air. It turns away with a grunt.*
Other
&lt;i&gt;Enough words!&lt;/i&gt;  Show me your steel!
[MYSTIC] *Tell her not to fear, you have seen the other side and it is &lt;i&gt;beautiful.*&lt;/i&gt;
*Play along and take her arm with a grin. Tell the children they must be mistaken!*
[ELF] *You know these vines. Look closer.*
...and I think you&apos;d make a pretty good god, if it comes down to it.
*Make a mysterious gesture and tell him you&apos;ve seen his future - and now is a really good time to re-evaluate his career choices.*
The portal will return you to Rivellon. May the fires that burn within you remain mighty!
As for me... my last hope of ever being freed of the God King&apos;s terrible tyranny faded when the Godwoken claimed Divinity. An eternity of pain and suffering is mine. I cling now to the dream that one day the Veil will be sealed. That one day I can be freed. That one day a new Godwoken will rise!
Will we master our powers and become truly Godwoken?
*Tell him you are a mere mortal, and he is clearly something... else. It does not do to compare his talents with yours.*
Create Poison Cloud
Thank the gods!
Blood Rose Seedling
This little key unlocks the doors to Arhu&apos;s apartment.
*Roar your displeasure. The queen is a monster. And she will be judged as one.*
I see the selfishness in you, and I wonder - do you know what it means to be loyal? Do you know what it is to be depended on? To &lt;i&gt;matter&lt;/i&gt; t&apos;someone?
*Tell her you found a bottle of the potion.*
After the first fresh shoots broke the earth, he disappeared, and was never seen again.
Count three paces, lizard. That&apos;s the distance you need to keep.
[ELF] *Remark that Alexandar is but human. If he&apos;s really all that&apos;s left, we&apos;re in dire straits indeed.*
*You feel your God tense and lunge - tearing out of your body, through your ribcage and onwards towards the frail figure.*
*Say he mentioned an enemy. Who did he mean?*
Lohse! Good to see you again.
Eh. I could let them live, but I&apos;m just in one of those moods.
*The vision appears - the dreamers escaping out through the garden and into... a pool. A figure accompanies them... an elegant female kin, with the reddest of skin.*
We can&apos;t turn back now. There are still S-seekers being held on the Lady Vengeance. And we&apos;re not safe here, either.
*Tell her she&apos;ll stand at your side after you ascend - and you&apos;ll make sure she&apos;s taken care of.*
*Say you&apos;ve found his &apos;oranges&apos; - or more accurately, his drudanae.*
Amyro
Overseer Chest Key
*The owl bows before you with an outrageously over-the-top flourish of her feathered wings.*
Juggling Apple
*The spirit acknowledges your presence with a slight bow, then turns her attentions to the candle in front of her. She does not respond to your attempts to speak.*
You&apos;re under arrest for assault!
*Lay a hand upon her shoulder and say you&apos;re touched by her loyalty. It will not go unrewarded.*
Mithridates
Such a pity. Perhaps he&apos;ll find freedom in the Hall of Echoes.
Here&apos;s a rather explosive little trick I&apos;ve developed. Let&apos;s see how it suits you.
Identify
Doin&apos; good for each other isn&apos;t politics. It&apos;s just... it&apos;s just &lt;i&gt;good, &lt;/i&gt;ya know? He stood up for &lt;i&gt;her;&lt;/i&gt; she stood up for &lt;i&gt;everybody. &lt;/i&gt;Least they both had love in their hearts. That&apos;s somethin&apos; not everybody&apos;s got.
&lt;i&gt;Do not say that name!&lt;/i&gt;
Hold it right there. Private wedding party. No entry.
Ball! Ball! EMMIE! ATTACK!
*Roll your eyes. Who&apos;s this kid think he is?*
Focus not on death and irony, my chosen: on life and ascension instead.
*Ask where you can find the amulet and scroll.*
It&apos;s about time. My soul rests inside the reliquary. I need but a drop of your blood to open it.
Smelly person threw my ball away and I couldn&apos;t go fetch! Threw it off the balcony! An&apos; I couldn&apos;t find it. But then Master Arhu came back! So that&apos;s nice! I love Master Arhu.
There&apos;sh... jusht one think I can think of. I hid shome thinks here... thinks I didn&apos;t want the priestsh to take...
*Say you&apos;d do anything for her.*
Murky Gloves
*The cat sighs sadly, and looks away.*
*His look now carries pure hate.*
Danna Dumora
*He dips his head in thanks, raises his index finger to his temple to say goodbye... then vanishes into the ether.*
Meat Golem
Large Strength Potion
*Pull the jar you found from your pack and show it to her.*
*As her warm blood spurts to cover your face, you are sated. A satiety you would never speak of. A satiety that momentarily fills the emptiness within you. Wait. Who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you? You... can&apos;t... &lt;i&gt;you can&apos;t remember.*&lt;/i&gt;
Gareth&apos;s Last Letter to his Mother
I hope this Seeker has the sense to die quickly and just stay dead.
Mountain - Big Plateau
...for drink has left the dwarven people vexed.
Guard
Hmm... someone worked hard to keep this place secret.
*Turn to leave.*
The cosmos agrees with you. Could it be... I don&apos;t know my own meaning? This emptiness...
Just another thief. Another &lt;i&gt;Magister.&lt;/i&gt;
Turtle
The undead knight Lord Withermoore offered us his help. Apparently we destroyed his Soul Jar and freed him from bondage.
Oops.
Ha! Wit&apos;s a fine weapon - you wield it well. My story is my own for now. Perhaps there will be more I can share, with time.
[SCHOLAR] *Note the elf&apos;s condition and quietly mutter that he&apos;s lost his senses from the pain.*
Oh, she&apos;s alright. A lot of bark, but I think she really cares about what we&apos;re doing. Better that than a sweet heart who&apos;d sooner watch you walk off a cliff than shout &apos;look out&apos;.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and the ghostly stag behind.
I&apos;ve already examined it and found it quite ordinary. What more could I possibly...
*Wave his request away and ask him what he knows about the murder on board.*
According to the recipe, the Eternals would call it Nazad Rivelleis.
Crime Scenes
Add Vignette
Ey, Fara, looney as ever, are ya?
*Insist that as a successful mercenary, you&apos;ve never had a single accusation of impropriety.*
I can&apos;t look at them... it&apos;s like someone&apos;s trod over my own grave...
Mosquito Swarm Skillbook
*Sporting a roguish smile, grab the front of her dress and tear it open.*
*Say that he&apos;s piqued your curiosity - what is this &apos;other place&apos;, where he&apos;d be more appreciated...?*
*Tell her you&apos;re sure.*
I know a way out. I show you. And you... you help me out of here. I cannot die in this cage.
We got through the ritual without creating a scene. The elves weren&apos;t impressed, but it could have been worse.
Only he who &lt;i&gt;claims&lt;/i&gt; everything will &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; everything. The Void&apos;s doom; this world&apos;s liberator.
*Say this seems a little strange. What kind of feedback is he after?*
We found dwarven thugs trapped in a hidden chamber. We fought them.
Broken Ladder
*Reply that it means nothing to you.*
Cavern Red
*Ask if you might help them settle their argument.*
A spark of life in this dead place. There is hope!
*The servant grumbles.*
&apos;uh-wo. Nice ball, innih?
Now go. There is only forward.
I know what you look like! I&apos;ll report you! Queen Justinia will have vengeance...
I see you. You do something wonderful. You take the spirit of a wicked man. An overseer. A man who takes my life. A man who ruins me.
*The bard opens his mouth to continue his poem, but another glance at your face has him choking on his own spit.*
*The news sets him aback. He recovers quickly, but his mood is dark, his voice quiet.*
Playing dead, are you? Probably a good idea...
Blood Rose Elixir
You&apos;ll yet be all, Lohse.
*Express your condolences about her having lost her family.*
May you always walk in wisdom&apos;s wake: the flower-strewn path of Amadia.
Shouldn&apos;t have let that Hannag woman near Gwyd. She said she could teach him. But that&apos;s when all the trouble started...
Quiet... Lucian speaks with me... I am his martyr...
*The black eyes churn with intrigue... then flash hungrily.*
Hmmm. Let&apos;s just say killing a bunch of lowly dwarves is... beneath me.
Elvish script. It&apos;s been a while since I read any, but these look like plans to attack the laundry... er, sawmill to the south. Guess I&apos;m not as rusty as I thought.
Next Hotbar
I led him here.
As fascinating as it would be to watch you flop about like a beached walrus, I would prefer not to.
*Ask what he&apos;ll do now.*
Pyrokinetic
The path is clear. We can leave for the Lady Vengeance.
*Fane cracks one knuckle after another as he prepares for the task ahead.*
*Bid them continue.*
Ice Fan
*Leave him to his macabre snooping.*
No! I can trust no-one - not even my own kin!
Hey there ol&apos; buddy ol&apos; acquaintance. Wanna team up again?
Beautiful maiden, do not tease me with what I cannot have...
*Press him for details - you&apos;ve never met a god before.*
*Ask him if he wants the shinies.*
*Ask what happened here.*
You returned to the world as the undead Godwoken who failed to become Divine. Did you accept your failure with dignity or did it destroy you?
It does get a little dull out here on my lonesome, you know. No harm in passing the time with a little tale.
*Hold out your hand. You&apos;ll take it.*
Potency
We knew Roost was an enemy, but the next person the Black Ring pays off may not be so obvious.
No sadder sight to the hungry adventurer than an empty bowl.
