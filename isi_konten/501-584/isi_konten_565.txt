Yes? I thought there was nothing further.
Believe me, this man is no more noble than an old boot.
I never did find Brahmos the Wanderer.
*Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;graveyard&apos;.*
*The spirit of a Magister stands before you. She smiles openly.*
Shame! Shame! Shame!

*The demon leans in and sniffs - breathing deep.*
Unf. That is one beautiful woman.
Again. This again. I sleep, then I wake, and another piece of the world is gone...
*Tell him that if he&apos;s about to ask for liquor, you can&apos;t accommodate him.*
Based on that letter, their plan was this: Lohar and his people sink a Magister ship, the Peacemaker. They transfer its cargo to the Victory. And then the Victory sails of to Duna knows where.

You &lt;i&gt;honour &lt;/i&gt;us.

Lightning Cascade
*Amidst a crowd of screws, bolts, and scraps of metal, the woman is manipulating a glove-like contraption fitted with five long, metal skewers. She doesn&apos;t look up as you approach.*
It&apos;s no use. It&apos;s too late...
Elven Longbow
A vicious end. Perhaps their flesh will explain what happened here.
Contrived from the scum of Rivellon&apos;s vilest troll&apos;s feet, witch&apos;s gums, and demon dung, this poison could take down a medium-sized wollock.
You will bow to me. Every vision that ensnared you let my claws sink deep into your soul.
After I am free, you are free.
Absolutely not. I don&apos;t give away sensitive information like that to anyone who just asks for it. And I don&apos;t keep it lying around, neither.
Altar to the God King

Other than the destruction of their homes, the deaths of their friends, and watching ancestral forest being turned into farmland?!
*The prisoner&apos;s eyes meet yours. He speaks not with gratitude, but with gleeful malevolence.*
*Ask what he means by &apos;get what they deserve&apos;.*
[LOHSE] *Say you&apos;re not a stranger; you&apos;re Lohse!*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and did nothing to help the spirit of Syrus Oates.
Good gods! What happened...
*Glower at her. Your name is Fane, and you strode this earth before her wretched species even existed.*
You&apos;re no stranger then, to her demon-wrought idiosyncrasies.
Shovel
Sister in undeath. You must help. I can be freed.
Meistr Siva&apos;s there, too. One of your kin. My leader - &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; leader.

Lohse&apos;s Blood Vial
*Give her the severed hand you found: is this hers?*
But you have been relentless. When I felt I might falter, you sallied forward.
Unless...
You&apos;re remarkably naive for someone your age, you know.
[HERO] *Implore him to remember the teachings of Lucian. Vengeance will only lead to misery for all.*

Keeping watch. Tending the graves.

Don&apos;t be silly.

Windego told us that Kemm keeps a Swornbreaker scythe somewhere on his estate - and that she intends to take it.

To be fair, Vrogir could show great empathy and tenderness when he wished... though that doesn&apos;t seem to have been very often.
You know the drill. Forgiveness is a lie. Failure is not tolerated.
These names... they&apos;re the ones who went missing... and others... &lt;i&gt;my name is on here!&lt;/i&gt;
The witch don&apos;t fool me - she wrecked this ship by herself. &lt;i&gt;With&lt;/i&gt; a collar on.
We decided that we couldn&apos;t trust Tarquin, so we killed him.
Caw... CAW! CAW! &lt;i&gt;CAW!&lt;/i&gt;
*He takes a gulp from his mug, but his eyes remain visible just over the rim, locked in a questioning stare.*
*You&apos;re not finished with Alexandar until nothing of him remains. Consume his Source.*
These schematics relate to the automaton. You cannot read the unfamiliar language the notations are written in, however.
Inactive Automaton
*Wave your hand in front of its eyes.*
Yow! I&apos;ll stop fidgeting when you stop jabbing me with your claws...
Curved like the moon and twice as shiny, this sickle can be used to trim crops or hack limbs.
The God King bade loyal servants place a &apos;weighty gift&apos; on an altar and pass beyond.
Griff doesn&apos;t know a way out of the fort. We&apos;ll have to try someone else.
Let mama see what you have to offer...
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast with the situation at Cullwoods Mill unresolved.
Well, keep your eyes open. You never know what lurks around the corner.
To stop Operation Downfall, Beast must follow the Peacemaker&apos;s cargo to the city of Arx.
Ring Of Fulfillment
*The statue thrums. You feel its power reach into you...*
[JESTER] *Tell him his show was great. You laughed at him, not with him.*
This was my dead father&apos;s house.
Like... like what? I don&apos;t know what you mean. It&apos;s just, I&apos;ve many connections in Arx, and I thought you might want the help... oh, by the darkness... What a, uh, funny misunderstanding!

Oh, but you think yourself so clever, don&apos;t you, beastie-boy? Fine - I&apos;m tired of pretending I serve this weak wench, anyway. But it doesn&apos;t matter. You can&apos;t stop the Deathfog. The wheels are in motion.
*Nod.*
He owes you his life. You have my thanks!
You&apos;re like I am, only far greater. I am but a limb, a branch where once there were many. You: you are &lt;i&gt;the heart&lt;/i&gt;.
Just report anything unusual that you see. We&apos;ll have that Sourcerer&apos;s head by evening&apos;s light. And Gods help anyone that aids him.
*Insist that you have no idea how that got in there. Maybe this is a set-up!*
That - &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is the ever-elusive mystery. These weren&apos;t escape artists. They were thieves and drunkards, imbeciles and liars, heretics and fools. The crudest of the crude, turned from slugs to smoke. &lt;i&gt;Poof.&lt;/i&gt;
NO! No more pain! I won&apos;t be vague! Go to Griff! Yes, go to Griff! He will know!
Kin! I&apos;m happy to report that the consulate no longer burns. Please, do accept my gratitude if you had a hand in this feat.
*Whimper*
&apos;Undead&apos; is a name I &lt;i&gt;wasn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; expecting to call you, mind. When Malady revealed the truth to me, I was... unprepared. But Lucian works in mysterious ways. It is his will that brought you to us.
*Say you&apos;re looking for Griff.*
[HERO] *Tell him you understand the grief that led him to the Order. But he shouldn&apos;t fear you.*
Dryad of the Mother Tree
*Frown. Whose fate is she deciding?*
Much obliged, guv&apos;nor! And here&apos;s your blend! Just take it to that big beauty of a pipe over there, and... have a blast.
A witch. Allow her to guide you, traveller. Now go. Follow the wind.
We met a man named Gareth. He told me that he is a Seeker - an ally of Sourcerers. He claims that he might be able to help us to escape this island. He told us of an hideout where we could meet again. It seems he has a plan to escape the island - one that involves seizing a Magister flagship.
*From the size and shape of the spirit you deduce that this is - or was - an imp. From its expression you deduce that it&apos;s not very happy about being dead.*
We need to end them. Yes, they will vanish. They won&apos;t go on to the Hall. They&apos;ll simply... cease to be. But if we don&apos;t do this, there will be no stopping Adramahlihk. This sea of candles will grow larger. He won&apos;t stop.
*Excuse yourself, sensing that the situation is about to escalate.*
*Nod. You won&apos;t stand in his way.*
Cash, eh?
Dwarven Warmaiden
*Two dwarven spirits, at loggerheads.*
&apos;They&apos; is them. Yes. Those. But not here. *Ahem* Too many ears. Ears everywhere. They hear things.
This is not quite the safest place I&apos;ve ever been...
*thk*
The parasite told me that the other Godwoken are helping their gods. To reach the Well of Ascension first, I must grow in power.

Hullo miss! Do you see the light reflecting off everything? It&apos;s magical down here, truly magical!
Peep peep?
Then you leave us to die. You leave her.
None could resist the God King. The world is his once more.
Good thing we have the lovely Lady Vengeance on our side.
[BARBARIAN] *Grip your nose tight - these fish stink worse than bodies in the sun!*
Ah! You&apos;ve met with what&apos;s left of Siva, have you? I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; very glad you&apos;re familiar with my work.
So they killed him. My &lt;i&gt;friend&lt;/i&gt;. It was then I knew that they&apos;d gone too far. It was then that I realised what I had been party to.

*Tell him you&apos;ll ensure his trust is well-placed.*
*Smile and say that you&apos;ll be right back.*
*Say yes: Let&apos;s get out of here.*

Lohar marked our map and asked us to kill Mordus.
Madam,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As requested, I have carried out thorough trials on the impish pyramids and have drawn the following conclusions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Using one pyramid teleports you to the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Connected entities will follow whoever has initiated travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) You can use a pyramid while holding it in your hand or interacting with it while it rests on the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Touching a pyramid isn&apos;t sufficient to use it; one must access its other functions by another method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is all I have discovered, thus you may assume this is all there is to discover about these particular relics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tarquin
A vandal &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a liar! I&apos;ll enjoy killing you twice as much...
*Growl that you don&apos;t care about missing Magisters.*
[RED PRINCE] *The &lt;i&gt;Shadow&lt;/i&gt; Prince? Sounds interesting. Ask where can you find him.*
*Joy and sorrow? Plea with the flower to divulge the meaning of its words.*

Goodbye, my child.

You dare interrupt Braccus Rex?! How... novel. &lt;b&gt;WHO ARE YOU TO CHALLENGE THE SOURCE KING?!&lt;/b&gt;
Forest - Big Cemetery
I am blessed, red-sunburst. I glide on Lucian&apos;s breath and feed on his sighs and smiles. For him, I would walk the Path of Blood. He needs only sing the command.
*Offer to give him a hand.*
Perhaps you are right. Perhaps there is another path.
Who knows what we may find here. The captain&apos;s compass, perhaps...
Egg Cluster
I do not know.
We climbed down the hatch.
Aerotheurge
*Shake your head and stand your ground. You can hear her just fine from here.*
*Ask if he knows how the Magisters intend to cure people of Source.*
*Ask her where she thinks you should head next.*
What can I do you for? How about a little amber? My boy Kniles&apos; favourite. He&apos;s a physician in the Divine Order - mother&apos;s pride!
Surrender yourself to your god that he may right your wrong.
*Loudly tell her you&apos;ll say nothing about the whole being turned into a cow thing.*
*The Magister looks up as you approach.*
It was an honour to perish in your service, Godwoken. The Seven will guide me to a better place.
*The owl&apos;s eyes go wide and round, as round as his roly-poly body.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll buy her a drink in the nearest tavern.*
Really? You think I&apos;m going to tell you? You figured you&apos;d just wander up here and ask nicely, or maybe use some hocus-pocus?
The distance you can run with one action point.
*Pull your hand back.*
*Reach for the release mechanism. Forget the others; you just want out of here.*
*Chuckles* No, I was not one to keep drawings by my child in a place of work.
