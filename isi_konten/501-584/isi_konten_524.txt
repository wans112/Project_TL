I served the Magisters for years, with utter loyalty. But they banished all but humans from their ranks. I won&apos;t abandon them though - they still need me!
*She reaches out, hovering her hands over your collar. As she furrows her brow the metal starts to twist and contort. With a scream of tortured hinges, it falls broken to the ground.*
*The Magister&apos;s stare hardens into an intense scowl.*
*The dwarf lies in a heap on the floor, his great beard twisted and tangled around him. He is stock-still; you can&apos;t see if he&apos;s living or dead.*
Chewed Earth
*Avoid his eyes.*
* - and then she is gone.*
You! Intruder! Baddie! Sourcerer! Stop! Go! Die! Bark! Bark! Bark!
Enemies attacking you with melee weapons will take half the damage they deal to you as piercing damage.&lt;br&gt;Your chance to hit: [1]%&lt;br&gt;You may start bleeding as you activate this stance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lasts until cancelled or replaced by another stance. Requires a shield.
Begone, dwarf.
[SCHOLAR] *Note that scholars everywhere have forever sought the secrets of happiness... and that perhaps they may have found it in the search itself.*
More junk.
Marksman&apos;s Fang Skillbook
Shh, shh, little Peeper baby, Mama&apos;s here and warm and here with you again.
*She nods, wide-eyed at the very thought of it.*
&lt;i&gt;Alarm!&lt;/i&gt;
Ngh... curse these snakes! Curse these binds!
Repulser
She alive? I&apos;m impressed. Magister Whozit laid into her pretty hard.
*You move to help your friend but stop short. It&apos;s the elf woman, crouching behind Thews with her chains broken. She spits a phrase: &apos;&lt;i&gt;Chm&apos;r doran&lt;/i&gt;!&apos;*
*The seven conspirators release their grip, and you move to retaliate - but there will be no retribution. Not now.*
Let the Ancestor show you. You are the first. Never to serve again -
Madam,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your techniques have proven most effective. A true marvel! Odd that the Source King had this technology so long ago, but managed to keep it quite secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the technical matters: The monks do listen, but they are so listless and dull. They respond, but they do not engage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would it not be possible, perhaps better, if they obeyed of their own accord? My mind races with the possibilities: Obedience through free will â€“ a will shaped by the Order itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then we might at last have the army the Divine dreamed of, may his spirit rest in peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours forever in service,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orivand
Reaper&apos;s Coast
You will pay.
You may well have that potential, but at the same time - hmm, how to put this...

*His eyes close and his head sags forward.*
LOGBOOK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magister Jeraldine Ridder&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day 230&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucian leading charge to front. Heading toward elf lands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day 231&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucian parleyed with Damian. No peace for father and son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day 232&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had no idea about Death Fog. Everything dead. Everything. Black Ring - but Lucian too. What?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day 233&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning to Arx. I guess we won.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the defeat of the Black Ring, people thought peace had finally come, but then the Voidwoken started appearing.

Let&apos;s see what you&apos;re made of...
Big Tomorrah told us the Deathfog crates in the sewers belong to the dwarves.
You ever think about... running off, like Barmby and Sam did?
Oh, &lt;i&gt;really?&lt;/i&gt;
Look away from the past and into the future, Lohse. There is so much work left to do.
I will grant you my blessing, fierce wolf. It will aid you on the path out of this place. And then... we will have words again.
*Wonder what his &apos;work&apos; might be. You didn&apos;t think nobles had jobs.*
Amadia&apos;s blessings, child. So you are the one who returned Gareth to his flock?
*You warmly tell the tale of Visha, but despite your best efforts, you notice that your knowledge of legends and monsters is somehow upsetting the child.*
As I said, Not-Mumsy - you&apos;ll need the song forrr that.
*You&apos;re ready to get out of here. Tell Han it&apos;s time to go.*

*Try the last thing the sleeping man said - &apos;Arx&apos; and &apos;Lucian&apos;s Day&apos;.*
I am Ifan ben-Mezd, famed Silver Claw of the Lone Wolves. My mission is to infiltrate Fort Joy and kill Bishop Alexandar of the Divine Order.

[LIZARD] *Tell her that in the Ancient Empire when thieves are caught with gold, it&apos;s melted and poured down their throats. You&apos;d be happy to demonstrate...*
Spirit of Bridgekeeper Mari Pruitt
Etched along the blade of this ornate dagger is a quote from the famous Ancient Empire love poet Farshid: &apos;Your eyes pierce me deeper than any blade ever could.&apos;
I go to Kemm. Or... his estate, rather. He&apos;s got a Swornbreaker scythe. It&apos;ll free me from the Covenant. I&apos;d be mortal, yes. But no longer a slave.
You&apos;re Godwoken, ain&apos;t yeh? You&apos;ve a certain something about your aura.

*Tell him to stop packing. Arx is safe from the Deathfog.*
The Razzle Dazzle can inflict blind in a [1] radius.

*The swaggering rowdy stops dead in her tracks, a look of dubious recognition on her filthy face. She smiles uncertainly, gold teeth flashing for the briefest moment.*
Step away from the prisoner, redscales!
*Sneer that an inmate with respect for authority is a fairly pitiful sight to behold.*
*She rushes over to you, quickly plants a kiss on your cheek, and dashes off to Jahan.*
Ho there, fellow traveller, &lt;i&gt;luronta&lt;/i&gt;. Looking for some cheer to lighten the mood of this grim city?
*Kiss her.*
*Level with him. His daughter&apos;s new husband wants him dead.*
The Hall of Echoes
*Wonder who this Brahmos is that he is to seek out.*
You were right, mistress. He &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;an imbecile.
*Pull the helmet off.*
You make quite the mess. And I&apos;m afraid I have no patience for vandals.
*The ritual has failed. The structure lies in ruins. But you have, at least, survived. You should feel relief. Disappointment. Confusion. Anything but the rage that wells up from deep within you.*

Thievin&apos; was the best chance I had of keepin&apos; afloat in this wretched city. Never thought that would mean tryin&apos; to impress a band of urchins, let alone getting crushed by a damned golem.

*You can feel a cold fear settle in Amadia&apos;s heart. She retreats inside you, curling up defensively.*
Magister Metamorph
*Tell her you did what she said; you attempted an exorcism. But it didn&apos;t go as planned. The demon resisted.*
Be silent!
Explore Mordus&apos; cellar.
*The ground under your feet trembles, as if an enormous beast has landed next to you.*
*Tell her you&apos;ll keep an eye out, but you have your own matters to attend to.*
I&apos;ve no sympathy for demons - including &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.
You are no eagle. No Master either. No friendship for you here.
*Blame humans. They brought strife, and left only a ruin in their wake.*
*A feeling looms inside you.*
*Demand the armour. You&apos;ll put it to better use.*
Create Fire Cloud
The race of lizards, all of us...
The Scroll of Atonement is in Sanders&apos; desk, upstairs from his shop. Writing &apos;Giyora&apos; on the parchment will unlock the desk.
We owe it goooooold! Hahahahaaaaaaa!
*Beast looks to the ground for a moment - but just a moment. His cheeks rise and redden, and he roars in laughter.*
Healing!
You can move heavy items by increasing your Strength or investing points in Telekinesis.
[VILLAIN] *Roar in ecstasy. You are Godwoken. &lt;i&gt;This is your time!*&lt;/i&gt;
Sometimes a strong hand is needed to move forward. I don&apos;t want to go where the Magisters are leading, but... I can understand them.
Tock! Ta-tock!
I have neither lungs to drown nor a stomach to poison. This ship&apos;s fate does not concern me.
Invisibility
Ignition Scroll
Then you&apos;re finished. The demon will destroy you and who knows how many more - all because you couldn&apos;t do what you needed to do.
That&apos;s all I could ask for, now that the farm&apos;s safe again.
You better. That&apos;s... reassuring, actually. I can&apos;t say I know everything she&apos;s got planned. But I know she&apos;ll do anything she can to halt the revolution. Who knows how many lives she&apos;d end to see it done...
Greaves of Contamination
Wouldn&apos;t count on that. Not when I find out who&apos;s been blabbin&apos;.
Coward! Spineless coward!
Make tracks - the dead walk Rivellon!
*Tell her the world is better off without an almighty tyrant.*
Now, answer the security question.
*Remark that the wedding must have cost a pretty penny. He&apos;s sure he doesn&apos;t have more to spare?*
Ifan! Good to see you again.
She risked her life for us... and lost it, too. No-one has helped us more on this journey. We owe her a great deal.
And what kind of Divine was the Red Prince, as the world battled on?
Rather &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt; sometimes, to travel by oneself. We could see where the road takes us together, if you like.
You&apos;re coming with us, then. Maybe you&apos;ll learn some respect for the rule of law in Arx...
Memorised Skills
*Leave them to it.*
Please, you have to help me. The Magisters have gone mad!
No matter, we&apos;ll always have our first kiss... I haven&apos;t been quite able to put it out of my mind... just as I&apos;m sure you won&apos;t be able to put &lt;i&gt;me &lt;/i&gt;out of your mind.
*She looks pensive. Something on her mind?*
*Say you need to be going.*
*Say that it wasn&apos;t worth it. Too many innocents died in the process.*
The Doctor isn&apos;t available for house calls apparently.
*Wonder who would make such a thing: who is the original creator?*
Wyvlia
*The Advocate, whom you met on Bloodmoon Island, stares at you, wide-eyed and mad. And then you realise that he is changed - there are two open sores where his eyes used to be.*
*Ask him to remind you what he&apos;s asked of you.*
*The spirit vanishes, leaving only the fading echo of a final scream.*
Haven&apos;t you done enough harm already? Stay away from me.
Carved from wood, bark and tree; Born of fire, blazing heat; Fueled by oil, dark and raw; This rune of flame from ashes draws.
You want meat &apos;n&apos; bread? Head to the sewers. Those fancy dwarves down there are gorging on the good stuff!
In desperation, Hannag swore herself to a &apos;King&apos;, and agreed to die to be reborn. Then she attacked us.
[BEAST] *Tell him you may not know art, but you do know nonsense. This is the latter.*
[SCHOLAR] *Recognise the aphorism as one of Lucian&apos;s own and reply with another: &lt;i&gt;&apos;The most powerful weapon of all is a man with a friend to strive for.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
I&apos;m on the right track. That tablet Ryker wants has to be close.
I don&apos;t know quite &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;just yet. But then, I&apos;m not the Divine. Yet.
*The guard&apos;s face flushes deep crimson.*
Kemm is dead.
All those poor dead elves have haunted my dreams ever since the war. I thought I&apos;d be forgiven. I thought I&apos;d suffered enough... I was wrong.
A Taste of Freedom
She could die?! If only someone had told me. I would have ended her misery long ago.
Meistr Siva of the Seekers can guide us on our quest. We must hurry to her.
I understand! And, might I add, I quite echo your opinion.&lt;br&gt;
Oh, hi there!
*Deftly change the subject.*
And die with my guts slipping through my hands? Please, have a little class.
Arran, the Raucous One
She will survive, mother. She who is the mother of us all.
*Demand to know who you&apos;re speaking to.*
*Tell them you may have (definitely did) accidentally (on purpose) drunk the potion.*
Your ambition led you to the right end, but the wrong path. A pity the Dreamer can no longer bring you to where I sleep in the Hall of Echoes.
