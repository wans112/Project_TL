Say what you will about the Divine Order. Say what you will about the Bishop and the Hammer. They&apos;re the only ones looking after us now that the Divine is dead.
*From the stinking, nauseating, sickly sweet feeling that washes over you, you understand that he approves. You see an image of the future - your own self, presenting him with Alexandar&apos;s head.*
Ouch. Now my scales are singed.
*Xhaxh&apos;s Source flows out of the jar, across your skin, and into your eyes. For a brief moment you glimpse the universe, and then it&apos;s gone. You&apos;re left panting, filled with incredible power.*
Unlucky. But then, what do I know about luck anymore?
That trick doesn&apos;t work on me. You&apos;re under arrest!
And after I do, you&apos;ll not see this decaying corpse again. Farewell.
BOCK!
Your spirit is fitting one of our kind. You are resilient. A true dwarf, deep in your bones. But you have our weakness, too: You are too proud, too eager.
Burning status is ignored. Still taking damage from fire attacks.
Welcome to the Joy, my famed friend.
Hands to yourself, just this once. PLEASE.
Until we meet again, Prince.
Source Warfare Skillbook
*Remark that you&apos;re aware that Alexandar is on the island, and ask what he thinks of that.*
*Assure him that you&apos;ll keep your eyes open.*
*Tell her you found a destroyed Magister caravan outside town.*
Sweet dreams. Now let&apos;s get out of here.
I don&apos;t remember &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the questions, but I remember enough to give you a Lone Wolf name if you want one. So, tell me this: which of these scenes attracts you the most...
&apos;Ros Boutique: Luxury Goods &amp; Rarities.&apos;
*The Doctor turns to your companion after the late Divine falls, lifts a blood vial, and taps it to make a dull clink - a chilling reminder of the pact they made.*
What? Where are you going? No - come back, damn you!
There&apos;s no accounting for taste, I suppose. Or sense.
I know your type. You blindly ricochet from one conflict to the next, stirring the pot while scolding the virtuous. You believe in your own honour. But you&apos;re a fraud.
No, the Shriekers come from an ancient time. Something Braccus uncovered on his own. Powerful weapons, but too reliant on Source. One purging wand could take them down.
Dallis, the Hammer
The earth quaked and split open, a-and a great pestilence came down upon us, along with a host of &lt;i&gt;Voidwoken&lt;/i&gt;.
[SEBILLE] *Tell him your heart&apos;s not in this. It has been too cold for too long to stir passion.*
That so? Well then. Prove it. Down the hatch with you.
*Mention Karon, the Mistake. You know it&apos;ll evince a look of horror on Gareth&apos;s face.*
Electric Skin
When we lost him... well, it only made sense to see his will through.
*They seem to have been trapped here for a long time. Ask if you can help.*
Fran, I missed yeh, so I did. Let&apos;s not part ways again, girl.
The Doctor appeared, Lohse in tow, to claim our Divinity.
They say the One is a living god. You prove yourself worthy in the arenas, and you get divine power.
Can you believe the prices these thieves are charging? It&apos;s treason, if you ask me. Still, we&apos;ll muddle through.
&apos;Vilnx Creeva&apos;... almost sounds like a lizard name... but here?
*An &apos;Eternal&apos;? What is that, some sort of cult?*
I know what you are. And I can help you.
*Ask the troll why he&apos;s guarding the cave.*
*Say you&apos;re sorry about leaving him behind back on the sinking ship.*
Michal Zoldak
Death without your soul is no death at all, my friend.
A slow and painful death, no doubt. Messy, too.
I&apos;m sure it&apos;s a tale you&apos;ve heard before. And I&apos;m sure it has the same twist: &apos;...and then there were Voidwoken.&apos;
Mage&apos;s Pants
Abyssal Void Flayer
Shoot a stunning bolt of lightning that forks up to [2] times in a [3] radius and deals [1] to each target.
Spectral Nun
Void revenants... my &lt;i&gt;gods. &lt;/i&gt;And I thought I&apos;d seen it all.
*Take a step closer. You never know: maybe something&apos;s amiss!*
May the fallen rest easy in the Hall of Echoes.
You have already set loose some of the powers locked within you, but there is a great well of possibility as yet untapped.
Antiques and antiquities! Buying and selling!
*Remind him that he didn&apos;t know. The consequences are Lucian&apos;s fault, not his.*
*When her time comes... Say you don&apos;t like the sound of that.*
Our finest pupil visited us, under the guise of friendship. We feasted. He raised a toast - but did not drink. It was only when I fell to the floor that I realised he had &lt;i&gt;poisoned &lt;/i&gt;us.
Use
You want to buy something or not?
*Despite his disorientation, the spirit seems to sense looming oblivion. He closes his eyes.*
I cannot read the future, child. I live still, see... how else would we be in conversation?
Elemental Vulnerability
Medium Thunder Rune
*Point out that he&apos;s not the first of the God King&apos;s allies to face you. They fell, and so shall he.*
*Say that&apos;s probably for the best. You&apos;re better off apart.*
*Greet him with a whoop and a punch to the arm.*

Is that... her eye?! Did she pluck out her own eye?!
Your questions can wait.
You are ok. You are yours. No-one else&apos;s.
*Cry out that you&apos;re being framed. How on earth did that get in there?*
[ELF] *Bow your head. It is an honour to meet her.*
Do not be fooled by his cries. Karon was - is - a potent foe. He took to the sky as if on wings of pure Source. I might think a wyvern were attacking, had I not seen for myself his raging eyes.
I think that&apos;s for the best. Don&apos;t you?
*The lizard Magister - or what&apos;s left of her - lies in a puddle of gore.*
AwhooooooOOOOOO!
*Gareth&apos;s voice echoes throughout the enclave with such command, it could rouse a fawn to action.*
*She looks at you as the pain builds, and in her eyes you can see her question the point of it all - *
Cornflower
The wizard&apos;s eyes snapped up from the heavy tome. Outside the small hut, the unmistakeable sound of a struggle erupted, and an orcish roar sent shivers down the wizard&apos;s spine. But now was not the time for fear. By the light of the moons, the orc&apos;s hulking silhouette was a boil upon the outline of the peaceful woods. He had pinned someone beneath one great knee, and the victim cried out in futile anguish. The wizard whistled. Turning its great head, the orc had only just noticed the distant figure before its great green mass erupted into a shower of ash. The would-be victim rose, dusting the orc from his hair, and held out a hand. The signet ring of the Order of the Source Hunters glinted upon his finger. &apos;Friend,&apos; he said, &apos;I was sent to find the great wizard of these woods. But it seems you found me first.&apos;
Not bad, eh?
Game Over
Smelly man smells a bit like you. Are you mean too?
Ngh, yes, that&apos;s the spot.
*Sob...*
Someone else reported back to Magister Julian. The investigation is over.
A massive sword, its blade patterned with nicks and scratches. An excellent sidekick for bartering, threatening or general intimidation purposes.
Your people, on the other hand, seem quite content to sit about in smoky hovels held together by straw and filth.
Possessed Sourcerer
Hold up. I&apos;m on the hunt for my stolen property. Surely you won&apos;t mind if I look through your belongings.
&lt;i&gt;I see you. &lt;/i&gt;And inside you is the strength I&apos;ve been looking for.&lt;br&gt;
The Doctor will see you now.
A sneaky bow strung with unusually taut sinew; you just can&apos;t get enough of the sultry twang it makes as it releases arrows.
What could &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;possibly have to say to &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt;
I fear that it is. But you must steel yourself - the fight is not yet done.
*Ask what they&apos;re talking about. What&apos;s a shame?*
*Ask if the voice in her head is saying anything to her now.*
Small Flame Rune Of Power
*She searches your face for the truth. Satisfied, she turns away. But her guard is up.*
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast. We&apos;ll never know if there was a tale behind the strange lamp.
[UNDEAD] *Agree with a smile that some things are, indeed, &lt;i&gt;best left buried. &lt;/i&gt;Then take your leave.*
*You grab the plank and &lt;i&gt;pull&lt;/i&gt;. The rusted nail pops loose - and the plank promptly crumbles to pieces in your hand.*
Do not come too close. My own demons haunt me too closely. I cannot also bear the burden of yours.
She&apos;s... delicate at the best of times. I asked Simone for somethin&apos; to help her relax, but Gareth&apos;s the only one who truly keeps her calm.
Get away from me.
[OUTLAW] *Say that version of you is long gone.*
*Order the facts: They brought a dangerous Sourcerer here, who brought down Voidwoken upon their farm?*
Map
The Void has been pushed back before, by the power of mortals. The gods couldn&apos;t handle it... but maybe &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; can.
Let me show you what happens to thieves around here...
*A floorboard creaks beneath your foot. The elf leaps around abruptly.*
Rattus Contrarius
[SCHOLAR] *Remark that he seems like a clever sort - surely he must appreciate why unanswered questions about him continue to bother you.*
All because of this...
*Demand that she focus - you can&apos;t help her if she won&apos;t help herself.*
*Lohse leans back slightly, thin arms crossed in front of her chest, and stares at you defiantly from dark eye sockets - darker and deeper-set than when you first met. She blows back a lock of white hair, matted with sweat and grime, and holds back a smile from the corners of her lips.*
Very well, perhaps we would be wiser to wait. She shall not die today.
And your presence protects mine, which is the whole point of journeying side by side.
*Muse that it seems a reasonable question - he could leave for Driftwood any time he wants.*
*Grunt* I&apos;ve... got it!
To charge the amulet with Source, it must be worn. Source acquired will go to the amulet.
Lizard&apos;s Bow
*Ask why he&apos;s showing you a figment of your imagination.*
*The spirit recoils from you, but it&apos;s too late.*
*Ifan gives you a sheepish look, all flinty eyes and hunched shoulders.*
Bye now!
What&apos;ll it be?
*Ask how it happened that they&apos;re facing two such different enemies at once.*
Sourcerers are like the Divine&apos;s children - if you&apos;re harming them in here, we&apos;ll...
The Void steals everything beautiful from us. It is hungry for everything worth having.
*Lie back on the ground, you want him to leap on you.*
I have faced many curs and creatures in battles, but never ones like those.
*Ask the spirit what happened to him.*
*Ask him where he will look for Sadha in Arx.*
I wonder what Malady might have made of it all...
Any last words, traitor?
They Shall Not Pass
[VILLAIN] *Shrug. You don&apos;t care about his stupid bridge. But you bet you could fetch a good price for his skin in the more rarefied markets of the world...*
*Say you&apos;ll do your best to aid him.*
Tenebrium Resistance
Someone healed me... I was bound for death, a-and they saved me! It&apos;s a miracle!
An illusion. This fellow must be quite proud of himself.
It would, of course, be laughable to even contemplate that you - you who left me to drown in the darkness of a sinking ship - could be that emperor. The inference would be you&apos;re worthy of a position higher than a doormat.
Good day, sister! Interested in Driftwood&apos;s finest catch?
*Tell her you don&apos;t answer to Ryker.*
