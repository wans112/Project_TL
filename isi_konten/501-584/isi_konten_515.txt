Many people to meet. Many stones to turn. And there is a great joy here, as though the walls and water themselves were made by many smiling gods.
*Ask if there aren&apos;t real criminals to pursue instead of innocents like yourself.*
I&apos;ll be damned to the Void, but it looks like the Lady Vengeance has life in her! Malady&apos;s raring to go, and I can&apos;t say I&apos;m keen to keep floating to nowhere. Let&apos;s move!
You are &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt;.
*Tell her she did not heed her lookout&apos;s warning - her own ghostly crewman still rings his bell.*
*Source washes over him: a wave over a single flame, but unlike last time it seems to have precious little effect.*
*Grumble that there must be something of value around here...*
Have it your way, then.
Human graves. May the dead stay forever at rest.
*Ifan laughs, full and throaty.*
I pray they do not think to try to use it.
What&apos;ll it be, thrall? A bow? A few feet of sharp steel?
We met the spirit of Magister Harrick, who&apos;d gone missing in Driftwood. It looks like she was murdered in the kitchen of the Black Bull.
*Ask him again where the Doctor lives.*
*Wonder what crime he committed, to wind up in this place.*
And stranger... thank you, for freeing me... I had doubted this moment would ever come...
Huntsman Skillbook
Defeat! The artefact has been claimed!
Explore the altar room.
Yeah, you don&apos;t get to keep what you took. But you&apos;re not just walking away.
Haven&apos;t seen any of those around.
What in blazes? Something&apos;s pounding on the hull!
Like I said. You want someone who can keep you alive through means both natural and supernatural?
Web
Were you truly in such a hurry to die?
I couldn&apos;t be happier to be out of these, but... where are we?
Begin
...But Quercus said we could do more. He said we should push on.
We made it out alive... more than I can say for the lost souls littering the deck.
Synchronize with Steam
Only I have the will, the strength to do what is necessary. And now that those traitors Dallis and Vredeman have no influence over me, the way forward is clear.
What... what have you done?
*Say that hardly matters anymore; the culprit&apos;s dead.*
Elven Scion&apos;s Arm
Keep your distance, snakeface. Any false moves and I&apos;ll lay you out next to that elf.
Thanks very &apos;uch. That&apos;s &apos;etter. &apos;uch &apos;etter. &apos;ut still, and I don&apos;t want you to think I&apos;s going on a&apos;out this, DON&apos;T O&apos;EN THE CHEST!
&apos;It&apos;s a cat-has-trophy.&apos; Heehee!
*Crackle*
They most certainly are &lt;i&gt;not!&lt;/i&gt; But so long as you do not pledge allegiance to the Ring, we can talk. Perhaps even trade.
*Tell her not to be so childish. Out with it!*
Divinity will be mine and mine alone!
Place this box at the heart of the Mother Tree and return to me when you&apos;ve done so. I&apos;ll take care of the rest.
Welcome, my friend. Enjoy the quiet while it lasts!
There&apos;s a place to the north called Bloodmoon Island. I guess it&apos;s been more or less lost to a demonic presence for some time now. There&apos;s a fellow there - goes by the Advocate - and our new pal Jahan would like to see him taken care of.
*Alright, that&apos;s enough.*
Is that a fact? And your voice? You rip that from them too?
*Change your mind. He can have the parts - but no funny business.*
*In the low lamplight, the wider world fades away. Sweat glistens where your bodies meet. There is nothing but wonder: eyes, hands, and tongues.*
*Cut the introductions short and demand Isbeil divulge her intentions.*
Due to your vigilance, all of the Magisters here were, er, &lt;i&gt;&apos;investigated&apos; &lt;/i&gt;for their collusion with the Black Ring.
Keep huntin&apos;, wolfie.
*Tell him to relax. You are who you say. Word got back to the Fort about his predicament; you&apos;re here to help him.*
Get &apos;em!
Yes? What about them?
That&apos;ll be a no.
*The puppet shudders into life and recoils from your assault.*
Ancient Tome of Body Mastery
Get rid of the Djinn and the lamp.
*A power pulses, pulses, pulses and explodes within your soul.*
[LOHSE] *Sit down beside the woman and start to hum a gentle, soothing melody.*
Fane? Fane!
You know what I mean, lizard.  The dwarves and elves are no better. The lot of you would drag us all into oblivion with your blind devotion to Source.
Now is the time, my child. OPEN THE VALVE.
I&apos;m waiting.
*She mumbles something you don&apos;t quite catch.*
Case of the Possessed Child
*Tell Malady the figurehead is branded with a living scar - the kind lizards have used to control you...*
*Note the area&apos;s level of destruction. Surely the monks did not do all this.*
*Take the deal. You&apos;ll find the Godwoken, kill them, and purge their corpses.*
Mmm, wonderful smell on this volume. The musty aroma of knowledge.
&lt;i&gt;Look at us.&lt;/i&gt; We are all that remains.
The pleasure... is mine.
Flesh Sacrifice

Prefers to turn the tide of battle from afar, manipulating foes with powerful magic
My, my. Talk about still waters.

Tear open a portal to the Void at the cost of your own life.
Wind Deep Forest 03
*The Advocate? Say you don&apos;t even know who that is.*
*Crack your knuckles. Malady&apos;s a friend. What&apos;s she gotten herself into?*
&lt;i&gt;Everyone &lt;/i&gt;knows your name. It is cursed across every plane of existence. Fane the Heretic. Fane the Damned. Fane the Traitor.
Ha! Sure - I&apos;ll just mosey along outta here. Boy oh boy, but you&apos;re a laugh and a half!
*Ask Lohse if she&apos;d like to join you. Admit you&apos;ve been hoping for a moment you might be alone together.*
Generate
I hear of someone like you lurking about, getting into trouble.
Fane! Good to see you again.
*Eyes closed, the Paladin silently prays.*
*Glower at her as only a skull can. You don&apos;t need to be reminded...*
Please don&apos;t do that. I&apos;d hate to have to kill you.
Many servants, one master.
*Tell them you only found one.*
Ah! Captain, please let this one pass. He&apos;s a loyal disciple of the God King - a clandestine agent working against our enemies. I can vouch for him...
I won&apos;t let anyone hurt my mistress any more.
*Your God flies forth, grasping at Xantezza&apos;s neck, but his hands connect with nothing. He spins, confused and snarling.*
*Remark that Arx has been beset with Voidwoken attacks and infighting between the Magisters and Paladins - he&apos;s wise to have stayed indoors.*
Hidden away somewhere, safe from the storm, I hope.
Hair
I... don&apos;t think so. What you&apos;re asking is the potential to loose a demon. Who knows what damage it might cause.
*Tell her you carry the regards of Lyn and Conway Pryce.*
*Tell Zimski your values are none of his business.*
Did you hear that? Someone&apos;s out there!
This miserable town has too many gossip-mongers... but they&apos;re right - we &lt;i&gt;have &lt;/i&gt;had some desertions of late. Veterans, disgruntled with the new leadership...
It isn&apos;t a matter of gold. It has a personal meaning.
So make no mistake, Ifan: chances are the road to divinity will be paved with dead gods, their blood on your blood-red hands.
*Ask how he intends to combat such a nefarious plan.*
An Eye for an Eye
Nice... I guess. Wonder what makes it useful.
*Cough and ask her to repeat the riddle again.*
It runneth over not.
*Say you can&apos;t imagine anyone better for the job.*
Mortle? I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t know any Mortle. Tell me the truth: Who are you?
Oh. He&lt;i&gt; swears. &lt;/i&gt;Did you hear that, everyone? He &lt;i&gt;swears! &lt;/i&gt;Why, that&apos;s almost as good as a pinkie promise!
*Ifan lies motionless, curled on the ground like an animal. Under his shaggy hair, you can see green eyes fluttering as if in a nightmare. A low whine escapes his lips.*
I... I was forced to.
Yeah. Piss off.
Arhu&apos;s Religious Journal
Reduces the damage from water-based attacks.
This so-called &apos;drink of the gods&apos; smells more like a demon&apos;s jock strap.
I&apos;ll do what you want. Just don&apos;t hurt me...
The Black Ring on the island were looking for a druid.
Portrait of Lulabelle
&lt;i&gt;I can devour the living just the same.&lt;/i&gt;
We destroyed the Soul Jars. The undead can now die.
*Reach towards the sculpture.*
Hah! Removed your collar like a disobedient dog, I see! A very... leafy dog. I&apos;d pity you, but Septa the Ineffable has no patience for weakness.
Why the rush? Isbeil, what is going on here?
*The door stays resolutely closed.*
Physical Armour
We&apos;ll just have to try again another day, won&apos;t we?
You returned to the world as one more dwarf among many.
There&apos;s only one place for someone like you: a prison cell!
*Affirm the queen&apos;s assertion. Ryker had little respect for fallen souls.*
If I were a White, where would I hide something I didn&apos;t want found?
I had no choice. If I had left those souls alive, I&apos;d stand no chance of defeating Adramahlihk. This is the only way forward.
*Tell the spirit you mean no harm.*
And on the integrity of the elven Godwoken who did not ascend.
Glad you didn&apos;t get away with anything. But I don&apos;t want your disgusting hands all up in my business again.
*Show him the tablet. Your quest was a success!*
*Look upwards to the sun. Yes, you feel it. The light spreads through you, as if banishing the shadows of your heart.*
Staff Of Magus
No, we will have the giant march. In time, we&apos;ll see whether it deserves our confidence.
*See the worry in her face and think better of telling the truth. Say you think you&apos;re mistaking him for someone else.*
The friend of our lady Dallis. Tsss, tsss. Shouldn&apos;t have come here little friend.
Are you feeling poorly, Dallis? &lt;i&gt;Good. &lt;/i&gt;You shall &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;seal the Veil. And now... it is time.
*The boy stands back from you, steady eyes grimly surveying the empty water where his boat was tethered.*
Millennia later, adventurers would come in search of the legendary Divine City of Arx
Orc Warrior
*The spirit looks up at you. His eyes bulge in shock just before he disappears.*
One day I&apos;ll know who they were, the ones on my right arm. And one day they&apos;ll all be dead, the ones on my left.
Kemm takes the paladins to the Cathedral and I get left here. That&apos;s a real vote of confidence, that is. Still, it&apos;s my duty to serve and serve I will.
*She resists the enquiry but before the door in her mind closes you gather a single thought - the Princess is likely to have escaped the destruction and can be found with the dreamers. Wherever they are.*
*Tell him you&apos;ve always wanted a family...*
[JESTER] *Wink, and gesture at the teapot. Indeed, overabundance is a sure sign of decline.*

Remember, you may not be about to drown, but there are more dangers than a wet skull. Humans do not take kindly to the defleshed.
