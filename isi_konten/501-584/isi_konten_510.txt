It seems to be the code to a safe. Better hang on to this...
I was a father once. Now, I am so much more.
*Try as he might, Tarquin cannot hide a small flash of surprise.*
*Tell her you didn&apos;t see anything interesting and walk away.*
*Sebille grabs you by the arm, her nails embedding themselves into your flesh.*
I define &apos;great&apos; as more than just &apos;battle-ready&apos;. You carry enough weapons and sundries to burden an overmuscled ox. And no history book touts a single ox&apos;s greatness.
I made a deal with Adramahlihk the demon, and we claimed Divinity between us.
Your wandering hands just bought you time in a prison cell. Come on. Off you go.
*Say that from the sound of it, he suffered from gilded cage syndrome.*
She said she was going to make a scene. She wasn&apos;t kidding.
Yes... I, the god I who created you, tremble!
*Scoff* Whatever. I don&apos;t have the time for tall tales. You&apos;re coming with me.
I should have ran you through with my sword back in Driftwood, not offered you my hand.
I can fill the gaps your own memories cannot.
Where you go, the King follows. What you say, the King hears. You travel the edges of the Void, Godwoken. &lt;b&gt;Kill her,&lt;/b&gt; lest you slip beyond its horizon.
*Tell her you&apos;d like to report a crime. Dwarves stole your gear.*
The Ancient Empire of lizards became one of the pillars of the new Divine Alliance. The houses of War and of Shadows were particularly useful in the fight against the God King.&lt;br&gt;The Empire used the war to expand its territory.
Band of the Pilgrim
Bishop Alexandar is looking rather regal.
But I&apos;m sure a young one like you could easily get your head around it.
Besides. There&apos;s something here my heart, such as it is, is set on.
*You see yourself in the mirror. It&apos;s quite a sight...*
*The figure spins away from you, observes you through narrowed eyes. He springs forward again, faster this time, ready to strike a second blow.*
*Prays...* They pledge their lives, O Lucian. Please return, for of lives we will soon run short.
*Fine. He can go ahead and talk to this Dreamer if he must.*
...where did you hear that, precisely? Never mind... the Aeteran is a children&apos;s fable, nothing more. Supposedly a wand with an infinite capacity for Source. Pure nonsense, I assure you.
*Tell her that more than anything else you long to kiss her.*
Arx
*He nods to a bloody corpse in Magister&apos;s garb lying in the doorway.*
*Tell her that Lord Arhu is missing. Ask if she knows where he might be.*
Bloodmoon Island
*Tell her she&apos;s nothing like her sister with the Seekers.*
Target is out of sight
Alright, alright, fine. I don&apos;t have time for this anyway. Be off with you.
So it is you after all. Demon. Pig. Get out of my sight before I report you to a Magister for... whatever strikes my fancy. No-one here will defend you.
Accuracy: [1][2]&lt;br&gt;
Looks like this place gave the Black Ring a bloody nose... best be careful ahead.
*GROWL!* Maggot-mouthed lapdog... filth-fawning freak...
We&apos;ve got a deal. Don&apos;t make me regret it.
Do hurry. My hooves are shivering from the chill.
The Ascension of Lucian.
*Tell him he&apos;s holding a golden monarch.*
I feel all funny and light! I feel like a &lt;i&gt;cloud!&lt;/i&gt;
And how&apos;s my little spider monkey doing? Safe and sound?
*Shrug. You&apos;ll figure it out.*
*Tell her you see a nice young lady in need of a nice long bath.*
This flesh is capable of thought. It hopes that if we walk free, it shall see the sun again.
There&apos;s no end to them!
Legend says she bore Duna&apos;s child - and it&apos;s her blood that runs through every dwarven royal.
Texture Filtering:
Dallis is something of a scholar, in possession of detailed knowledge of obscure ancient technologies.
Toggle Memory List
Those Whites are hypocrites. Every last one of them.
Now, you&apos;ve joined those pigs... so you&apos;ll share their fate...
*From the rise and fall of his chest, you can tell he is still - barely - alive. But he&apos;s out cold and no amount of shaking will rouse him.*
*You received his invitation. You&apos;re here now. Tell him to talk.*
Human Warmaiden
*The young woman seems about to raise her hand, but quickly remembers herself and nods pointedly at the excited children.*
City Ranger
*She suddenly stops short and stares at you, hard.*
Paddy was pullin&apos; a cart. Paddy pulled it r-e-e-e-e-e-a-l good. Slow &apos;n&apos; careful. Careful &apos;n&apos; slow. Paddy carried the good stuff, on account &apos;a Paddy was real good at it.
There&apos;s bodies in the streets - this place isn&apos;t free, not anymore.
The stark white gloves of a stark White Magister.
...and flush with gold, they&apos;ll lord o&apos;er the meek.
She is not a figment, my lord. She is fact.
After all I had to do to free myself of the God King, you &lt;i&gt;just gave into him?&lt;/i&gt; You&apos;ve ruined everything, I want you to know that. Now get out of my sight.
*Ask why she seems so moved over a simple arena match.*
I believe the phrase is: caught red-handed.&lt;br&gt;
Oh beautiful - thank you. My death waits...
*Your touch creates a ripple across the mosaic, as if it were water and not stone. A comforting warmth spreads through you, starting at your fingertips.*
Kiss Of Death
*Express your sympathies for the loss of her brother-at-arms.*
Range
And also terribly good fun.
A few of them are in good spirits - especially the children. The others are sullen. Don&apos;t blame them... change is rough. But they&apos;ll make new friends sooner or later. And when we cure them for good, they&apos;ll be thanking us, not cursing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, most of them. That elf with the dice, that Lone Wolf, the creaky-voiced woman in the kitchen... some folks won&apos;t get over it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reckon they won&apos;t be first to get cured. If they&apos;re ever cured at all.
Toy Wooden Block
ENOUGH. D&apos;y&apos;know they killed Anhar? Do ya? Start talking sense, or I&apos;ll take that tongue right outta your mouth and fry it for supper.
Phase B Volatility
*He looks at you a long moment. Suddenly, his blank, scarred face cracks into a mask of madness, his eyes bulging, his mouth open in a wide snarl baring blackened teeth. He bellows:*
*The figure stares at you intensely. Under her hot gaze, your guise feels intolerable against your skin.*
*Look at it more closely.*
A medium-sized, thick, and cloudy drink that sharpens the Finesse of the drinker.
*Tell him it&apos;s believed that Source attracts Voidwoken, but that all the races use Source.*
And what kind of Divine was Marcus Miles, the Beast o&apos; the Sea, as the world battled on?
*Tell her there&apos;s a lot about you she doesn&apos;t know. She&apos;ll have to earn your secrets.*
*Continue keeping silent and observing.*
Did you really kill that Voidwoken?! Just a moment... let me unlock the door...
*He glances across the room, where his betrothed is pouring herself another goblet of wine.*
Grog the Troll
*Refuse her offer.*
*The moment you touch the door, your belly goes hollow and your skin goes pale.*
*Agree enthusiastically.*
He&apos;s been lost without Lucian. He just needs a divine light to lead the way. And I think he might have found one.
Exactly. I did not suffer the boredom of some spoiled brat: mine was the absolute absence of challenge - the longing not simply to watch the horizon, but to journey towards it.
Thanks to you, there&apos;s still something here to tend to!
Sometimes it&apos;s best to let sleeping questions lie...
If you&apos;re here for the wedding, there&apos;s been... there was... ahem. There&apos;s been a tragedy. Bride&apos;s completely broken about it, poor thing. You better be on your way.
Distinctive Boletus
*She chuckles.*
Yes. I rather liked that. I was trying to kill someone. But she wasn&apos;t there.
&lt;i&gt;there are no friends there are those who serve the king and those who work against him you serve and die if you serve well you rise again&lt;/i&gt;
*Commend him for his faith.*
*Staring down into his face, you realise you are staring into mutilation. He has no eyes, his empty sockets crawling with blood maggots. The gurgling sound comes from his stitched mouth, though no meaning can be understood.*
*The figurehead continues its vigil over the seas. The detail is remarkable - it looks like it could turn around and incinerate you at any moment...*
Come here, stranger.
We left Reaper&apos;s Coast and dealt with the salamander no further.
Ancient Pedestal
&apos;God&apos; is but a word. A god&apos;s worth is defined by power.
Bah, who knows - fled probably. One of &apos;em ordered that we fight to the last man and set this place alight rather than let the Paladins take it...
*Object. You only took what you had to.*
Hit_Melee_Crit_3
You need a bath.
Abandon love, and turn to worthy quests...
*Another dwarf puppet. Turn away and look for its master.*
We&apos;ve already had our little chat.
I&apos;d tell ya to take care crossin&apos; the Divine Order, but from what I hear, you can handle yourself just fine &apos;gainst Alexandar&apos;s flunkies.
It was more than easy to succumb to his gilded lies. I regret it. But I know that you can rise up and rip away his grip on our world. You can still free Rivellon, love. You can still free &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;
You have the Council&apos;s location? Blessed news! Quickly, you must tell Malady. Hurry, go!
Scoundrel skills are skills for rogues and thieves. High Finesse improves these skills.
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;. The so-called &apos;friend of Dallis&apos;. I&apos;d be wining and dining aboard the Lord Dread if it weren&apos;t for you. Your meddling in Magister affairs had better be worth it!
That, I&apos;m afraid, is a matter of perspective. From where &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; stand, all of you must die. &lt;i&gt;Everything &lt;/i&gt;depends on it.
The Sallow Man is dead? How... fortuitous! Your courage has brought us one step closer to closing off the Void for good!
Give us a smile! We may be here, but at least we&apos;re alive! And ain&apos;t the sun rather fine on yer face, to boot?
You. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;are to be my champion? How I wasted my efforts saving you as that ship went down.
*Nod quietly. That wasn&apos;t quite what you&apos;d predicted. You&apos;re not sure how to feel about it.*
You&apos;re still here being mean and stupid, I see. No offence, etc.
Well-used Magister Crossbow
What the hell are you waiting for?! GO!
Very Silent Watcher&apos;s Leather Shirt
THE SECRET OF THE GODS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have seen them with my own eyes. And I have discovered the truth. The Seven are keeping a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While we worship them as saviours, they feed on us like cattle. It is all of our Source that keeps them alive. They consume the very lifeblood of individuals, families, villages, kingdoms - all so that they may live on in perpetuity. All so we cannot be sated by the Source we should rightfully keep for ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gods are thieves, and we their victims. The Gods are liars, and we ignorant sheep. The Gods are masters, and we their slaves. When you champion a God, you are championing no less than your own weakness. When you worship, you sentence your neighbours to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will only ever be free when we abandon them as they have abandoned us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L
Lizard mystics have been known to use these shells as musical instruments in their death rituals, invoking the haunting howl of far-sea storms.
Yes, thank you for coming. Indeed it would have been a beautiful ceremony, if only... Dark times. Dark times indeed.
Oh-ho-ho no you don&apos;t. Get out of here. Go on. OUT!
Find the burning chest.
*Loping up behind you, Ifan leans in to whisper in your ear.*
Silencing Stare
*Chuckle and ask if he&apos;s planning a quick getaway.*
And I like it.
