It&apos;s funny, isn&apos;t it. From here, none of it seems real. Dallis. The &lt;i&gt;gods. &lt;/i&gt;I mean *giggle* WE KILLED A GOD!
Ellis Crossley
Big Hands
*No. We must go. At once!*
Then Master Arhu died. So that was sad. I loved Master Arhu. *Sigh.*
*Sob*
Must be one strong forcefield keeping it inside.
The Blackpits
*A saltwater crocodile looks around, seemingly disoriented. It spots you.*
My master&apos;s a good master! He doesn&apos;t do anything nasty to me at all! You be nice about my master or I&apos;ll bite you! *Growl.*
*Rest your hand on his shoulder. He mustn&apos;t blame Jonathan for the Order&apos;s every sin.*
You look lost. Also stupid and mean. And you look kinda... dangerous... so I immediately wish I hadn&apos;t just called you stupid and mean. Don&apos;t hurt me, I can&apos;t help myself!
A murderous demon emerged from the Tyrant&apos;s Helm.
*Tell him you like to... air... your grievances.*
*Tell her you&apos;d love to help but you&apos;re all out of Source keys...*

The more your skull clacks, the less sense you make, Rask. Use your sight - she&apos;s &lt;i&gt;drenched &lt;/i&gt;in Source.
Yes?&lt;br&gt;
Hmm. Can&apos;t find what I&apos;m looking for, but it still looks like you are getting into trouble. You need to cool off in prison!
Braccus Rex discovered a way; this he researched here, upon this isle. He could remove the Source from any creature or individual. I saw the staffs he used myself. They were most impressive.
A warm and homely amulet that glints the colour of ripe pumpkins in the sun.
*You can guess at her emotional state by her nails. Tell her to step back. You&apos;ll handle this.*
Take my advice and don&apos;t say another &lt;i&gt;word, &lt;/i&gt;hear me? Sourcerers brought this plague down on us - them and the sort of folk who see fit to help them.
The mysterious voices spoke to each of us once again. They spoke of water, and purification, before vanishing.
Her Majesty&apos;s business, brother. Ain&apos;t nothing for you to worry about.
Magister Telyn
I came all this way to Arx to worship Lucian, and now I find that his own order have forgotten his teachings... this isn&apos;t right.
*She tilts her head, resisting your intrusion - no sooner do you catch hold of a memory than she snatches it back again. Voidwoken attacking. A rush to protect &apos;the dreamers&apos;. A death as the dreamers escape.*
It&apos;s amazing, really - the lies we tell ourselves. The lies we tell others.
*You&apos;re not eating anything&apos;s heart! Demand he tell you another way.*
*Tell her you&apos;re just passing by.*
*Grunt and walk away. Bloody coward...*
*Comply with the creature&apos;s demand.*
Enemies too fast for you? Combining this fine arrowhead with an arrow shaft will ensure that you won&apos;t be slow on the draw.
Come. Face me. Wriggle into the light, worm.
You have come. My prince. My chosen. It is not too late. Not yet. But almost!
*Inform her of Hannag&apos;s fate. She no longer lives.*
[HERO] *You should have known there was some darkness in that helm! Draw your sword and attack.*
*Say it happened the way it happens to everyone - they heard you were a Sourcerer and hauled you off.*
We have entered a vault that lies beneath a blazing sculpture. Now to see what it conceals.
You are late. Your comrade already attempts to earn their place.
Could be we could find use of the likes of you on deck. Might be good for pushing a swab around.
&apos;I remember when I was a kid, we made water balloons from intestines!&apos;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeuch.
Now - teleport me to that great mossy stone, across the ravine. From there we can sneak by the guards without too much fuss...
You one of them? A Divine Order loyal? They killed a Sourcerer, you know. They&apos;ll hide the evidence well enough, but make no mistake.
*But then, from your core of cores you can feel an unparalleled strength arise. You&apos;re Godwoken, and you resist.*
*Ask the dwarves what they&apos;re doing here. Did they kill these people?*
Good... good. Let&apos;s find out what makes Adramahlihk tick.
You - I need to speak to Lohse. Now. Where is she?
I was slain... but now I have been avenged, and restored... I can rest...
Hotbar Assignment
Bah, just another cowardly dwarf. The only one I want to fight is whoever&apos;s responsible for the disappearances of my Magister comrades in this town...
They say it&apos;s the Voidwoken - that he&apos;s too worried about Rivellon to worry about people.
Safeguard yourself and your loved ones - join us in the Endless Prayer!
Can&apos;t say it wouldn&apos;t have felt good to wring the life from his neck with my own bare hands.
That said I&apos;ll not deny I very much aspire to the surreal. No greater emperor than the one that sits on the throne of gods.
You&apos;re dead to me, thief. Mother, tell him he&apos;s dead to me.
At the start of each turn in combat, spawns an Erratic Entity at a random player location. The Erratic Entity explodes after 2 turns.
No painting could ever capture Tiriara&apos;s radiance.
*...and brightens.*
*Say that you&apos;re on a mission from the Gods.*
Of course you don&apos;t. That would have been far too sensible.
Off to the herd, little sheep. Away you go!
*Take him.*
Our gratitude, stranger. Thanks to your very letter, Lord Kemm mobilised our troops and took command of Arx.
Enter a message...
...if I bet against him, I could win big... or lose it all...
Well I wasn&apos;t feelin&apos; so welcome &apos;til now. You almost had me dancin&apos;!
But beware, they are found in a distant treasure vault, guarded by traps of a cunning not seen by your babe&apos;s eyes, and-
Domestic - Any
I take my things back. But I do not just let this go.
I don&apos;t see why we should change our minds now. Once Black Ring, &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; Black Ring.
Oh, what a grand idea! I&apos;ll try that. What&apos;s the worst that could happen?
Then get yow to it. &lt;i&gt;Now!&lt;/i&gt;
Static Cloud Arrowhead
I intend to spend the remainder of my days seeking to undo what has been done.
[HERO] *Puff out your chest. Surely he wouldn&apos;t demand payment from a hero as renowned as yourself!*
Spirit of Qanna
*You look out to the endless beyond. The sun&apos;s light plays upon the waves, but you know it is not to last. The sails flutter in the wind, yet you know they are soon to still...*
*His face turns dark. He glowers at you...*
Can Backstab
This was a most difficult case indeed. The demon who had attached itself to this particular soul fed on pain. There was no amount of suffering the individual could endure that did not cause the demon the greatest joy. In the end it was safer and more humane to commit both the soul - and the demon - to the vaults.
Number Eight
*The dwarf gives you a long, cold look.*
Sharp as the justice of the gods, Alexandar&apos;s staff must have crushed the skull of many an unrepentant sinner.
Teleport without breaking sneaking.
Of course the lady Dallis has been to the Cathedral before, but I confess it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve seen her.
The time my other ex Roost made me camp out in the forest for days. &lt;i&gt;Days!&lt;/i&gt;
The Godwoken are being hunted. Who wants us dead?
and a 25-pound halibut.
BRUUU!
*Note that he seems quite confident of success.*
Ow! That hurt, you &apos;ig &apos;leeding &apos;astard! &apos;ut if you&apos;ve gotten it outta your system now, then fine. Why&apos;ntcha o&apos;en da chest?
*Micheil bites his lip in an effort to keep it from flapping further.*
*Ask her if she has anything interesting for sale.*
He saved us from the swamps, and then went to find the weapons we need to take down them Shriekers. He said neither the Reds nor the dead would stop him.
Tormented Soul
*The unfamiliar dwarf scratches his head nervously, then chuckles again. He doesn&apos;t seem sure what to say next.*
Attribute points
Why would you cause such a one to wait? You &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; go to her.

*Suddenly noticing your arrival, the Magister frowns and reddens. He steps back and takes hold of his weapon.*

Gettin&apos; the job done where I couldn&apos;t.
&lt;i&gt;then serve the king and serve him well kill the divine pigs and kill the godwoken kill them all feed the king their souls and we shall rise together and we shall live forever&lt;/i&gt;
Find Bahara.
*The skeleton laughs, its ribs shaking and clacking.*
Yet I see potential in you. You have... a reason to fight. You could go far.

Magical Enclosed Helmet
It&apos;s &lt;i&gt;elsewhere&lt;/i&gt; you&apos;ll be going.
Great Axe
His end-all, will be your be-all, for you are Lohse, not Adramahlihk. You are Lohse.
*You feel your God stirring within you. Ask it to intervene, just this once...*
Well? Anything to report?
*The image flickers and fades to a hazy sheen once more, and the sensation vanishes.*
Return to the spirit of Vilnx Creeva.
Spectacular work back there, Lohse. I believe you&apos;ll come out of this on top, after all. I won&apos;t pretend I&apos;m not &lt;i&gt;exceedingly &lt;/i&gt;glad. *Winks*
We consumed Vilnx Creeva&apos;s Source. He complains no more.

*She scowls at you, eyes laden with scorn.*
As Gwydian died while we tried to rescue him, we should be cautious when mentioning his fate to Hannag.
Attack toys, you say? Any other day, I wouldn&apos;t believe you. Today, nothing can surprise me. What&apos;s next: an army of poison toads? Flying crocodiles? &lt;i&gt;Fire-breathing chickens?&lt;/i&gt;
*A moment of silence passes. And then Windego&apos;s scream splits the air.*
What did I do to deserve that?
Well I&apos;ll be. Soon as I lose this blasted headache, I&apos;m off t&apos;see Lohar. He&apos;ll need t&apos;be on top of this stuff.
Reaper&apos;s Bluffs
Didn&apos;t I see you hanging around earlier? I warn you - the city today is in peril. She brooks no spectators.
Explore Bloodmoon Island.
I&apos;ve come to collect. I presume you intend to honour our agreement?
Your &apos;child&apos; rotted away in a tomb. Just like you. &lt;i&gt;Father.&lt;/i&gt;
The Blackpits took fire.
*She tips a finger to her temple in salute, then leaves for the Hall of Echoes.*
Being compact&apos;s got its benefits...
We fled the encounter with the lizard courtesan.
*Say you don&apos;t mind them talking... but you want Alexandar kept alive. He could be useful.*
*You try to call out, but all you get is a lungful of water. The hold is filling fast, and the torrent quickly carries you away, dashing you against the hull of the ship.*
*Ask him if he wants to... y&apos;know... go again.*
Current Ambience
Maybe you can remind me what it&apos;s good for.

Bloody cavies. Too big for their boots, as usual. They oughta keep outta our hair if they don&apos;t want to pay for the pleasure.

BACK TO LOBBY
You&apos;re Godwoken, yes? Oh, but it&apos;s always so hard to keep track of the names they give you. First Sourcerer, then Godwoken, all the while dangling another one in front of you: &lt;i&gt;Divine.&lt;/i&gt;
Fine, fine. Do all the gallivantin&apos; you want. But if a hound goes snapping at your heels, I&apos;m looking the other way.
Anhar,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&apos;s a caravan bound for Fort Joy with Sourcerers on board. Free them and hide them in that abandoned house in town - they&apos;ll help us against the Magisters when we need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I can trust you, son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lohar&lt;/i&gt;
I sense your presence, so very far; so very near.
*Tell the figure this has gone on long enough. Demand that it identify itself.*
My brother&apos;s been sent to Fort Joy, see.
You pick the wrong fight!
Everything Dallis did - it was all you? Child?
