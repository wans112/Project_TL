O&apos;er globes they glide, o&apos;er flats and sharps. Whither go they, lord of life? Direct them!
This is nothing to do with the Paladins - go and tell your Grandmaster that.
*He spasms suddenly.*
You may have noticed incredible things happening on your journey - water beneath your feet aiding you, for instance. It was I who channelled that power within you. You are the source; I am the catalyst.
Is it true? You&apos;re like me?
*Draw your weapon.*
I don&apos;t reward cravens and liars - now get out of here!
*Ask why elves get a different stew to everyone else.*
We executed the Queen&apos;s plan and released the Deathfog on Arx. The sacrifice of thousands now may save millions.
*The carving is covered in Eternal glyphs. They surround a gently-glowing stone that makes you think of the night sky rolled into a ball.*
[MYSTIC] *When she speaks of death, a strange feeling comes over you. Ask what she meant by that...*
Nothing smells better than a new book: fine parchment, dark ink, and the distinctive earthy tang of cured leather.
And to think we prayed together...
It&apos;s a mercy I don&apos;t have a nose. I cannot imagine how you stand it.
Gawking at the dead like they&apos;re nothing more than a sack of cloth and flesh to be looted. Bloody parasi-
Experience
It&apos;s like this: some people, when they get a taste of somethin&apos; delicious, want more &apos;n&apos; more of it. Like fried sea bass. Once you start, you can&apos;t stop slurpin&apos;.
*ZZZZZ!*
Go now, Ifan. Rivellon and its Masters await.
*He knows nothing. You&apos;ll take it up with the cook.*
*Refuse to take orders from a box.*
Nothing here. Now do me a favour, and don&apos;t stick your hands in other people&apos;s pockets.
They shall sing your name, I&apos;ll make sure of it.
My body is CAW-CAW-&lt;i&gt;COLD!&lt;/i&gt; I may be dead, yes, I MAY be dead, but I still c-c-c-care. Are my babies safe and sound?
Ryker lives well, it seems. Pity the location&apos;s so... undesirable.
The wound&apos;s closed over... thank you.
Casa de Jiji Sparkling Wine
Fine, fine. But keep out of trouble.
*Her hands move again to her throat. She seems to try to make space between her neck and the collar, but there&apos;s no space to be made.*
Mending
The Lady Vengeance seems to be empty...
*Nod. It will be done.*
*Ask why the Seven are hiding out within the other Godwoken.*
Through weakness or malevolence or both, Justinia betrayed her people. Under her, the Kingdom suffered. The dwarves need new leadership.
You speak the spell with brash ferocity, like I knew you would, my champion.
Curse the target to explode after one turn or on death, dealing [1] in 3m radius.
[SOLDIER] *Tell him that the Paladin was just following orders.*
Magister Ranger
Off you go, then. Just stay out of trouble.
I sense our enemies have woven a perilous web here.
Very good. There is little time to waste.
What&apos;ll it be? A bow? A few feet of sharp steel? Something to bludgeon with, maybe?
You here alone, Sir Prince?
Isn&apos;t it... odd, though? Being a god?
*Touch the trophy.*
Target is too far!
Ngh...
I don&apos;t think you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; understand. This blood, his blood. It&apos;s on your hands. And on &lt;i&gt;mine...&lt;/i&gt;
Really? &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; is the hill you want to die on? Happy to oblige...
*Sigh* It will be a long, long life...
Broken Source Collar
The simple truth of the matter is that, yes, we lizards were dragons once. The mightiest creatures to rule sky, earth and sea. But such was the jealousy of our power that all other races united against us and brought us to the brink of extinction.
*Embellish the truth: say it was perfection itself.*
The Sallow Man
I suppose given all that we&apos;ve been through, &apos;friends&apos; would also appropriate nomenclature.
After Fort Joy, Magister Delorus joined the Order&apos;s expedition to the Nameless Isle. Now he&apos;s lost and alone.
Thief. &lt;i&gt;Liar&lt;/i&gt;. You belong in prison.
Hrmm, perhaps you utter some truth. Surely his ear could not be eternally cocked...
[BEAST] *Think for a moment, passing a braided tendril of beard through your hands. Tell her you&apos;re out for justice. No more, no less.*
Poison Resistance
So Godwoken are powerful, huh? Powerful enough to control minds? To force brothers to draw steel against each other?
Now, don&apos;t be shy. Tell me, how can I help you?
*The troll crosses his arms across his chest and shakes his head.*
*A glint appears in her eye, and she smiles. Then she raises her hands and shows you... her rings.*
Makeshift Bow
[1] heals you whenever you deal damage directly to Vitality.
Alexandar. My son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have come. You have fulfilled your potential, as I knew you would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alas, you will not find what you seek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&apos;t doubt you feel abandoned, as I did. I led you here so you might prove your worth, your strength - so you could see you have earned the right to be called Godwoken. Yet you cannot yet claim the mantle of Divinity. That is because Divinity is still locked within my remains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there it must stay, so that we can be free of the Gods&apos; tyranny. For they do not mean to guide you, my son, but to use you. And as long as the Gods exists, our suffering will never end and the Void will forever encroach. Only without the Gods can we be free. Only without them can there be peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without Divinity, they will fade, one by one. Until the day comes when you can return their Source to a deserving world, you must resist the Void with all you can muster. You may think your voyage here pointless now. But that isn&apos;t true. Your voyage here gave you the iron will required to face what&apos;s yet to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stand fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your father,&lt;br&gt;Lucian

So if you want to harass somebody, hang on. Hannag, the original creator should arrive here from Paradise Downs any day now.

These hills reek of corruption. We should watch our step.
I had orders from Queen Justinia. Can&apos;t really say more than that to you.
Now, now. Not so hasty.
Water Resistance
*Tarquin turns away, but you still hear his irritated mutters.*
And when I think of what it made me do? It&apos;s enough to make me want to &lt;i&gt;flay&lt;/i&gt; whoever sings it!
There&apos;s someone here. He seems to be... in great pain.
*Release his hand and ask something else.*

When I grow up, I want to be a hero like you. You&apos;re a &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;hero, not only one from a story. You finished your quest and saved the princess! Skeleton! Friend!
Poisoned Dwarven Stew
You&apos;ve done right by me once. Now it&apos;s time to do right by the queen.
A short, sharp shock of something magical will untangle the wool in my head. And I&apos;ll be free to lie all I want!

It&apos;s already mad as a bag of cats down there, and I&apos;ve no intention of flinging another mangy yowler in there. &lt;i&gt;Scoot.&lt;/i&gt;
*Tell her you stand in awe of her. It has been an honour.*
Dallis the Hammer, the secret Eternal, purged the Godwoken and used the Source to close the veil to the Void. The world was saved. Statues in memory of the Godwoken who sacrificed their Source were erected all across Rivellon. They would never be forgotten.
Just... get out of here, you freak.

Listen, Beast. You have to listen to me.
Can you not listen? I told you: that&apos;s not yours, so get your hands off.

*She starts to speak, but chokes back a sob instead.*
Ending turn...
*Dizziness. It lasts just a moment - but long enough for you to feel Rhalic&apos;s presence. You hear no words, yet understand: it&apos;s imperative you accept Ryker&apos;s bargain.*
A new Divine shall rise...
We fought in the arena and won.
*Ifan told you the password to get in. Whisper it: &lt;i&gt;&apos;Open Minds and Closed Fists.&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
If you wish for vengeance, then turn your rage on that Black Ring &lt;i&gt;witch. &lt;/i&gt;Come!

The Voidwoken told us that Murga is a coward - she uses invisibility to win her battles.

[FANE] *Snap that your bones have experienced more than his whole species, and you&apos;ll swat him like a fly if he doesn&apos;t let you pass.*
No more gods, no God King, no Voidwoken. Dallis&apos; persecuted Sourcerers were sacrificed to weaken the Seven.
But now... I see that everything&apos;s connected. And I see that everything is unique, too. Marked, in its own way, for greatness.
Ben-Mezd. Really. I&apos;ve never regretted &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;.
*She mumbles to herself. Something about &apos;elitist elves&apos;.*
*But you don&apos;t try to kill him. Instead you sink to your knees. You don&apos;t want to hurt him. You love him. You want his approval.*

*State that you&apos;ve heard he might help you... unlock your potential.*
Well, he runs this place and everyone in it - including you. Better to make yourself useful to him if you&apos;re stuck here anyway. That&apos;s what I did.
Please, step carefully, child. Trust neither king nor pauper - baker nor warrior - traveller nor friend.
*Tell him his wedding cake - the Doctor&apos;s gift - was filled with clockwork toys. They attacked you!*
I... I believe you.
Squeakie squeakie!
*Gently squeeze her hand.*
No word of battle? No word of our Magister brothers and sisters? What can you tell us from the road?
Just a little while longer. Just one more name to take.
Enraged
They say the Lizard Mystics use every part of every animal they kill; perhaps you can find some use for this rather horrible clump of hair.
Let&apos;s go, chief.
[LIZARD] *Chant a song of lizard victory; perhaps the statue will acknowledge you.*
Amadia. The lords. How - how can this be?
Free Spirit
This is when having access to a Godwoken might come in handy. You see, beyond the gates there&apos;s something that my heart, such as it is, is set on.
Are you mad? I&apos;ll cut you down to size.
Ring of the Faithful

We tried to consume Karon&apos;s Source. He weakened a little. Something here really isn&apos;t right.
This is no ordinary fire - water has no effect. Better to just contain it until it dies down.
Do you know what&apos;s interesting? Watching an entire world be strangled by the roots of doom! Seeing the giant races fall like leaves in frost! Hearing the screams of-

Ah, of course. Too important to feel important. Very good.
