He has his own bedroom, does Kemm - and it&apos;s always locked. He&apos;s got secrets, y&apos;see. Trapdoors and ladders - where they lead, I don&apos;t know. But his wife knows nothing about them.
And I remember saying I&apos;d probably never tell you...
*Smile and ask if he&apos;s thinking of taking a holiday?*
Poor slave girl. Master never gave you an education, did he? Let me explain: In the real world, treasure doesn&apos;t simply appear from on high.
