The fight challenges you, but you do not give in. You do not give up. I... I am happy to see this. You are capable of much.
Once I&apos;ve come to a conclusion, I promise you&apos;ll be the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; to know.
Destructive Broadsword
Battle the cake-borne constructs.
Ha! Did you &lt;i&gt;fail,&lt;/i&gt; Merc?
*The sword slides smoothly free.*
*Ask for some.*
*The Magister turns to you with a scowl. He already seemed immensely displeased, and your interjection isn&apos;t improving his mood...*
Syncing with Steam...
One must employ drastic measures when one flees from the God King!
*Tell the door your password seems to have been changed. Ask for the new one.*
You were warned - now you will burn... GUARDS!
*Grin. Dismantling him will be good practice - unless he can tell you where to find the captain.*
He must have known something - he can&apos;t have just been that short-sighted.
A lich is gorging on children&apos;s corpses in Cloisterwood.

*She looks hurt. Downtrodden. She steps forward and gently lays her claw against the bone of your cheek.*
Packed full of vegetables and poisoned broth, this meal is typically served by Elves who just can&apos;t stand each other a minute longer.
[IFAN] *Tell him it should by rights have ended long ago, so you take each day fresh as it comes.*
*He pouts.*
[Finesse Persuasion]
*Tell him this spell doesn&apos;t sit well with you at all. It is a force of destruction, not creation.*
The bell has stopped! I&apos;ll set sail one more time...
Destruction Toggle
*He stares at the fish and meows a mixture of pleasure and pain.*
I&apos;ve come this far looking for a way to be myself. I couldn&apos;t let him scar me so badly that even when he&apos;s gone, I&apos;m still... &lt;i&gt;wrong &lt;/i&gt;inside.
Can you offer a Lucian&apos;s Day discount?
Good sir, you have set my body free. Free to crumble to dust, at last. But my spirit - blast! I remain trapped in this mouldering skeleton yet!
Eternal Rune
That you have faith in Tir-Cendelius surprises me. I suspect you mock me. I do not have time for trifles.
Y-you saved me! Now I can do my duty, when the time comes.
Best get to it, Godwoken! And remember what is at stake here. Do &lt;i&gt;whatever &lt;/i&gt;it takes.
Right now, I&apos;m sending my fluffy friends to mobilise Paladins to readiness. War is... &lt;i&gt;imminent&lt;/i&gt;.
*Duna? Seven lords? Is she talking about the Gods?*
Ouch. It&apos;s red hot!
I... I see...
[LIZARD] *Step forward to speak up for your kinsman.*
You feel it, don&apos;t you? The ship is breathing. It&apos;s awake! We&apos;re almost there; almost safe at last...
*SqueakSqueakSqueak*
Club
I think the damned thing&apos;s closed for good.
I belong to the God King... &lt;i&gt;I belong to the -&lt;/i&gt;
*She shakes her head apologetically.*
*Admit that you may have been mistaken, and take your leave.*
[OUTLAW] *Say that she&apos;s lucky you&apos;re in a forgiving mood.*
*Tell them you killed the Burned Eye Man, his body&apos;s on the beach. &lt;i&gt;There&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;their food...*
Peep, p-peep!
They cannot reach us here, my own sweet darling. Here you are safe.
Milady, please.
*Beg the Paladin for her life - she made a mistake.*
Source Scoundrel Skillbook
My angel, come down from on high to brighten up this cave. What can I do for you?
*Tell him you&apos;ve been tasked with killing Alexandar.*
*Ask him who Lohar might be.*

[SOLDIER] *Maintaining composure, ask what she intends to do with the infernal device.*
I&apos;ll be damned if I&apos;ll get back on that infernal device.
Need supplies? Be quick about it, little wolf. My &lt;i&gt;errands&lt;/i&gt; are more important than trade.
&lt;i&gt;The Seven&apos;s lust for power let in the Void. Our goal is to close the hole they created. To restore the Source to the Veil.&lt;/i&gt;
*A woman&apos;s spirit stands before you in fine robes. Her hands grasp at something that&apos;s no longer there.*
How&apos;d you get in here?
*Squeeze his hand and say that you trust him too.*
I&apos;ll be fine. I&apos;ll be &lt;i&gt;fine&lt;/i&gt;.
*His eyes widen in panic - and then he realises; this is his end. He welcomes it.*
Lord Deathhawk
I couldn&apos;t have done any of it without you, Mals.
I tell you again: that is not yours!
I&apos;m in a poor position to keep tabs on the living. All I know is that Dallis arrived in the city, with a sizeable retinue of my White Magister brethren accompanying her.
Magic Shell
Keep your hands off our stuff.
The last demon you summoned, for power&apos;s sake and for lust&apos;s sake: she was indebted to those who seek your demise. Of this we had no knowledge.
The Warrior was lost, and night approached. To be alone in the darkness of these haunted woods meant certain death, but there was nowhere to turn for shelter. Nearly resigned to fate, the Warrior&apos;s eye caught something... a distant light through the trees.  The Warrior approached, and bit by bit the gentle glow became a campfire. A wizard sat nearby, holding his thin hands to the small flame. Approaching cautiously, the Warrior asked for shelter, and the wizard was happy to oblige.  The two became both friends and tutors, and after many months side by side, the Warrior had learned several of the wizard&apos;s finest spells.  As they travelled, they happened upon a cave from which a terrible groaning echoed. The Warrior went in first, inching along the cold cave wall as the groaning grew louder. Deep within, a figure, half-woman and half-demon, writhed upon the floor. A Sourcerer possessed.  The Warrior turned to escape, but it was too late- the Sourcerer screeched and cast a deadly spell.  Before it could find its target, though, the wizard threw himself in its path. The Warrior turned toward the retching Sourcerer and quickly stunned her. Subdued by the magic, she lay still as a corpse. The Warrior raised his sword and finished the job.
I wish we could have saved him, but I&apos;m glad we freed his soul. He&apos;ll be at peace, now.
And I give you the assurance of disappointment.
*The spirit hangs his head.*
Carolan Fluffinster
*She eyes you curiously, eyes narrowing in her hard face.*
UI End Turn
*The snake returns with a satisfied hiss, but as it slithers back you feel a cold, heavy thump on your shoulder. You look up into the fierce red eyes of the raven.*
*He turns to you and frowns.*
Watch out for Murga, stranger; she&apos;s a formidable fighter, our dear arena champion... and not one to suffer fools lightly...
Our losses are many and painful. And so we fight, that our victory may be great and joyous.
Something about this severed leg doesn&apos;t feel right. Not like all those other severed legs...
Dagger attack that deals [1] and sets Decay and Diseased.
Can something that&apos;s been so dead so long make me feel so &lt;i&gt;alive?&lt;/i&gt;
No, we are the only hope to save this world. You and I alone. But we must hurry. The Void is close. It is so close...
Inspect the cake.
In return for a reasonable donation, that is... ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
*Look around you and frown. Gareth and his group can&apos;t hide here forever.*
*She thinks for a moment.*
The Void did &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;to the Gods? What chance do the likes of us have...?
*Probe for more information on how the ship can be controlled.*
Crafted in bulk for the troops, Magister Trippel&apos;s sword bears the insignia of the Divine Order stamped into the hilt.
...she did not answer. I am not ashamed to say that I hid. There is untold evil in the world, and it has reached the island. It seeks the Godwoken who would be Divine. I cannot bear it.
Let&apos;s make this easy. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; assume you&apos;ve accepted my mission. &lt;i&gt;You&apos;ll &lt;/i&gt;assume I give it in good faith. Beautiful.
You think me mad?
A Swornbreaker! My prince, and you: my saviour, you never cease to amaze!
My mind? What else, my friend? I&apos;m wondering why. All of this. Source. The Voidwoken. The Divine. Why?
*He grins, sharp teeth glittering in the midday sun.*
*The past sweeps about you until you are lost within it. The discordant symphony reaches its climax.*
*Say that you know Magisters have gone missing lately - is she one of them?*
*Oink squee oink.*
*Finish the job.*
My, my, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; intense, wasn&apos;t it? Truth be told there was nothing really left to teach you, but I felt it would be rude to stop once we got going. You were ever so satisfying though. Please accept this little token of appreciation for your efforts...
*Place your hands on the stones.*
Looks like I find just what I&apos;m looking for. Face the consequences, thief!
Demonic Hatchet
Love Has a Price
*Ahem!* Who&apos;re you. Watch it! These are mine! THESE ARE MINE!
Coffins
*Ask him what the Magisters think of the Arena.*
If you have proof of that, you should speak to Officer Carver immediately. I&apos;m sure he would want to hear it.
*Note he must be a practiced sailor. Ask what the figure means to him.*
Now onwards, Shield! Venture forth post-haste! The Great Acorn waits for no one!
House Exterior - Farm
The Craftmistress&apos; spirit asked us to take her to her place of longing: a workshop in Arx.
We destroyed the pillars that held the catatonic little girl.
Best of luck, Red Prince.
Call it what you want. The point is, we are bound together, forever. The sooner you get used to that, the greater we will become.
*She takes you into her arms, into her heart, into her very being...*
*Turn her down once more.*
*Sweat streams from your pores. The roar of the flames drowns the screams. Syrus Oates begins to burn. He does not scream.*
We heard that our homes are likely gone - Voidwoken. We&apos;d be dead with everyone there if we weren&apos;t forced to meet in secret.
Hmm-mm-MM-mm
Oh good.
You brought this on yourselves!
Better her than me.
*Consume her Source.*
[This volume describes the stories whispered about a lizard princess whose very existence is said to be kept secret by the House of Law. A drunk servant once spoke of her as Sadha, and that her skin is a beautiful bright red. With his head on a spike, the servant quickly sobered up.]
Right. Piss off.
This is the God King&apos;s doing.
Freshly Buried Corpse
I haven&apos;t seen a living soul in all that time. What a strange notion...
I have only one regret: I didn&apos;t get the loot. I DIDN&apos;T GET THE LOOT! First came the creak and then the click. Then came the bang! THEN CAME THE BANG! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&lt;br&gt;
&apos;y friend, that would be &apos;rilliant. Whatcha want &apos;e to do?
House Interior - Shop
[Although the schematics are written in an unfamiliar language, the diagrammes match the workmanship of other Eternal artefacts you have seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea that these automatons were crafted by the Eternals seems likely.]
*Treacherous necromancers! Draw your weapon and defend yourself.*
*The machine sits silent and empty.*
[LIZARD] *Tell him &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;are Zorl-Stissa&apos;s chosen champion. All others are frauds and charlatans.*
Very well, coward. Walk away and let me do my duty.
*Tell her Jahan tried to perform an exorcism, and it failed. Miserably.*
There&apos;s something wrong down there an&apos; it&apos;s still not right.
Arx is in danger, I&apos;m convinced of it. Does the city still stand?
Rest in peace, Rory the rat.
Accept him... accept him... accept him...
A word of warning to you, ben-Mezd, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
Cave - Underground Hall - Exit
Whatever you say, hon.
Take me to the place that consumes my dreams. Then the truth will become clear.
