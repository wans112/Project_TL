Immortality is only permanent, my dear girl, until one day it simply ceases to be.
She loves me!
*He winks - and begins to sing.*
Oh hi.
City Indoors 01
*Pledge to him that you will allow him to ascend when the time comes.*
Magical Pot Helm
*He eyes the collar circling your neck and reaches a hand towards his blade.*
Nice pet. Would be a shame if something... happened to it.
*Looking closer, you notice the statue&apos;s clerical garb, so similar to that worn by the ghostly priests bonded to the isle - an unlikely coincidence.*
[NOBLE] *Tell her you misspoke, but even if you hadn&apos;t, she&apos;s in no position to censor you.*
*The shape of the painting is familiar. Wrack your brain to remember where you&apos;ve seen it before.*
The Scion Sebille betrays us. The Mother mourns. The end of the elves draws near. The Scion must change her mind. The Scion &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;change her mind.
By the Queen&apos;s beard, it looks like you lost a fight with a clawhammer! Reckon you&apos;re in need of something to heal yourself up, ey?
Squee! Squee squeeeeee!
*Rasp*
Hey, lady! It&apos;s a lot nicer here than that stinking boat, huh?
Digging Machine
I didn&apos;t find what I needed, but I sure did find something! Let&apos;s get you to the prison cell you just earned, shall we?
*Reach out to him.*
You are the hope for our new homeland. The promise of our future. The very reason we do not give in to despair.
&apos;West - Kemm Mansion&lt;br&gt;North - Ancient Empire Consulate&lt;br&gt;East - City Gates&apos;
Ah, a &lt;i&gt;new &lt;/i&gt;student!
Shame I had to leave the Stonegarden behind. I feel so at home among the graves.
May I ask you a favour, perhaps?
How very correct you are, spouse of mine! Madame Josephine Gribbles De Peeb refuses to be confused with anyone else!
Those who are sworn to the Covenant can be restored... but failure will not be ignored forever. Tread carefully. Fight with conviction.
She had her accomplice, Vredeman, pose as someone who could train me how to master my Godwoken powers - but it was a lie! They sought to hinder, not help. While I was being occupied by Vredeman, Dallis began taking over the Order.
[FANE] *Say you come from a race so ancient it predates the gods themselves.*
*Refuse to help. This a conflict you&apos;d rather stay away from.*
Create blood surfaces. Set Bleeding on enemies. Douse fire surfaces.
Micheil Ros&apos; new son-in-law Dorian Gall is plotting against him.
It&apos;s a hefty amount, but for a job well done we can stretch to it.
*As you lean in close it lurches forward, its arms thrash against the cage bars as it tries to reach you. Looks like it hasn&apos;t been fed in a &lt;i&gt;very  &lt;/i&gt;long time...*
Light Metal Pants
Gareth went off some which-a-way to see about his *shudders* parents. I suppose he must&apos;ve gotten held up. You could go find him, if you&apos;re so inclined.
*The cat looks uneasy about the fish you gave him, but he&apos;s apparently not&lt;i&gt; too &lt;/i&gt;concerned, given how quickly he munches on it.*
Dead Voidling
*Your heart beats the tempo of the dance your body needs.*
*Ask her how she knows these things.*
[BARBARIAN] *Tell him you like his name.*
Why go back in, you wonder? Well, I met some friends out here in the swamps.
*Tell him there is no mutiny. You almost died at this woman&apos;s hands!*
Target ally enters Cryogenic Stasis. Though incapacitated, they become immune to all damage, and heal over time. Removes Shackles Of Pain.
What do you accomplish with this cruelty? This need not be your path.
*Point towards where you saw the dead bear. Tell the cub you&apos;re sorry, but its mother is over there, and she&apos;s dead.*
Save
I&apos;ll need more roses soon enough. Of course, you won&apos;t provide very good compost... but at least you won&apos;t be around to tell anyone what you found here.
*Tell him it is done. The dragons live once more.*
Someone wants the Scions dead and has paid Lone Wolves to do the job. Millennia of elven culture and power could be lost forever.
The Shield thinks saving its world isn&apos;t something it should be grateful for, Quercus! How can something so large be so small-minded?
Until the elf killed Consul Zara...
[IFAN] *Narrow your eyes. Ask how she knows about your past and senses your future.*
Our people are gone! Lost to a conflict brought on by your stupidity!
Watch your step, hamflesh, or I&apos;ll use my Source powers to flay the pink right off your bones!
The horizon&apos;s clear for now. You gonna get this old girl moving before the Reds come for us?
Travelling between the *wince* realms isn&apos;t easy, you know. It takes something from my soul each time. And as it turns out, I sold what I had left to someone very powerful in order to find out the location of the Nameless Isle.
*Bow your head and offer a silent prayer to Lucian.*
*After all that you have been through, and all that you have done - all that you have &lt;i&gt;become &lt;/i&gt;- the Aeteran lies in front of you. Divinity is yours to take...*
&apos;uch o&apos;liged. Thanks, is what I &apos;ean to say.
Tattered Blueprint
[IFAN] *Smirk. Rhalic&apos;s clearly not going to beat you up again. Not in his current state.*
*Confront her about the attack in the garden.*
Lizard&apos;s War Scythe
*The stone door remains just as it was when you last saw it: rigid and unmovable. Only the rotary dial crowning it can be persuaded to stir.*
[ELF] *Insist that it&apos;s true. An elf would know.*
You know, it feels... right. Suddenly I feel I understand everything that&apos;s happened to us. It all seems... intended.
Fane. The traitor shall be destroyed.
After all this time - I never thought I&apos;d walk our halls again.
*You&apos;re here for that money he owes you. Tell him you won&apos;t take no for an answer.*
*Nod. You&apos;ve heard his words and seen his deeds. You will keep them in mind.*
Fane. The unfaithful. The betrayer.
*Taken quite by surprise, he staggers back, blood dripping down his nostrils.*
I was put on a caravan then... they said they were bringing me to Fort Joy, that I should be honoured become a pet of the Hammer... my restraints must have been loose though...
By the Seven and all the saints, I ne&apos;er dreamed I&apos;d be grateful to be lying cold on the ground.
[1] immediately grants you [2] extra attribute point to spend.
That&apos;s a truth, it is. You oughta talk to Griff. He&apos;d be happy to have a clever sort like you on our side.
*The scribe doesn&apos;t notice you at first - she remains utterly focused on her writing. Finally, she glances up.*
&apos;Do I look good? I stepped in something, do I smell? Did you like the apple I found you?&apos; And what do I say? &apos;You look terrible. You stink. Your apple was rotten.&apos;
Movement Mutator
Spirit of a Civilian
Hopefully you&apos;ll never have to find out.
*Take your leave.*
*Ask if he has any pointers for you.*
Research? Hardly. It&apos;s worthless.
Where&apos;s the oil...
I&apos;m tired of doing what others want me to do. I&apos;m choosing to go a different way now.
It&apos;s you!
I... I&apos;m alive... I&apos;m alive!
*Draw your weapon and take a defensive stance. He must speak; you will protect him from harm.*
&lt;i&gt;Kneel.&lt;/i&gt;
Are you going to be boorish in my presence again? What do you want?
[ELF-FRIEND] *Say that you&apos;re an avowed friend of all elves. It&apos;s only right that you be allowed to pass.*
Excellent. You, my friend, have earned a front-row seat to today&apos;s performance!
Indeed. I&apos;m sure they&apos;re watching us &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;carefully.
Paladins! Take them away. We&apos;ll get to the truth.
*Tell him you understand why he&apos;s upset, and you&apos;re sorry.*
If you go near my master, I&apos;ll kill you! *Growl.*
UI Select Slot7
Argh! Has it turned on us or just lost its mind?
Then I don&apos;t have anything to tell you. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have customers to serve. Customers with money.
*The reaver shoots you a withering look, as much as his wasted features will allow.*
Cakes and pies of boysenberry...
If the missus will go for it, of course. She likes the beach.
I&apos;ve got to get out of here.
Altruistic
We lost a ship sailing Sourcerer prisoners to Fort Joy.
Here is the truth, Ifan. &lt;i&gt;I&apos;m&lt;/i&gt; Lucian&apos;s son. And I will take &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;actions necessary, for the good of all. Nothing can stop me from reaching the Well of Ascension and becoming the next Divine.
*Say that Windego told you he was Black Ring.*
Woollen Shirt

*Ifan clears his throat. Roost turns to face him - and roughly wrenches the elf&apos;s jaw toward  him as well.*
It&apos;s good your little friends are here to support you, Lohse, but you must do this yourself.
Such a gallant goal - but Her Royal Majesty needs no rescuing, I assure you. Now then. We adhere to a certain decorum in this court. You are of noble descent; I am certain you understand.
Broken Angelic Statue
Yes. I imagine you are a conoisseur of killing. You know that he sweetest scents flourish in the deepest tombs. Tell me. Do you like roses?
[IFAN] *Stare impassively at the statue. The gods never helped you when you &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; faith; why bother praying now.*
Tasha
You are sworn. You are bound to the Covenant.
Very well. Approach.
The candles burn on. Malady was furious.
The monitor you want to play the game on when it&apos;s fullscreen or fake fullscreen.
Alright, dwarf. But Magister Atusa is overdue. She promises to come at noon. We are afraid to stay, afraid to leave...
Red Ball
[MYSTIC] *Tell her you&apos;re just someone yearning to see the gods.*
*Gareth shakes his head vigorously in response to his own emotions.*
My entourage is taking good care of her, I promise. Well, as good as you would expect. If she&apos;s missing a few digits or bearing a few new bruises, that&apos;s just... expected wear and tear.
You&apos;re good to go. Nothing out of place, as far as I can tell.
No time for even a little diversion, eh? A pity. Something should light your way on darker days, wouldn&apos;t you say?
*Tell him that as the new Divine you&apos;ll need your friends close. He &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;stand with you.*
I... I&apos;ll need some time to recover from this loss &lt;i&gt;most grave&lt;/i&gt;.
*Loudly tell her she&apos;s wasting arrows.*
*He licks your hand and pauses. Something about you doesn&apos;t taste right... But then he shrugs, barks at his master... and leaves.*
Prince, you know not what you do! To deny me is...
*Ask why Lucian was so determined to prevent anyone reaching his last resting place.*
Belt
Set Split
You are not worthy of the trial. Leave.
You&apos;re wonderful.
Deerskin Gloves
Hey... before we dash off into the wild world yonder, I should mention: Malady and I had a talk on the way here.
That wench? A priestess? She&apos;s no more godly than the mites in my skull.
*Sneer at the brute before you. He wouldn&apos;t have lasted a night in your pack.*
This good red meat - I&apos;ll take it over grubs and potato peelings any day!
Better even to &lt;i&gt;puke &lt;/i&gt;yourself to death than get purged, don&apos;t you think? You should be happy for Griet!
If I were smart, I&apos;d&apos;ve kicked off already. Boss had the right idea.
*She peers at you, trying to figure you out.*
