We met Windego, the murderer from our journey into Fort Joy, now caged by the Magisters. We set her free.
Blessings to our fallen; I pray that they may find rest...
Letter to Linder Kemm
*Ask why he&apos;s still here if his people have vanished.*
You better stop before you hurt yourself. All &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;, but no &lt;i&gt;result&lt;/i&gt;.
One of my late colleagues designed them for the Cathedral - little wind-up sentries to guard against intruders. Now, I busy myself turning the surplus into toys. It truly feels good to spread a little &lt;i&gt;joy &lt;/i&gt;in my twilight years...
[LOHSE] *Twirl and tell him you&apos;ve been sent as entertainment for the troops.*
Do I? I think I belong here... with the rest of them.
&lt;i&gt;Captain&lt;/i&gt;, actually. And that figure tells me we&apos;re getting close to the Joy... close to what lies beyond it, too.
Your master cursed us with life. It would be cruel not to give you the gift of death.
Hopefully Edie moved on in peace.
Let&apos;s have a long-awaited look!
I can still feel the Void emanating from its cage...
I was playing Laslor&apos;s lute when the thing inside smashed it to bits.
The Driftwood Arena
*Attend to the queen. Ros sent you to help; is she hurt?*
I didn&apos;t want any of this.
I&apos;m not, I swear it!
Assassination Contract
Yes, I am Craftmistress Pia Graciella. Your interest can wait - there is work to be done.
Silence a target.
*You move through the absolute black, whipped sore by unseen tendrils. Then suddenly in the distance: a streak of red; as if a gargantuan dragon opens a solitary eye.*
I gave you two chances already, thief!
Falone Girt
Small Crossbow
*The Magister draws her sword.*
Paladins don&apos;t need &apos;em either. They took the weapons off the dead Magisters.
Magister Carruthers
[LOHSE] *Admit you&apos;re disturbed to realise the lengths you will go to in order to be rid of what possesses you. If entire worlds must bleed and die, so be it.*
*An odd-looking young woman is staring intently into the distance, fingers curled rigidly at her sides. Greyish-black veins run from her eyes down her cheeks.*
We told the pig about the shrine; perhaps its prayers will be answered.
Nature provides.
If you want.
No... it isn&apos;t real, it isn&apos;t real... it&apos;s just a nightmare, just a night&lt;i&gt;-yeearrgh!&lt;/i&gt;
*You place the offering deep inside the dragon&apos;s mouth. Something in the dark seizes your wrist.*
Deep down everyone wants to be a good boy. You&apos;re a good boy good boy good boy. If you want to be.
* - and then they are gone.*
My wealth is boundless. So ask, but do not take without permission.
Kana
Dagger attack that deals [1] and sets Bleeding and Terrified on target character.
*Ask her what&apos;s inside the cave behind her.*
*You embrace and at long last you become one - the Red Prince and the Red Princess. A coupling aeons in the making, as world-moving as it is quietly intimate, here in a lone wagon in a lone spot, in Rivellon vast and fair.*
Our survival hinges on getting this ship moving, Godwoken. We&apos;re searching every corner of it for anything that might help us.
Mysterious Reliquary
Who do you think you are?! Harm one of my patients, will you?!
&lt;i&gt;No!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sssssssset ussssssss free. SSSSSSSSET USSSSSSSS FREE.&lt;/i&gt;
Power always comes at a great cost. Sometimes... sometimes you have to take some lives to save others. And I shall always put dwarven lives first. You &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;understand this.
We were lucky not to meet the same end as this lot. We can honour them by avenging them.
Beer Source
*Ask where these jars are located.*
The Shriekers block all escape routes though - we can&apos;t get off this island until we get p-past them...
Mystical Small Flame Rune
We met a dwarf at the centre of the vault - he claimed that Brother Kalvin was being merely superstitious, and that he was not in fact possessed. He desperately wanted us to destroy the pillars that held the chains binding him.
Cup
Your wisdom once again shines through, sweet Fane. These creatures can be more dangerous than they seem.
These images ([1], [2] and [3]) are being synced by other player(s).
*The skeleton resumes his search, leafing through page after page while hunching over the book in a futile attempt to keep it dry.*
*Stagger back.*
Last of the &apos;Eternals&apos;, Fane believes the Blackpits on Reaper&apos;s Coast hold clues to his people&apos;s fate.
Encourage
Well, there are a few, my friend. Got a right-good rebel whooper on hand warnin&apos; of the barbaric Beast! The other&apos;s... well, it ain&apos;t so respectful, but royal guardsfolk on &apos;oliday always ate it up.
Oh?
Spirit of a Little Boy
None of your beeswax. I pay good money, that&apos;s all you need to know.
*Ignore his pained countenance and wax poetic about your conquests.*
They were thorough, I&apos;ll give them that. Even got into the vault, it seems. But everything you need should be safe.
Rancour
Call to Arms
Back again, eh? You in need of something?
Heh-heh-heh... How predictable. Like any good dog.
*Growl!* Stay back, grey-skin!
Dead Bear
*Trembling, he smiles. Closing his eyes, he moves to kiss you too.*
Please, small child. Leave me to my ruminations...
The Mother is in danger. A shadow hunts her. You must rid us of the shadow.
I love you too, baby... I love you too.
I see that Gareth has returned to his flock empty-handed. They&apos;re brave souls, these Seekers. Brave, but foolish if they think they can overcome the Magisters.
Deciding fates.
Why? Because we&apos;re at sea of course, and have been for several days!
*The guard tugs at his collar nervously, and his face takes on a definite crimson hue. He kicks his boots in the dust, desperately trying to look anywhere but at you.*
What&apos;s new, cuckoo?
*Contemplate his words and say you very much like the sound of them.*
Is there more, lizard? Speak up, or hold your scraggy tongue.
If any Seekers survived, we&apos;ll have to deal with them.
W-o-o-o-w, you look cool! I like your hair. I like your eyes. I like your collar. I have one too!
Headwear moulded from dappled, bark-tanned hide. Three words are engraved inside: &apos;Unity is Strength.&apos;
Find a Purging Wand for Exter.
*Your choice is made.*
Speak with the elderly couple.
AI
You&apos;re the one who brought it up...
Changes Incarnate&apos;s element to fire, unlocking Fireball.
She&apos;s just getting her retaliation in first. You can&apos;t say she lacks audacity. Or purpose. Or ruthlessness.
I fear, kin. I fear the Mother Tree is dying. The last Scion betrays.
Magical Elven Menaulion
Welcome, Miss Kaleran. I&apos;m glad you could come. Tell me, what ails you?
You damnable fool! Wretched spirit - you could have brought destruction on us all.
We should talk, yes. But let us unleash Lucian&apos;s fury first.
She&apos;s not the demon we thought her to be. Give her what she wants. Let her have the Swornbreaker.
We consumed Raedalus&apos; Source.
Please. My sister in undeath... release me...
[1] lets you heal from poison, but regular healing will damage you instead. You will receive Poisoned status even if you have Magic Armour.
So go forth into the world with my blessing, dear one. Heed my words and go...
Stinger
Two-Handed Sword
*Allow the candle to reveal itself. Allow its spirit to be seen.*
Disembodied Hand
*Ask him why he doesn&apos;t seem scared.*
*Offer to help.*
Get on with it. I&apos;m sure they&apos;re hiding here somewhere.
*You don&apos;t hear, but &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;a whisper in your ear. It tells you to slip the ring onto your finger...*
What would I do without ya, Prudes.
*You &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt;, but ask if you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to.*
*Beg the dwarves not to attack - you don&apos;t want to hurt them.*
*You&apos;re in no mood. Take your leave.*
Streaked with filth and rust-coloured blood, this severed arm is no longer any good to its previous owner.
*She pauses, one ear cocked, and frowns.*
There you are. Thank goodness. Have you seen those Shriekers keeping watch yonder? We&apos;ll never manage to take the Lady Vengeance while they&apos;re there.
I&apos;m not sure I can blame them for turning to the Void, after being wronged like that. Perhaps they deserve restitution.
Fiery-bright as the sun itself, this wand is almost too hot to the touch.
[1]&apos;s lobby
Level [1]: restores [2]% Armour.
You did it! The portal-master is dead!
You? Why, you&apos;re everything.
The torn pages describe the proper way to interact with Duna&apos;s Undertaker.
*He opens his mouth in a sloppy grin and pokes his tongue through rotten teeth... but his tongue is not a tongue, it&apos;s the head of a snake... its own forked tongue flickers with a puff of black smoke... and it winks at you.*
*The flies sting you and sting you and sting you. After you are almost completely spent, the witch releases you from her grasp and stands back, wiping her mouth.*
You speak only when spoken to. Now, where&apos;s my tea? And it better not be that earthy stuff from lizardland. Even the cats won&apos;t drink that swampwater.
*The hulking brute recoils slightly from you, and gestures towards deeper in the island.*
Bahara
That&apos;s it. I&apos;m finally alone...
The Shadow Prince is dead. Sebille is free.
Today is a dark day. Today is a day of death. But soon... very soon, new light is reborn.
I... have something for you too. A spear. But... curious. It is gone. If you find who takes it - it is yours.
This may strike you as rather eccentric, but the thought of travelling with one such as yourself quite enthuses me.
That divine voice, that glorious visage. You are fair, elf, but Barstan&apos;s allure is unsurpassed. Such a face could only be sculpted by the hands of a god.
Vase Open
A dark figure wanders there. She understands these roses, why they take root.
I&apos;m glad I find in you a friend. My eggs must be protected at all costs. Dragons will hatch from them, a new race entirely!
Snake coiled &apos;round a heap o&apos; guts! Stinking prince of an unwashed sick bin! Garvan! GARVAN!
*Fane is reading a volume of Cranley Huwbert&apos;s famous encyclopedia. He leafs through it slowly, muttering to himself.*
A pure spirit has risen from this profane world. There may be hope yet for sinners seeking redemption.
Telemetry Stop
*Surrender your mind.*
Cursed Blood Infusion
I&apos;ll take that as a &apos;no&apos;.
*Tell the bird that he&apos;s only prolonging his suffering.*
*She seems about to speak, but pauses before turning back to the statue.*
Accept his covenant. Reject this world&apos;s false gods and mortal races. Pledge yourself to your King and join your people once more. Come home, Fane.
What happened...? Are - are we dead, Jules?
May Gareth always choose the right path.
*Say there are some things you&apos;d like to discuss.*
*He scowls and braces himself for a fight.*
*Tell her you know all about the sewers. You know all about Queen Justinia. You know everything.*
*If you had guts they&apos;d be churning. Every act of horror Dallis committed... that was &lt;i&gt;your daughter?!*&lt;/i&gt;
[IFAN] *Say you see a bunch of bad ways to die.*
Well, this is the estate of the - uh - venerable Kemms! We&apos;ve all come to trade with Linder and his missus, but with recent events... let&apos;s just say, they&apos;re busy. But Cat&apos;s inside, &lt;i&gt;she&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; come up with something.
He&apos;s waiting on the beach of Fort Joy.
That story hits a little too close to home. Poor luckless fool...
Knowing that you no longer have power in the world is some comfort. But you deserve not to exist. Even the Halls are too good for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;...
Undeployed Thunderbolt Trap
*Chuckle. What an amusing memory; you&apos;d almost forgotten!*&lt;br&gt;
Unidentified [1]
