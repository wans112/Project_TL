Rise of the Dwarves
Then you count your blessings. If you see one, do not fire an arrow into it, do not run it through with a sword, do not pierce it with a dagger. Just run.
*Beast leaps to his feet and begins to gyrate his hips. He runs his hands up and down his chest and buttocks, blowing you a kiss with each garment he jettisons. When the dance ends, a nude and winking dwarf stands before you.*
Game Master Rolls
*Tell her you&apos;re not here to talk about your private life.*
You&apos;re in my space, stranger. Feel free to leave it.
*Suggest: &apos;You are not taking part in this inane game of his.&apos;*
The spell is a little unusual, I admit. It harnesses the power of those that you&apos;ve slain and lets you use it against those you&apos;ve yet to kill.
*Ask Isbeil how she knows so much about you.*
&apos;Here Be Witchery.&lt;br&gt;Trespass Not.&apos;

You won&apos;t slither away again! My babies will get their lunch...
*The dragonchild inside the egg begins to stir. The egg begins to tremble. The shell begins to crack...*
Oh! Oh dear, I seem to have crossed some cultural taboo. How... difficult.
We met a large and belligerent bridge troll by the name of Grog. He demanded a stupidly expensive bridge toll.
You are cautious. An admirable quality in a Wolf. I, too, have... &lt;i&gt;difficulty&lt;/i&gt; with trust.
Some farmer took me for a bloody &lt;i&gt;rooster&lt;/i&gt;... imbecile. At least I had his brood&apos;s full attention... but they&apos;re dead, and so is he, I&apos;ll wager.
*You slowly embed the Lone Wolf&apos;s name into your skin, sentencing him to death.*
Add grenades
Wrecker&apos;s Cave
Spirit of Hubert Oak
*Greet the pig and introduce yourself.*
Do you feel it, Scion? The Mother is gone. We are free!
*Demand that he tell you what he knows about the Council.*
His words get me, ya know?
Little bones and bloody mush... the perfect soil for blood roses.
Oh, dear child. You are quite formidable, but you have forgotten much of what you once knew.
Rest
Patty Cake, Patty Cake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can try throwing pumpkins into a pot, but you&apos;ll never be able to make pumpkin soup like my gran did! She&apos;d never share her recipe though. I&apos;ll teach you one day, she said.
Flesh and bone, severed and stitched. A rather... sordid brand of necromancy.
We may free the witch or leave her to rot.
*Delorus closes Pearst&apos;s eyes with his palm before getting back on his feet. He looks at you with wounded anger.*
Two heads are better than one. And when push comes to shove, four fists are better than two, right?
It is &lt;i&gt;She!&lt;/i&gt; The woman I&apos;ve dreamt of since birth! The secret of my soul. My sweet lady, it is an honour!
That poison-peddler? A swamp frog is a more potent warrior. Let me show you the power of the King&apos;s true chosen!
*The foul creature greets you with a grotesque parody of a courtly bow in a failed effort to hide the hungry gleam in his eyes.*
I can go now. I can go now. I CAN GO NOW! Heehee!
Ah, it does my heart good to see young ones fed, so it does. Sharing a hearty meal gives twice the joy!
Let&apos;s not tarry! This old tub is about to burst!
*Nod. She&apos;s currently playing host to an entity, right? Something that lives in her head?*
Let&apos;s not intimidate our guest further, Isbeil; I am yet too intrigued to give him leave. Why do you allow this shrouded figure before me?
*Your face and Amadia&apos;s mannerisms? Ask what kind of charming chimera you&apos;re speaking to.*
Accept this gift as a promise. Should you gather the entire set, I will reward you a thousand times over.
One could seek some esoteric meaning within the ripples on the surface of the rainwater, but sometimes it&apos;s best to accept that a bucket of water is just a bucket of water.
Don&apos;t like conversations? This should provide the final answer to any questions.
All mortals are thieves! You have stolen our world. All the world is ours!
*Say that her senses must be failing her after so long in this dark cavern - you are no threat.*
*You cannot stomach watching this beast wolf down its innocent victim. Move in for the kill.*
[NOBLE] *Tell the cub that cream rises to the top.*
Tyrant&apos;s Stride
Cotton Gloves
Ho, pilgrim.
After all, it might be the last thing she ever did.
*Marvel: &lt;i&gt;&apos;How did one of Lucian&apos;s own end up as a Lone Wolf?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Fork
I don&apos;t seek anything so pedestrian as &lt;i&gt;peace&lt;/i&gt;. I seek knowledge...
My my, you have been a busy little creature, haven&apos;t you? Yes, they would do nicely.
Almost sweeter than your teeth can handle, this form of berry pie is commonly eaten by joyous pilgrims on their arrival in Arx for Lucian&apos;s Day.
Time is short, Godwoken - enter the Council.
*Wonder if there&apos;s a point to all this...*
*You press your palm against the door to open it. The wood feels neither cold nor warm, but simply &lt;i&gt;grey&lt;/i&gt;. The crimson drains from your hand, and you are left... numb.*
Dallis must be stopped. A new Divine must ascend. If not, Sebille&apos;s freedom - of all elves - could be short-lived indeed.
*Squint out across the river, looking for the boy&apos;s mother.*
Although I suspect it&apos;s the other way around.
*Spit at her feet and walk away.*
*She steps forward, slowly but confidently. She holds out her hands, palms up. They emit no fire, no ice, no curse.*
Tell me, does this feel right to you?
*Cry out your disapproval. You can&apos;t let them go ahead with this!*
Well then, glad I got the benefit of your experience!
Put me right, my lord. Please, my lord...
*You&apos;re sorry to hear him say that, but you won&apos;t back down. You &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;ascend.*
I&apos;m shocked and surprised... and also rather relieved. This rather throws my own case into a different light. All going well, I&apos;ll be out of here soon.
[SCHOLAR] *Tell her you&apos;ve never seen such a curse. How did Braccus Rex learn it?*
&lt;i&gt;I don&apos;t care about a Gods-damned piece of paper!&lt;/i&gt;
Bed
[UNDEAD] *Say that you actually didn&apos;t feel a thing.*
*Move a bit closer and place a hand upon her knee.*
This potion smells faintly of old books and is capable of boosting your intelligence.
*Lean forward and kiss her red cheeks, then her parted lips.*
*He lowers his head in grave assent.*
It was all I had in the darkness. It was the only thing I could find. Just you. Nothing else.
*Ask the cub what its mother looked... looks like.*
Well well, we made it to the big smoke.
You know what I mean, you miserable dwarven scum! Now leave me be - my Magister comrades are missing, and I&apos;m going to find them.
You. It&apos;s... you.
Ifan. Ifan ben-Mezd: my &lt;i&gt;&apos;killer&apos;...&lt;/i&gt;
*Try to speed things up. &apos;Spleen!&apos;*
A Sourcerer. You... you penetrate my thoughts as she does - yet you leave behind clarity... not fantasy.
Bleeding
*Observe the candles for a moment. You can&apos;t do it - you can&apos;t take their lives.*
If something needs to be crushed, this can certainly handle the crushing.
*Stand back. Allow Saheila&apos;s touch.*
Defeat the Magisters.
*State that he sounds like a mercenary.*
Find the remaining spores.
You... you look &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;like...
Do please bring the Red Prince to me soon!
Go to the Elven Temple.
I know your habit of leaving people behind on boats, but assuming we both make it off this one, I may have a need for you.
Elemental Immunity Aura
How ya holdin&apos; up?
*When you open your eyes you&apos;re back in your old body, senses buzzing with newly-found Source power.*
*Oink* Squee! *Oink* Squee squee!
They are not here. You bring them. Then you fight.
What, then. What is it.
*Tell him that you happen to have it on you. Hand it over.*
*It tastes as raw heart-meat will, with a supple texture, slick with fast-congealing blood. You feel instantly ill. The elven leader gives you a look of what you think might be approval.*
Well. With Murga gone, we&apos;re all hungry for l&apos;il somethin&apos; special. I&apos;ll let ya give it a go. But don&apos;t come cryin&apos; to me if it goes hurtin&apos; yer fee-fees.
*Claim that you are a thrall of Almira, and need to get past.*
I fear it will be quite some time before we find any answers at all, my friend. Though it doesn&apos;t hurt to ponder...
But... but... *cries* bock!
Renegade
Never got to the fire. Now I&apos;m stuck, and ships still crash. Least it&apos;s a pretty view...
Dwarfdom became a centre of production,
Not connected to the [1] servers
*This silent monk, like every other, has nothing to say.*
You gotta, you just gotta! Just light those candles. It&apos;s easy, I swear!
*A low growl. The dog starts to salivate and lick his chops. His eyes go hard and cold. Suddenly, he seems to remember himself and whines.*
Contaminated Corpse
Countless times since your birth have I, and so many Dreamers with me, foiled the attempts of your enemies to assassinate your royal person.
That... I needed that.

*Ask if he&apos;ll be in Arx on Lucian&apos;s Day.*
Create New Campaign
*He stumbles and coughs, then regains his composure. His eyes narrow malevolently.*
*Feeling rightfully relieved and satisfied to have done your duty, you can&apos;t help but notice one of the window shutters stands ajar...*
I no feel hungry anymore. I no feel &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;.
Must be mighty valuable to have been secured so tightly. Could fetch a good sum...
Black Altar Shoes
You shouldn&apos;t spend so much time inside that noggin of yours, my boy! Does you no good.
*Blink. How did he know you&apos;re Godwoken?*
Come now, such folly is beneath you!
Kortan the Stalker
Raise a glass and praise the dwarven race...
A... a &lt;i&gt;mistake&lt;/i&gt; was made. That&apos;s all I have to say on the matter.
Ah, we meet again. Tell me, do you like puppets...?

Leg Armour of the Mercenary
Heal your wounds. We need you standing.
Ya gotta fight yer allies if ya want the spirit of the One to take notice! So - what&apos;ll it be?
You&apos;re right. The gods may be dead. But we still live. That has to mean something...
When we ran out of Blackroot, Siva sent us to the Cloisterwood to replenish our stocks.
That was horrifying, but what choice did the priests have? They couldn&apos;t let that demon run free.
Wait for your host to load the game.
Ready
(No you didn&apos;t, Geraldine. Now shush, I&apos;m going to ask him anyway.)
[ELF] *Ask if you could have just a little morsel... you&apos;re curious to see what &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;happened here...*
Where is everybody?
*Play along and say that it&apos;s alright - mother will take care of him now...*
Your victory gives us hope that the future may be bathed in a Divine&apos;s light, that Lucian may yet have a worthy successor.
Your final punishment is at hand, foolish fugitive!
I might never get another chance to see one...
*Praying? Tell him you know about the horrific experiments he carried out here.*
