And I see you have already brought me some reading material! Kindly give it here, my boy.
*In peril? Who threatens them?*
White Magister Markswoman
Kemm? &lt;i&gt;Linder&lt;/i&gt; Kemm? All the better that he&apos;s avoiding Paulina like the porcine plague, then. The Kemm estate is the only safe haven remaining for me in this burning city.
*Slice back her scalp and set to work on her skull with a bone saw.*
*Ifan stares at the spirit wordlessly for a moment, then turns away.*
But suit yourself, darling.
Water-stained and flecked with fish guts, this journal looks like it has been sitting here untouched for several weeks.
Thankfully I have furnished my basement with all manner of wonders, including a book that will explain everything you need to know.
Midnight Crystal
Dwarven Dagger
After that though, and without the Magisters&apos; help... there&apos;s nowhere to go but the Hollow Marshes. They say they&apos;re haunted, but I don&apos;t believe in bogey men.
Yes, and how is that working out, I wonder?
Character is invulnerable.
It looks like I am right to stop you!
Donna of the Four Sisters
*Take her outstretched hand, knowing that &lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;shall take &lt;i&gt;you...*&lt;/i&gt;
I find that rather hard to believe, but suit yourself.
*She ekes out a few more notes, then smiles at you with the innocence of a newborn.*
Frost Dragon
But how to go about it. These things must be done correctly...
We intervened to help a Paladin sent to investigate Magister activities in Fort Joy. It seems there is dissent in the Divine Order.
*Crack*
Do not do this! DO NOT DO THIS! &lt;i&gt;DO NOT DO THIS - !&lt;/i&gt;
Take root.
Let&apos;s see what we&apos;ve got here...
This is the worst day of my life.
If you choose life, you choose the Well of Ascension! And even without my guidance, you have become a true Master of the Source. You are ready. I will guide you there, but first I have more to teach you...
*Say the sooner you can rest from all this, the better.*
Ifan told us that Lone Wolves hunt the Godwoken.
Soulforged Blade
We wished for riches, and the Djinn gave us a strangely disconcerting necklace.
Deal with Grog the troll.
*With an effusive and slightly disconcerting smile, she shakes all her hair free. Beaming, she hands over a small, delicately-wrapped package.*
*Reach up to undo her restraints.*
Peeper? You found Peeper! That&apos;s Big Marge&apos;s egg. She&apos;ll be wanting him back, yes, wanting him back.
*Wonder what he expects from the new Divine.*
Where would I hide something important, if I was a Magister...?
*Suggest to her that we only come to regret things undone - not things done.*
*Opening the book, you can see it was a meticulously laid out treatise of some kind, but its pages have been covered in angry scrawl, leaving the original text illegible. Of the furious script covering it, you can only make out a few words: traitor, betrayal, apostate, traitor, heretic, traitor, traitor, traitor...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s only when you reach the end of the book that you find a coherent sentence. It mourns the fact that &apos;my people&apos; have been cast to the Void. It swears revenge on &apos;backstabbing lords&apos;, and says they will suffer the darkness they have unleashed on the world. &apos;I will be King again...&apos;*
Formations
Do we have further business?
*He looks at you, incredulous. Then begins to laugh.*
After everything we&apos;ve been through, Fane will help me become Divine.
Vest of Sourcery
Your name, your name! Relent to the Ring and yield your name!
This is why we are Godwoken; we do what needs to be done.
The Seven protect me...
Battle at the Gates
Hand Brace
Is this place really what you had in mind for us?
Wow! Wow, um.. THANKS! A lot! Guys! We got our ball back!
It might be a reproduction, but who&apos;s going to notice?
TROUBLE?! &lt;i&gt;TROUBLE?!&lt;/i&gt; BUBBLING SKIN AND BURNING KNUCKLE, &lt;i&gt;I&apos;LL KILL YOUR SHINING LIGHTS!&lt;/i&gt;
*She responds to your laugh with a dip of her head. She raises a hand, telling you to wait. She produces a mirror of darkest black, holds it as if to look upon her own magnificence... and then speaks, as if to herself.*
I wouldn&apos;t have taken you for a ghoul, but attacking a child? That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;dark!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When.&lt;/i&gt; Not if. And you&apos;ll see for yourself, in time. We&apos;ll make all of Driftwood come and see what happens to those who conspire against us...
*A look of sad resignation, not surprise, floods the spirit&apos;s features.*
Anyhow. What can I get you?
Actions
*Ask where the Meistr might be.*
Few have seen his face, and none know his name. He corresponds only by messenger. The townspeople seldom speak of him - which is strange, now that I think of it.
Ey, Prudey! This guy says he&apos;s doing fine! Hah! What a sap.
*Her eyes go wide with delight upon your mentioning Han.*
*Next thing you know you&apos;re on the ground. His fist came out nowhere.*
The harbour is ruined. There&apos;s no food getting in. I wonder what dead Voidwoken tastes like? Probably chicken. I hate chicken.
Glitter Dust Skillbook
*Take your leave.*
That accursed bell lies with the Peacemaker, on the bottom in the rocky shallows. My compass lies there too.
*Leya looks into your eyes again, nods briefly, and then collapses into Duggans arms.*
P
I am not skilled enough to repair [1].
*Wave her aside. You&apos;d like to take over this interrogation.*
All those souls...!
Cave - Underground Hall
My good, wonderrrrful, exquisite sister. Chosen of Tir-Cendelius. You bring drudanae, yes?
*Tell him to hold still. This might sting. Then consume his Source.*
*You ease your way up to the grave, and run your hand around the lid, searching for a trap - you find nothing. The wind whispers in the trees and the grass rustles quietly. You slide the lid open with a CREAK...*
This isn&apos;t the time for jokes! The Magisters want me dead - please, you have to help!
[IFAN] *Tell her you can&apos;t rest: duty calls.*
[LIZARD] *Tell him indeed you did: you served your Empire.*
*Snuffle*
Mnemonic
Keep your distance, reptile. As for this &apos;den&apos;, you&apos;ll get no silver from me for selling out your friends. Now slither back to your nest.
Shinies. Darkness left, then light again. Warm. Saw glints in sand and dirt.
*Tell him you almost soiled your own breeches watching him talk to that Magister.*
Goodbye, you strange little thing.
[FANE] *Tell her true: you&apos;re an ancient undead looking for his long lost people.*
*Pull on the helmet as hard as you can.*
The hens were unhappy to hear that their last untainted egg was eaten.
The Black Ring have come to the Nameless Isle to stop the Godwoken ascending.
I&apos;m not entirely on board, but go on.
*The mirror goes silent and black.*
*Ask how the Dreamer came to be here.*
You&apos;re happy these mind maggots are trapped inside the jar...
Lonely yet, mate?
*After all that&apos;s just happened, life - every flawed morsel of it - seems more precious to you than ever.*
I&apos;m... glad to hear you say that. We &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;make quite the team, don&apos;t we.
Void-Tainted Yellow Ridgeback
*Look at him quizzically. What does he mean?*
Let&apos;s ask them: Hands up everyone who&apos;s angry with us? No-one? Alright, let&apos;s move on.
Really? You&apos;re very old for that.
I supported my friend in their claim on Divinity. A new Divine has risen.
Good you brought this to me. I&apos;d hate to think what might&apos;a happened to you if you hadn&apos;t.
Very well. You&apos;re not one of the Advocate&apos;s men. But my warning still stands:
Now, now. Not so fast now.
Creates a small ooze surface with a 2m radius.
As I told you before, you&apos;ll need more help than I can provide alone - Lord Arhu to begin with. Now please, don&apos;t waste any more of my time.
He&apos;s &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;. I&apos;m more alone than ever...
Bairdotr
You... you&apos;re shaped like a living thing. Smell like a &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;living thing. You&apos;re not &lt;i&gt;straw &lt;/i&gt;are you...?
*The goddess steps back and waves, the warmth of her hand still lingering over your heart. Then sudden light and lightning, and you are gone.*
Alright, then. Let&apos;s see what I can find.
Oh aye? And yeh&apos;ll say I&apos;ve no choice but to bring you to &apos;em, safe as the midday moon, eh?
Hey hey, now. No reason to be a jerk about it.
You opened the grave! You heard the creak and then the click... AND THEN YOU WERE THE BANG! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
*Ask where this graveyard is and why one should stay away from it.*
Between you and me, huh? Now, there&apos;s a thought. When we first met I thought there might&apos;ve been something there - a spark, you know? But... I guess it faded. A bit, anyway.
Egg Cluster
Hit_Melee_Crit_1
*Say it was hard to tell.*
Hey, oddball. Think I saw a lizard with a scraped knee down the way. Why&apos;n&apos;t you go kiss his booboo?
Examine
*Reach out to him and ask if you can take a closer look at his wounds.*
Enough dillydallying, spiketail. You got my tea?
Bucket
*Tell the rat that&apos;s perfectly natural.*
And if it is... who&apos;s in charge of Fort Joy?
You know, I could tell you all about swamp dreamers too if I chewed that much drudanae.
[1] gives you a +[2] Wits bonus to detecting traps.
She&apos;s a tidal wave that will take wing, become a murder of dragons - red as the setting sun - that will alight every corner of this world with the terrible splendour of fire.
So, the Sourcerer had a Sourcerer&apos;s sword. Fascinating. No wonder Kilgallion fell so fast.
*You no longer look without, but within. You understand where your path must take you.*
Rare
We&apos;ll need to find the song that&apos;ll control it, then. Well, &lt;i&gt;you&apos;ll&lt;/i&gt; need to.
*Give in. She&apos;s right: it&apos;s time to become lovers.*
Azureal Malkii
Undead
*Lie and tell her that you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a master, Champion of all Arenas!*
Hold it together, Leya. You&apos;re doing great.
Hrrmm... well &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; human thanks you for your help...
Greater Fire Ooze
*Say you remember such a crab. You met her in Fort Joy.*
*Consume the Dreamer&apos;s source.*
*She paces around you like a cat, looking you over.*
*Excuse yourself. You have no time for melodramatic turtles.*
I. Am. An. Automaton. &lt;i&gt;*Creak...* &lt;/i&gt;I. Recognise. And. Respond. &lt;i&gt;*Creak...* &lt;/i&gt;Do. Not. Presume. That. I. Have. Self-awareness. &lt;i&gt;*Creak...* &lt;/i&gt;Now. You. Must. Leave.
Magisters... they found our camp near the old harbour, and unleashed hell upon us... I&apos;m lucky in a way... I was wounded by an arrow...
Worn Teddy Bear

Now, let&apos;s be quick. Who knows when the Great Acorn will arrive.
[VILLAIN] *Shrug.*
*Say you have your own path to follow. You don&apos;t have time for diversions.*
Demonic Flayer

Summon a Skeleton.
Not on your life. I got money to make. I&apos;m stayin&apos; glued to my post.
Good to see you again, not-so-stranger! Glad &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; made it here in one piece, unlike me. Any idea what you&apos;re gonna do next?
*Thank him and leave.*
[MYSTIC] *Note that if Tatcher is looking for romance she should look no further than her partner - it must be clear to everyone that Edden here is deeply in love with her.*
I am Zaleskar. I am a Lone Wolf. I am older than the ruins of man. And I have heard of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, Sebille.
The Black Ring are using a cave near the Human Temple.
Gather my bones and see what powers I will grant you.
*Declare that &lt;i&gt;you&apos;re &lt;/i&gt;a Sourcerer, and consume the spirit.*
*Say that it sounds like a tall order.*
*Tell her you&apos;re the one who sent the warning about Magister and Black Ring collusion.*
