Tsch! Don&apos;t worry Zharat, we&apos;d have to be &lt;i&gt;enthusiastically&lt;/i&gt; suicidal to try and take anything from the Silver Claw.
I miss you, Mudbarrow, you old bastard. But I&apos;m keeping your money.
Ruler of a rotting kingdom.
You opened the grave! You heard the creak-click-bang! AND THEN YOU BURNED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
This harmless looking bottle deals [1] damage in a [2] radius.
Good for her. We should all be so free to sever the ties that bind...
*Tell her you&apos;ll be the judge of that.*
When Justinia succeeded Queen Lora, tensions rose. Knowing unity would strengthen the Kingdom, the new queen ruthlessly crushed dissent.
*Ask if the Divine was alive when she enlisted.*
*Ifan boops you on the nose and breaks out laughing. He backs away, clapping you on the back affectionately.*
Crafting
Judging by the dark pools that are your eyes, I&apos;d say you&apos;re seeing yourself.
*Tell Exter you are good to go.*
[DWARF] *Scoff. You&apos;re only being accused because you&apos;re a dwarf.*

I can hear your music, Lohse. Beneath every sigh of breath, a melody. Stay here with me. Rest. Find your peace.
Off you go, then. Just stay out of trouble, got it?
Her triumphs as Champion of Driftwood are known to all dwarves of Reaper&apos;s Coast. This title is not effortlessly earned.
On to the second question. Can you knit, weave, in short: tailor?

Of course you accept! Mine wasn&apos;t an offer: it was an order.

Sunny Warm
It sounds as thought the motions of the sea are upsetting your stomach, not me.
*He peers into Beast&apos;s eyes, looking for a sign of honest intent - and satisfied, his face softens.*
Go on then, bark away. Let&apos;s see if we can find any method in it.
[OUTLAW] *Draw your weapon. These guys have no idea just how unwelcome you can make yourself.*
Global Cooling Scroll

Poisoned Mashed Potatoes
*As your palms press into the warm stone, you feel the depths of your being crack open. Your power flows from you into the relic, yet a reverse current flows back into you with a new power. A &lt;i&gt;different &lt;/i&gt;power.*
Go on then. I watch you, still.
Perhaps that is to be expected from lesser creatures, but it intrigues me. What must it feel like? To slip away from this world and into the next?
F2
That so?
It&apos;s beautiful, isn&apos;t it? Possibly Ramn&apos;s finest work!
&lt;i&gt;I called a hero from the chaff; I called him here to me. I called a hero from below, and he shall set us free.&lt;/i&gt;

I had forgotten that pragmatism is usually partnered with stubborness. Particularly when accompanied by an overabundance of ale.
Mordus&apos; Excavation Site
You&apos;ve come, Lucian be praised!
The resurrected mind is as simple as it is stubborn. My answer remains, as ever: no.
Excellent! Let&apos;s begin immediately. I can compile my notes afterwards.
The Seekers came here to rescue a Sourcerer from the fort. They failed. Many fell.
I - I saw the Lady Amadia. I think... Can anyone truly trust anything in this world?
Behold the gift of a monarch wronged.
Playing this delightful little lute will bless everyone in the vicinity.
Quite sure, Your Majesty.
This invaluable tool for the adept crafter is carved of darkly marbled stone, weathered by years of use and flecked with shards of stardust.
We defeated the four heroes, who seemed to be &apos;Sworn&apos; to someone called &apos;the God King&apos;.
Who were you talking to?! Never mind - I&apos;ll see to them after I&apos;ve dealt with you...
Big Tomorrah said they&apos;d let me in their grubby little guild if I helped &apos;em nab that painting of Kemm&apos;s, The Second Passion of Lucian.
Not enough space!

*Tell the cub you&apos;ll keep an eye out, then ask if by &apos;red men&apos; it means Magisters?*
*Tell her that Sadha has perished.*
We ventured on. Charlie still wants her ball.
What&apos;s this...? It looks like our task&apos;s been done for us - by an &lt;i&gt;outsider &lt;/i&gt;to boot. I am Lord Linder Kemm; I&apos;m in command of the Paladins - and investigating Magister treachery here in Arx.
I hid in a stump. I&apos;m not a stupid squirrel! I have much stowed away for hard times!
A little magpie-feather named Marg! He&apos;s not&lt;i&gt; fit &lt;/i&gt;to be a bridgekeeper.

[JESTER] *Compliment their bravery. After all, they&apos;ll need it when the Seeker army you saw earlier arrives.*
Goat&apos;s cheese? Mother, are you &lt;i&gt;mad?!&lt;/i&gt;
Now go help Ma!
Oh yes? Well - I certainly could use some good news amongst the bad. I am a man of my word. Here is the payment promised, and extra besides.
He must have mixed something into the delightful rose tea he served me. And then... &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt;...?
Platform
Use
I am convinced. Go free. But I am watching you.
This isn&apos;t over.
*Say you&apos;re completely confused.*
We found a pair of dwarven thugs in a hidden chamber. We let them leave.
*Nod your sympathies, and take your leave.*
My queen - forgive me. I... I...
You creatures talk about &apos;right&apos; and &apos;wrong&apos; as if they are carved in stone somewhere for all to see.
*Place a hand under her dress and move it up along her inner thigh.*
*Pat him on the shoulder. Yeah, you know.*
Now that yer all done, why don&apos;t ya just skedaddle on outta here?
I warned you, did I not, of the dangers your abominable offspring would pose? You forced me, once again, to intervene. We are saved - but make no mistake: &lt;i&gt;I am vexed.&lt;/i&gt;
Don&apos;t be bloody soft - that temple has to go, and ten fathoms of water&apos;ll serve just as well as fire and battering rams.
*Turns out it smelled far better than it tastes. You gag, but you hold it down.*
Yes, yes of course, milady! So I shall.
[JESTER] *Sway to the rhythm of his digging. It&apos;s a good beat.*
Fireball Skillbook
In this vision, I saw Rivellon as a... a nothingness. All life was gone; all ground. It was as though nothing had been there at all. Our great people were reduced to... absence.
You have solved the riddle, and shown mastery over the seasons. Now you must face the trial of combat.

Then you&apos;d better be the best mama you CAW-can be! Care for Peeper, and stroke him, and bring him straight to his papa!
You&apos;re a poor liar, Marcus. And it seems I&apos;m a poor secret-keeper.

Guess the gods were smiling on me that day. Or, more likely, laughing at me.
Lizard Monk
BOOOOOOCK! *scratch*
I know just what you mean. Yes, I felt the same while painting it - at turns repulsed and so terribly drawn in...
A man&apos;s gotta make a living somehow. Speaking of which - penny for a dead dog?
Thank you.
If you see any of the Whites, then be sure to let us know. Capturing one of them might make this bloody farce worthwhile.
[UNDEAD] *Shift uneasily. You&apos;re not concerned about &apos;blood and piss&apos;, but you prefer your bones unbroken.*
*No matter what you do, this Watcher&apos;s attention cannot be distracted from whatever inner horrors possess his focus.*
Stand back. Not a foot on these stairs. Whatever words you carry with you, they are warty with futility.
*Tell her you wouldn&apos;t worship a goddess wielding a vengeful needle.*
*Say you recall hearing that Seekers help Sourcerers - doesn&apos;t that mean she has to help you?*
You! You must not defend her. She wakes if she is weakened. We must hurt her to protect her - you see?
Double Damage
[1] is not a rune
The crazed elf Verdas told us we were important but didn&apos;t say why. He seemed afflicted with dark magic.
I&apos;m somewhat of an expert on the subject of disease. Like all Black Ring agents, Isbeil is a tumour. One I intend to excise from Rivellon.
*Tell him you&apos;re taking his boat.*
Eh, throw a few more on the pile. Nothing we can&apos;t manage.
*She stares out over the sparkling sea, a contemptuous smile upon her lips.*
&lt;i&gt;BACAW!&lt;/i&gt;
Bloody Voidwoken at a wedding...? If that ain&apos;t a bad omen, nothing is.
NOT MAMA!
Lord Linder Kemm
Report to our officer at the barracks. He&apos;ll be glad to hear there are still some brave souls in this rats&apos; nest of a town.
*Give him a curt nod, then turn away.*
*As you cup your hands beneath the statue&apos;s feet, the oil spills into your palms and overflows. Looking down into the mirrored pool, you see endless blackness. Eternal, fuligin night...*
There is no shame in loss. We will yet reveal the One.
The Black Ring still swarms all over the island. My followers did their duty, and bought me time to get here. I will honour their sacrifice, after I make it to the Wellspring and ascend.

*She has no more time for conversation with you, absorbed as she is in the intent study of what looks like fresh troll droppings on the ground before her.*
*The soldier looks at you hard, his grip tensing around his spear.*
*She cocks her head to listen to a voice you cannot hear...*
Oppose Dallis.
Flower Pot
Perfect...
*Challenge him to try it.*
I promise you, there ain&apos;t nothing you can offer that&apos;s worth more to me than what he promised. All he asks in return is I kill the occasional breather...
Ha! Here today, gone tomorrow. Life&apos;s a dream, isn&apos;t it?
*Tell him you&apos;ve met a Delorus. Offer to trade information. The whereabouts of his brother for the whereabouts of the White Magisters.*
A word of warning to you, Sebille, one you would do well to heed: &lt;i&gt;Do not make the Doctor wait - and do bring Lohse with you.&lt;/i&gt;
Dummy
*You cannot deny your hunger. Consume her Source.*
*You hunger for his Source. Consume it.*
Glowing brightly with a spectral blue brilliance, it almost hurts to gaze at it too long. This Source Orb can be used to gain a Source Point, or used in place of a rune on your equipment, or used as an ingredient in special crafting recipes. Use it wisely!
All my life, I&apos;ve tried to protect Arx... now she&apos;s fallen, and I could do nothing. There&apos;s no reason for me to be here. Not anymore.
And never again. The spores are creation magic. Old enough that even we Scions forget.
&apos;ullo.
*The formidable dwarf slams his fist on the side table. You hear a loud crack.*
*Shriekers. Thank him for the warning.*
Cmd
*Punch him square in the face.*
*Ask him where your reward can be found.*
*Say it feels pretty daunting.*
How tedious. A self-imposed fool is he who never stops to think.
Lambo the Dog
Sarias dies, but Sarias&apos;s tree is born. A homeland may arise once more, if all is well. For this, we fight.
*Godwoken? Defiantly sneer you are Sebille. There is nothing else to &apos;realise&apos;.*
Don&apos;t you want to be free of what came before?
Candor
Oh, but I am. My daughter returns to us. My dearest one - a &lt;i&gt;Scion &lt;/i&gt;- returns to us.
I do not deal with thieves. I kill thieves.
*He looks at you... his lip quivers... wobbles...*
*Gratiana looks after you in confusion as you walk away.*
Be wary. That hound has a nose for Source.
