These fresh bones bear the tooth-marks of a small-to-middling sized dog. And more besides. Beneath the little toothmarks, you can see dried venom... and the swaddling of enormous cobwebs.
They are changed. That Dallis woman did something to their minds. They won&apos;t be moved, and they can&apos;t be healed - they resist it at all costs.
[OUTLAW] *Your eyes narrow. She isn&apos;t lying, but there&apos;s something about the way she said that...*
Don&apos;t mistake compassion for wisdom, Lohse. Adramahlihk will have no compassion for you when he comes to possess your soul.
I know, dear child. I have seen your struggles. But they are nothing compared to what would befall us all if you turn from this path.
*Smile and agree. You never dreamed you&apos;d end up here.*
*Alexandar&apos;s spirit clasps his hands together in prayer - it is cut short, and he is no more.*
Bed
What the cheese wheel loses in mass, you gain in social stature.
You... It is you... I have found you... The red, dead prince... The vermin...
*Zaleskar&apos;s shrivelled heart is tough to chew. The stringy meat is so vilely bitter it brings tears to your eyes.*
Character is super lucky!
Hungry Flower Scroll
Travel to the land without a name. Another piece is hidden behind a path of symbols.*
Volumes. But the prophecies are meant for divine... wait.
*The spirit looks at his own translucent hand, &lt;i&gt;mesmerised&lt;/i&gt;...*
This place is no haven for innocents. Farewell, my furry friend.
*Take your leave. He&apos;s welcome to rot in a cave if he wants to.*
*The spirit of a dwarf woman scowls at you like you dealt her some grave insult while she was alive.*
My word...
*Tell her you&apos;re not.*
Yes. Yes. We should... we should get back to real life, eh?
*Say it&apos;ll feel a lot better when you&apos;re at the Well of Ascension, becoming a god.*
Basic Axe
Let this be a lesson to Alexandar and his cronies. We will &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;be held.
The day will come we&apos;ll overthrow &apos;em, you mark my words! Until then, I&apos;ll practice the art o&apos; gutting on spoiled fish.
Meet your maker.
A skeleton! Run!
Skin Graft Skillbook
Radeka the Witch
Ma&apos;am, at the service of the realm! Ma&apos;am!
*Ask him what&apos;s wrong with the dog.*
Flaming Crossbow
Name Pin
*What you &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; is good Source going to waste. Consume the dwarf&apos;s Source...*
*The leaves of the altar rustle, a gentle murmur on the breeze. You lean in, a sweet smell wafting around you. The smell of fresh wood, of blooming flowers, of a gentle summer&apos;s night.*
*Lean down and scratch behind the dog&apos;s ears. Tell him you couldn&apos;t lie to such a good li&apos;l doggie.*
HALT. State your name. NOW!
WARRIORS! ATTACK!
You can&apos;t go in, missus. The Meista isn&apos;t home an&apos; the magistas locked the door.
Yes. Her.
Smashing Blouse
*Wonder if this will involve a leaf falling on the other side of Rivellon?*
*With a jerk, your mind is pulled to a scene in a tavern. You see a dwarf in the centre of the room, joking as all around roar with laughter. All bar the zombies, who are slavishly serving food and drink.*
Do not be frightened. You have friends in Arx.
*Despite the cold, you muse, the Undead can be exceedingly... hot.*
...no harm. No harm. Noharmnoharmnoharm...
No. Nothing would induce me to trust a lizard. Night night, Red Prince...
A Magister&apos;s note to an unknown recipient.
Don&apos;t let it see you.
Leave me be now, darling. I&apos;ve plans to make.
*Ask him why he waits at the keep - what business has he here?*
Bugger off.
Empty Djinn Lamp
Oh, they&apos;re Seekers.
Necromancer Rask
Whatever her troubles might&apos;ve been, they&apos;re over now.
So: A world full of Sourcerers. What do you make of it?
Busy day in the garden. Maybe too busy.
Finding Emmie
*Say that in your experience world atlases tend to be better suited for bludgeoning.*
Deer Hunter

Visions of Alexandar, Malady, and Windego emerged from mirrors and tried to kill us.
Crafty Weaponry: Die by the Sword
Rhetorician
Seek out somewhere that peddles ferocity herb mixes, but make an addition - one of these, eh, &lt;i&gt;unique &lt;/i&gt;breams...
*The spirit fights hard against you. Through its rage you can see flashes of Arx - a palatial home. A stern, grey-haired man. The clink of coin and a swift exit back onto the streets...*
Out of the kindness of your heart? No, I think not, Godwoken. You &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;something.
Isn&apos;t the sea breeze marvellous, darling? I mean, asides from that rancid &lt;i&gt;smell&lt;/i&gt;...
Companion Dialogues
Papa Thrash
Monster! &lt;i&gt;Blasphemer! &lt;/i&gt;I will offer no aid to one who feeds upon others like a carrion bird! Away from me!
*Ask how they knew about the hidden passage into the sewers.*
*The lizard blinks her eyes rapidly. She says not another word to you, but turns her back and addresses Han once more.*
*Note Beast&apos;s rising discomfort, and tell The Doctor he&apos;ll be talking to you, not Beast.*
That so? Oh hey, you&apos;re right; reckon the lizard I&apos;m thinkin&apos; of was got rid of last week. Probably for the best; Griff cut him real good.
*Say there&apos;s no reason not to just kill him now, if he&apos;s only going to match Dorian&apos;s offer.*
The Well of Ascension, I must assume. You&apos;ll find the Wellspring there, an ingress into which the endless ocean of Source flows. Drink of it, Godwoken, and you will be Divine.
Free! Free at last...
*Hold on just a moment. Is he saying you must &lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; together?*
*The three of you turn to the see where this new voice came from. You soon lock eyes with a vile-looking lizard, his face the very definition of mischief.*
The hatchlings- they- they ate us &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;. They ate us &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;.
Ah, hello, my friend. I am so very relieved now that my precious cargo has been returned to me. So very, very relieved.
Forward.
Ah, a friendly face. Ish. C&apos;mon, let&apos;s find the others!
*Agree. Better an offended Magister than a death on your conscience.*
Infect Skillbook
*Ask: &lt;i&gt;&apos;What kind of person is a contract killer?&apos;*&lt;/i&gt;
Shinies!
That&apos;s the welcome they offered the law-abiding Magisters that came to keep the people safe. Ain&apos;t that right, woman?
I heard tell she managed to get away from all that nasty business in time! Praise Lucian!
We met a boy called Han, who was looking for someone named Verdas, but arrived too late.
*Lean close to his face and whisper; he &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; has a problem.*
Knowledge
And &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;Scion...
*Squint as though you don&apos;t understand what he means.*
Things will be quieter without Mack around, that insufferable lout...
Breastplate
The result of a spirit forged to a crossbow, this soulforged weapon fair hums with Source.
Sewn Scale Boots
*Point to the bound Magister. Her prisoner?*
Ha! With an attitude like that, you oughta join up with the Order. They&apos;re always on the lookout for fighters like you. &apos;specially these days.
You there, scaled one! You&apos;re trespassing in the Princess&apos;s Royal Court!
Wise. You see what I do to thieves at Fort Joy.
Good thing I needn&apos;t worry about splinters.
[This manuscript about the human god Rhalic is - or was - clearly in progress.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each of the Seven took the Source they received from their devotees in worship, and used it to gain power. Rhalic, the first of the Seven, become the patron of the humans, encouraging them to be fruitful and multiply.
Found Limb
*The young woman lies in a heap on the floor. She&apos;s breathing normally, but her eyes are wide open, like those of a corpse. Dark, greyish-black clouds swirl through them.*
And then there are the self-styled heroes like you charging in there, thinking they&apos;re just going to cut down that demonic foliage with a slice or two. Not likely. You heard me, mister: You&apos;re part of the problem!
I dunno. Would seem Justinia&apos;s got the willpower of a hungry Source hound. But that means what she can get talked into, she can be talked out of.
Deathmatch
A candle is a soul. It&apos;s not my place to destroy this many souls.
*He pauses for a long moment, his eyes lingering on your weapon.*
Mutators
*Tell her you&apos;ve seen all this region can show you. You could make a powerful ally.*
Magister&apos;s Air Staff
[JESTER] *Tell him he missed nothing - Alexandar was disgusting.*
Erma&apos;s her name. She&apos;s about as high as your hip. Black of hair. A quiet child. Not prone to wandering off.
This won&apos;t be the first double-cross. I&apos;m a wanted man.
*She leans forward and smiles.*
*A familiar figure materialises before you - a copy of yourself, enraged. Your own face glowers at you in hateful fury. It opens its mouth...*
You&apos;re really ticking me OFF, Marla.
We wished for knowledge, and were rewarded with a book of childrens&apos; tales.
This character can see spirits.
*Agree. He should go find help for himself.*
When the Sourcerer went mad, only those who could flee were spared a terrible death. The fleet-footed Shadowblade escaped, but the rest of the village did not.   As a wandering orphan, thieves, beggars, pirates, and murderers taught the Shadowblade that man was no more than a beast, and the laws of nature were simple: Kill or be killed; eat or go hungry.   But a survivor among survivors needed an advantage. Posing as the child of nobleman, it was almost easy to gain access to the Academy of the Source Hunters. Here the most elite secrets of magic were offered freely, and the Shadowblade perfected them all.  By the time the ruse was discovered, it was too late. The academy had a prized pupil, and the Shadowblade had found that hunting Sourcerers satisfied the soul better than picking pockets. Usually.
*They have no mandate for keeping her locked up. Demand she be released.*
Goo
*The lizard closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and begins to speak... inside your head. Her voice transfixes you, in a warm and pleasant way. But soon the treacle in her words begins to nauseate...*
Only a Godwoken, blessed with the blood of heroes, may ascend to Divinity. But few are left. We knew of one - Verdas. He is why we came here...
*Ask about the other Magister prisoner - is she anyone important?*
The Black Ring Sourcerer Almira and her runaway Magister lover are trapped. If we help them, Almira will teach us to master our Source.
Yes, I see it in you. You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; certain. Then that makes my next step all the simpler.
Accelerating Leap
Weapons. Weapons great and small. Weapons solid and floating through the breeze.
*Tell him you know a fellow by that name - a Seeker. You came to Reaper&apos;s Coast on the same ship, even.*
The mathematics are not difficult to figure out.
... you really should.
The lizard mind is as simple as it is stubborn. My answer remains, as ever: no.
Iron Cuirass
You&apos;d... &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;&apos;d help &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt;
Your kind obviously lack the sophistication to understand basic business principles, but it may interest you to know that there&apos;s a market for everything. You just have to find it. Or...
[JESTER] *Tell him that happiness and smiles are what&apos;s most valuable to you in life.*
*Ask why she covers her eyes.*
*The priestess cowers back from you, speeding up her fervent prayer. Her words descend into a senseless babble. A lone tear rolls down her cheek.*
What a mess I&apos;ve made. Someone will be along to clean up, I&apos;m sure.
There are Shriekers on the Nameless Isle. There must be Magisters nearby.
*Say that you&apos;re going to proceed into the tomb, and ask if he intends to try and stop you.*
We are not done here. You have a purpose - a tremendous purpose as yet unfulfilled. Hear what I must tell you - then you will be free to leave.
In a final heartbeat.
